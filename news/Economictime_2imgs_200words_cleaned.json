{"title": "Apple likely to make more iPhones in India this year", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_4_News_0>Apple is expected to make 11-12 million iPhones in India through its three contract manufacturers in 2022, up from 7.5 million in 2021, underlining the growing importance of the South Asian nation to the US firm’s plans. This would mean Apple’s India plants will contribute 5-7% of global shipments and meet 85% of local demand, which is expected to touch record highs in 2022, said market trackers.This compares with a little over 3% contribution to global shipments in 2021 and less than 1.5% in 2020. At the same time, mainland China’s contribution is expected to drop to 91.2-93.5% of global shipments in 2022, from 95.8% in 2021 and 98.2% in 2020, said Counterpoint Research.The development comes as Apple and other US tech giants expand their manufacturing footprint outside China amid heightened geopolitical tensions and pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions.“In India, over 7.5 million iPhones were made last year; we expect a sharp rise in local production of iPhones,” said Saynam Chaurasia, analyst at Canalys. “The company is also gearing up to produce the iPhone 14 locally, beginning production much sooner compared to the older generation iPhones launch dates.” Foxconn, one of the company’s contract manufacturers in India, is expected to make a small batch of the upcoming iPhone 14, launching worldwide September 7, just six weeks behind China, according to noted Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo, indicating that by next year, production of the latest iPhones in India could start simultaneously.“The iPhone 14’s mass production schedule in India this year is still about six weeks behind China, but the gap has improved significantly,” the analyst tweeted. “Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that India and China will be able to produce the new iPhone 15 at the same time next year.”<IMG Economictime_PL_4_News_1>Apple started manufacturing in India in 2017 with the first-generation iPhone SE. Its three electronics manufacturing service (EMS) partners — Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron — make the iPhone 11, iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models in the country.Locally made iPhones are expected to account for 85% of domestic demand in 2022, with only around 15%, primarily the Pro models that do not get made in India, imported from other countries, according to CyberMedia Research (CMR) data.The contribution of assembled-in-India iPhones to local sales was 50% in 2019 after Apple roped in Foxconn as one of the three manufacturing partners, and jumped to 73% in 2021, according to CMR.The rise in manufacturing capability came on the back of the government’s Rs 41,000 crore production-linked incentive scheme for mobile manufacturing. All three contract manufacturers are part of the scheme.“Apple now has three EMS (partners), its highest since it started assembling in India,” said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint Research. “Plus, the PLI benefits and clarity in government policies will further drive Apple suppliers to ramp up in India for its other product categories as well.”ET reported in April that Apple’s contract manufacturers are expected to make iPhones worth Rs 47,000 crore in India in 2022, higher than the minimum required to achieve eligibility for the second year of the PLI scheme.Buoyed by local manufacturing and financing schemes, Apple’s market share in India is expected to increase to 5.5% in India this year, according to CMR, with shipments hovering around the 7.5 million mark, its highest ever in the country, up from 5 million units and 4.4% market share in 2021.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/apple-likely-to-make-more-iphones-in-india-this-year/articleshow/94012636.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_4_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_4_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-94012627,width-300,imgsize-22694,,resizemode-4,quality-100/iphone-14-cover.jpg"}, {"caption": "india calling", "id": "Economictime_PL_4_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-94012643,quality-100/india-calling.jpg"}]}

Reliance Retail, for example, posted more than 60% on-year growth in digital and new commerce business in the quarter ended September. These channels' contribution to its overall revenues rose to 18% in the period, Gaurav Jain, head of strategy and business development at Reliance Retail, told analysts at a recent earnings call. In FY22, it was 17%. This is despite the country's largest retailer reporting its highest-yet offline sales and footfall in physical stores at 118 million during the quarter. <IMG Economictime_PL_50_News_1>HUL managing director Sanjiv Mehta said in the latest earnings call that digital demand capture, including sales of direct to consumer, ecommerce and business to business orders placed digitally, accounts for over 20% of the total sales of the country's largest consumer goods maker. The proportion remains the same as it was in the last fiscal.Rival ITC said in its earnings presentation that it is fast-tracking presence in ecommerce, including expansion of its own direct-to-consumer estore, with the channel accounting for over 7% of non-cigarette FMCG sales. For Dabur, ecommerce now contributes to 9% of its revenue, up from 6% at the end of 2021-22, while for Tata Consumer Products, ecommerce's contribution in India business sales rose to 9.2% last quarter from 7.3% last fiscal. Dabur India chief executive officer Mohit Malhotra said in the earnings call that the demand growth in urban India is being driven by emerging channels like modern trade and ecommerce. \"Ecommerce was, in fact, the standout performer during the second quarter with 50% growth,\" he said. The company's digital first launches like the baby care range, ghee, cold pressed mustard oil and peanut butter will end the current fiscal with annualised sales of ₹100 crore, he said.The shift to digital sales boomed during the last two fiscals of the pandemic when offline trade faced a lot more restriction from governments, and firms started focusing on online in a major way due to changing demand. In the pre-Covid period of 2019-20, online sales used to account for a meagre 1-3% of total sales for most firms and retailers. Shoppers Stop MD Venu Nair said the departmental store chain clocked highest ever gross sales through digital channels, which accounted for 8% of revenue despite the large base in 2021-22. He said a large portion of the sales offline is also influenced by the digital presence.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/covid-wanes-but-online-sales-continue-to-grow-for-brands/articleshow/95238391.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_50_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_50_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-95238586,width-300,imgsize-62298,,resizemode-4,quality-100/covid-virus-agencies.jpg"}, {"caption": "Capture", "id": "Economictime_PL_50_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-95238548,quality-100/capture.jpg"}]}

The regulator had mandated the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, to conduct a detailed report on front-of-pack labelling for packaged and processed foods in the middle of last year, the first time an external entity was roped in for the purpose. The draft guidelines are expected to be introduced by year end, following which, the final guidelines will be released. The move is expected to significantly impact consumption of packaged foods.Health advocacy groups have flagged that the regulator needs to introduce the labelling guidelines, which have been in draft stages for more than seven years, urgently to curb consumption of foods with sugar and salt in excess of threshold limits.\"Health and wellness will continue to remain a key consumer trend and we are positioned to cater to this demand,\" said Prashant Parameswaran, managing director of Tata Consumer Soulfull, marking the Soulfull brand's extension to oats this week.India is now the world's fastest growing health foods market and forecasted to become a $30 billion sector by 2026, Avendus Capital said in a report.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/food-and-beverage-companies-going-heavy-on-diet-product-launches-campaigns/articleshow/92860555.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_88_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Health advocacy groups have flagged that the regulator needs to introduce the labelling guidelines, which have been in draft stages for more than seven years, urgently to curb consumption of foods with sugar and salt in excess of threshold limits.", "id": "Economictime_PL_88_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-92860651,width-300,imgsize-521863,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-10.jpg"}, {"caption": "Capture", "id": "Economictime_PL_88_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-92860659,quality-100/capture.jpg"}]}

All three executives were nominated post holders under rules of aviation regulator DGCA.This means these positions will have to be compulsorily filled up before the airline's first flight. Senior Jet Airways executives said the airline is already in the process of filling up the positions by the end of September. Another senior executive, Vishesh Khanna, who was appointed vice president-sales, distribution and customer engagement in March, has also quit and joined IndiGo.\"Exits and entries occur in any organisation.

{"title": "Parle wants to bite into biscuit maker Dr Gerard in Poland", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_115_News_0>Parle Products, India's largest biscuits company, is in talks with private equity firm Bridgepoint to consider buying Dr Gerard, the second largest biscuits producer in Poland, said people aware of the matter.The Polish biscuit maker, which was once part of Groupe Poult of France, was bought by EU middle-market-focussed Bridgepoint for an undisclosed amount in October 2013. The company is currently valued at Rs 1,000-1,200 crore, though one of the people said it could be as high as $200-300 million euros (about Rs 1,600-2,400 crore).Bridgepoint appointed Houlihan Lokey for Dr Gerard exit earlier this year but the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the geopolitical volatility in Europe slowed the process considerably. There is still no guarantee if Parle’s negotiations will lead to a transaction, the people said. <IMG Economictime_PL_115_News_1>Bridgepoint declined to comment on the specifics but confirmed that a formal sale process was ongoing. Parle did not comment.\"There were some initial talks held and it (Parle) has not progressed into anything significant yet\" said a senior official close to the development, seeking anonymity.Dr Gerard, which was launched in 1993, has a portfolio of over 200 biscuits and salty snacks and two production facilities in Poland. Its core business is in cookies and chocolate products. Its products are exported to 30 countries.The initial discussions with Parle, said the people, were focussed on contract manufacturing opportunities but then Bridgepoint decided to put the company on the block.If successful, this will be the first acquisition by Parle, a conservative company with focus on building brands instead of buying them.\"Biscuit makers are all trying to upgrade their offering through premiumisation. Parle is still predominantly a mass brand and an acquisition will help accessing a ready-made portfolio. Dr Gerald has been a target for long because it's PE-owned but Parle has never bought anything in India, leave alone cross border. So it will be interesting,\" said a Mumbai-based investment banker who specialises in consumer deals. \"They certainly have the balance sheet but historically been a very conservative group.\"For a record 10 years in a row, Parle has topped the rankings for most chosen FMGG brands, according to a report by Kantar India. It is followed by Amul, Britannia, Clinic Plus and Tata Consumer Products in the latest 2021 report, which ranks the most chosen FMCG brands based on consumer reach points.The company which retails brands such as Parle G, Monaco and Melody posted sales of Rs 13,682 crore for March 2021, outpacing rivals including Britannia and Nestle to become the country's biggest food company by annual revenue.Dr Gerard operates in a fragmented but growing market which is open to further consolidation and suits Parle's strategy of expansion through a “selective buy and build” strategy in Poland and other Central and Eastern European markets.The biscuits category grew 11-12% in terms of value in FY22 in India and about 4-5% in terms of volume growth, industry sources said. Parle has started seeing a revival in growth since the first quarter of the year and is betting big on the two newly launched categories of packaged atta (flour) and cereals.After two years of constant price hikes, companies producing consumer goods have started cutting prices and offering discounts. Parle Products for example is giving discounts since August but it has not reduced the maximum retail price. The biscuit major is offering 10-15% discounts on its bigger packs. This will last till the end of the festive season.The company expects 20-25% growth in exports on the back of the government's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme in the food processing sector, for which it has received approval, according to a senior company executive. The company, which exports its products to over 100 countries, feels that the PLI scheme will help it in becoming cost competitive, besides increasing competitiveness abroad with offerings of quality products.According to a report by BlueWeave Consulting, the India biscuits market is growing at a CAGR of 12.4 % and is expected to reach $11.7 billion by 2027.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/parle-is-hungry-for-polish-biscuit-maker-dr-gerard/articleshow/94926702.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_115_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The initial discussions with Parle, said the people, were focussed on contract manufacturing opportunities but then Bridgepoint decided to put the company on the block.", "id": "Economictime_PL_115_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-94926788,width-300,imgsize-51270,,resizemode-4,quality-100/parle.jpg"}, {"caption": "g1", "id": "Economictime_PL_115_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-94926778,quality-100/g1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Unlocking the growth potential of Indian tech companies with the launch of ONDC", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_117_News_0>India’s burgeoning e-commerce market is expected to reach US$120 billion by 2026, a more than a threefold increase from US$38 billion in 2021, according to a joint report by FICCI-Anarock. Despite the booming market, the Indian e-commerce sector is largely dominated by a few big players like home-grown online marketplace Flipkart and global tech giant Amazon. The government’s push to bolster the sector through favourable policies and tech infrastructure development is expected to democratise digital trade in the country and propel the next wave of growth for the e-commerce sector. <IMG Economictime_PL_117_News_1>Indian e-commerce market has tremendous potential with the right supportOne game-changing initiative is the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) established by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).Within the next five years, the ONDC aims to sign up 900 million buyers and 1.2 million sellers and enable US$48 billion in gross merchandise value. In the next two years, the initiative aims to raise e-commerce penetration in the country to 25% from the current level of 5%.With an aim to promote open networks for all aspects of the exchange of goods and services over digital or electronic networks, the government-backed network is expected to shape the future of e-commerce by providing a level playing field for millions of local e-commerce players and tech start-ups across the country. As ONDC opens up the opportunities and levels the playing field, the next set of challenges for these up-and-coming e-commerce and tech companies will be to scale fast and capture the upside while keeping profitability in check.Debt financing is critical for start-ups to scale and growThe Southeast Asia e-commerce sector has much to offer when it comes to unlocking and supporting growth. Southeast Asia’s digital economy has expanded and developed rapidly in the last decade, and has drawn a great deal of attention due to its growth potential. Southeast Asia’s digital economy is expected to grow to US$1 trillion by 2030, and this is where DBS saw an opportunity in debt financing. DBS, as one of Asia’s leading banks, has embedded itself in the ecosystem of the digital economy and played a key role in maximising the growth of next-generation companies by closing the funding gap and enabling digital solutions towards sustainable growth. For instance, the bank recently established the Digital Economy Group (DEG) which is dedicated to supercharging the growth of emerging tech companies by providing strategic advice and innovative growth debt solutions.Santanu Mitra, Managing Director of DEG, explains: “The key objective is to help start-ups by advising them on not just equity fundraising, debt fundraising, and product ecosystem financing, but also provide strategic support.” Furthermore, Mitra sees DEG fitting into the debt space seamlessly. “We started thinking about how we structure debt solutions, and began evolving our banking products to bring the pool of capital directly to start-ups to meet their capital needs and turbo-charge their growth. This way, there is no equity dilution for the founders and the venture capitalists.”DBS also jointly developed a growth debt fund with Temasek—named EvolutionX Debt Capital—to act as the catalyst for businesses ranging from start-ups to unicorns.“EvolutionX Debt Capital has been set up to address growth debt with a ticket size of 20 to 50 million US dollars across Asia,” says Mitra.”Southeast Asian case studies show debt financing coupled with strategic support is invaluableIt is evident from success stories that have emerged from Southeast Asia’s e-commerce space, just how powerful the combination of debt financing and strategic support can be. For instance, in 2021, DBS extended an Rp2 trillion uncommitted revolving short-term loan without any special guarantees or collateral to leading Indonesian e-commerce company Bukalapak. The loan facility helped to strengthen Bukalapak's financial position and support its strategy to diversify funding sources other than equity.In addition, DBS co-created an award-winning Virtual Account (VA) payment-type solution that helped eight million small-business owner partners on the Mitra Bukalapak platform reach a large pool of underserved customers. By embedding this payment solution in the platform, unbanked customers — i.e. people who lack access to bank accounts and credit cards — can submit a cash payment through Bukalapak partner outlets.With DBS APIs enabling real-time online payment and bank verification, Bukalapak merchants can enjoy instant and secure payment processing, providing a new revenue stream through VA payments and ensuring seamless and scalable reconciliation.In India, the bank has partnered with leading dairy-tech startup Stellapps to promote digitalisation amongst small dairies across the country and create a positive impact in the community. The partnership is expected to benefit over 100,000 dairy farmers in the near future.In line with its vision to support promising startups in India, DBS Bank India has joined hands with startup venture capital fund Anthill Ventures and evangelist network Headstart Network Foundation to launch DBS Business Class foundED in April this year. The forum will bridge the gaps in the technology and capital spectrum of the startup ecosystem by bringing the right stakeholders to co-invent and co-innovate, thereby fostering collaborations in the startup ecosystem. The inaugural foundED forum was held in Hyderabad and attended by founders, investors, and tech ecosystem partners, and the subsequent forums will be held across various cities in India, including Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai.Another example is Singapore’s leading car marketplace, Carro. In its early stages, Carro partnered with DBS to create Singapore’s largest direct buyer-to-seller car marketplace. Explains Aaron Tan, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer: “Our relationship with DBS Bank extends beyond the traditional banking infrastructure. We were able to leverage the bank’s network of customers, as well as the bank’s know-how and the brand’s reputation.”Indian tech start-ups can unlock the potential of the digital economy by tapping into DBS’ expertise to maximise their growth as they ride the next wave of e-commerce sector growth on the back of the successful implementation of the ONDC network.Visit dbs.com.sg/corporate/industries/digital-economy-group to learn how DBS’ Digital Economy Group can help you find the business solutions you need to maximise your growth.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/unlocking-the-growth-potential-of-indian-tech-companies-with-the-launch-of-ondc/articleshow/94962136.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_117_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_117_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-94962120,width-650,imgsize-206606,,resizemode-4,quality-100/shantanu-mitra_lead-image_640x480.jpg"}, {"caption": "GettyImages-1319293356", "id": "Economictime_PL_117_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-94962648,quality-100/gettyimages-1319293356.jpg"}]}

This helped them compete with nearly 600 online-only brands, especially in the premium segment, as well as learn from their nimbler rivals in the digital space.\"We will take the equity of Dabur by bringing digital exclusive brands to brick-and-mortar stores. The idea is to connect with younger consumers and then shift them back to traditional trade to build a larger business,\" Dabur India chief executive officer Mohit Malhotra told ICICI Securities analysts, adding that consumers are more experimental in ecommerce versus traditional trade. \"The question is whether new brands will lose their sheen in brick-and-mortar stores against 100-year-old brands. They will struggle in brick and mortar if they offer similar premium versus old brands.\"Dabur has taken its baby-care range, mustard oil, ghee, pickles and apple cider vinegar offline to large chains. For fast-moving consumer goods companies, traditional retailers, including kirana stores, account for 85% of their overall business followed by modern trade at nearly 10%, while ecommerce contributes 5-6% of sales.Emami managing director Harsha V Agarwal said the company is extending a few D2C products to large retail chains, and when they have good potential, will be launched in general trade as well. \"Ecommerce is a channel where it is easy to test the market, but we will take products which have potential where it's convenient for consumers to buy,\" he said.Several mainstream companies have acquired online-first brands in the past three years. For instance, Colgate Palmolive bought a stake in Bombay Shaving Company, Emami purchased a majority stake in The Man Company, while Marico acquired stake in Just Herbs and Beardo and ITC recently acquired a stake in Mother Sparsh. Last year, HUL set up a premium business unit, an incubator to dial up innovation within its product portfolio and compete with new-age brands.In January year, HUL managing director Sanjiv Mehta said a significant part of D2C brands' growth is driven by existing shoppers shifting to online channels instead of incremental growth. \"You may find some time that certain trends are captured by some company before us and so be it,\" Mehta said. \"Not all the trends would be captured first always by us and we could be second and still be better.\"According to a report by HDFC Securities, the potential impact of D2C on domestic revenue of mainstream companies could be more than 30% for large firms such as HUL, Dabur, Godrej Consumer and Emami, and more than 20% for Nestle, Marico and Colgate.Companies remain unperturbed. Tata Consumer Products managing director Sunil D'Souza said a lot of D2C brands start well, grow at triple digits rate and then come offline. \"Businesses need to be present on both offline and online channels to play the game. But offline is a difficult game,\" he said at an ICICI Securities analyst meeting.At present, only 5% of the 600 companies in the D2C segment have achieved the ₹100 crore revenue milestone while 20% have revenue between ₹20-90 crore, and the rest of them below ₹20 crore each, which may see consolidation going forward, according to India D2C Summit 2022. Zydus Wellness non-executive chairman Sharvil Patel recently told analysts the market opportunity is expanding with the D2C brands driving good traction. \"These products can become 20-25% of the market in the long term.

{"title": "Nothing Phone (1) to launch in India via Flipkart soon. Check out leaked specs", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_342_News_0>Nothing is all set to launch its much-awaited smartphone the Nothing phone 1. The company led by Carl Pei has not divulged any specific details about the launch, however, it has dropped hints on its major plans for its first smartphone.

{"title": "Reliance to add local fizz to Cola market with Campa buy, plans Diwali launch", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_347_News_0>Soft drink brand Campa, once the market leader with its Cola variant Campa Cola, is going to make a comeback in October, thanks to Reliance Industries which has acquired the brand as part of its strategy to scale up the FMCG business.Reliance has acquired the brand from Delhi-based Pure Drinks Group in a deal estimated at about ₹22 crore, said two people aware of the development.Reliance will relaunch the Campa brand nationally in the iconic cola flavour, lemon and orange through its own stores and kiranas taking on the fight with the American cola giants, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. In fact, it was on the entry of these two giants in the 1990s that led to the slow death of Campa. <IMG Economictime_PL_347_News_1>\"Campa will be relaunched around Diwali through the Reliance Retail stores, JioMart and the over 15 lakh kiranas who buy products from Reliance's B2B network,\" an executive said, requesting anonymity. \"Eventually, it will be scaled up across the country when Reliance builds the FMCG distribution network.\"An email sent to Reliance and Pure Drinks Group remained unanswered till Tuesday press time.The acquisition of the Campa brand is part of Reliance's strategy to scale up the FMCG business and give it a dedicated focus with its own private labels as well as through acquisition of once popular and regional brands.Industry executives said Reliance is also in advanced stages of talks with a popular South-based soap, edible oil and namkeen brands and due diligence is currently on.\"Reliance has identified almost two dozen potential brands which can be acquired or for joint ventures to strengthen the FMCG business. A couple of deals have already fallen through due to high valuations sought. Reliance's strategy is to go for small sized deals valued at a few crores,\" an executive said. Campa Cola was conceived by Pure Drinks Group - which originally was the bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola - after Coke was asked to leave India in the late 1970s. Campa Cola's slogan was \"The Great Indian Taste\". It along with soft drink brands developed by Parle - Thums Up, Gold Spot and Limca - were dominating the market. Coca-Cola subsequently acquired the three Parle brands on its reentry, while Campa could not compete.Pure Drinks had tried multiple times to revive Campa Cola and the brand, with the last ditch effort in 2019, but failed due to lack of financial strength to take on the American beverage giants.Isha Ambani, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani's daughter and a director in the retail holding company - Reliance Retail Ventures, on Monday announced in the annual general meeting that Reliance will launch the FMCG business this year with an objective to \"develop and deliver high quality, affordable products which solve every Indian's daily needs\".", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/reliance-to-add-local-fizz-to-cola-market-with-campa-buy-plans-diwali-launch/articleshow/93889042.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_347_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Reliance has acquired the brand from Delhi-based Pure Drinks Group in a deal estimated at about ₹22 crore, said two people aware of the development.", "id": "Economictime_PL_347_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-93889067,width-300,imgsize-30104,,resizemode-4,quality-100/reliance-industries.jpg"}, {"caption": "g2", "id": "Economictime_PL_347_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93889077,quality-100/g2.jpg"}]}
{"title": "The Korean wave: From Samsung to Jungkook, a one-of-a-kind invasion is taking place", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_360_News_0>The Koreans are crash-landing on us — and it is not just on Netflix. While the Korean cultural wave or Hallyu has swept India, with K-drama and K-pop grabbing eyeballs and earphones, the K-presence is pervasive, straddling culture and business, with its brands continuing to capture consumers in many segments, including automobiles and consumer durables. When you watch Crash Landing on You on a Samsung phone or listen to BTS in a Kia Sonet, you are, without quite knowing, caught in a one-of-akind Korean invasion. While Korean brands continue to rule the consumer durables sector in India, they are keeping the momentum in the highly volatile automobile industry. New launches, better technology and competitive pricing have played a big part in shaping consumer preferences for Korean products in cars, home appliances and mobile phones. The Indian car market has long been dominated by Japanese brands, but there are visible dents in that fort. While Maruti Suzuki is still leading the auto race, the share of Japanese brands in the Indian market fell from 60% in Q1 of CY 2020 to 48% in Q2 of CY 2022, according to data shared by research firm Jato Dynamics. Meanwhile, the Koreans are refusing to budge from their No. 2 position and have managed to maintain their market share at about 22% in 2020, 2021 and in Q2 of 2022. In Q1 of 2016 their share was 17%. Revamped SUV portfolio and electric vehicles have helped Koreans hold on to their market share despite aggressive product interventions from Indian OEMs like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra.AUTO MOTIF “The Japanese brands are still coveted and better recognised in consumer durables and auto. Yet, the Koreans have managed to introduce the latest tailor-made products that sync with the Indian consumer and have made a headway in the premium-end category,” says advertising and marketing professional Santosh Desai. Ravi Bhatia, president of Jato Dynamics, says, “Korean and Indian auto OEMs have understood the game better.” Despite being late entrants, carmakers from Korea have found a sweet spot in India on the back of technologically superior products. Experts say the fit and finesse of Korean products are the key reasons why they have been gamechangers. “Korean car makers have managed to crack the UV code. Customer preference for SUVs has been steadily increasing, and the Koreans (Hyundai and Kia) lead this market segment,” adds Bhatia. Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director at Maruti Suzuki, says although the Koreans came in late, they are challengers in the game. The Japanese, he says, are more conservative in decision-making. “If Suzuki products factor in affordability, Honda is the leader in mid-size cars, and Toyota leads the MPV (multipurpose vehicle) segment,” says Srivastava about the Japanese brands. In the face of stiff competition, the Japanese brands are trying to claw back its market share. Toyota has plans for 2022. Says Atul Sood, associate vice-president, sales and strategic marketing, Toyota Kirloskar Motor: “The Japanese auto major will provide more options for its customers by expanding the product line-up in a phased manner.” With its global alliance with Suzuki and a “special focus on tier-2 and -3 markets, growth is expected with an enhanced product portfolio, catering to more segments as well as newer markets in 2022,” adds Sood. Honda, too, says it is on a recovery path after some tough years. During Q1 of FY 2023, Honda Cars India’s domestic sales grew by 51% and exports grew by 151%. “However, the supply side challenges have affected our production and despatches since last year leading to longer waiting periods,” says Yuichi Murata, director, marketing and sales, Honda Cars India. The Japanese major has been prioritising the production of fast-selling models and variants such as City and Amaze and adopting new electrified technologies like in the Honda City eHEV, says Murata. Meanwhile, Nissan, which pulled the plug on Datsun in India in April, nine years after its global relaunch, had to discontinue three other cars, owing to strict BS6 emission norms. Ambi Parameswaran, an ad industry veteran and founder of Brand-Building.com, says, “India is a tough auto market. The playbook of the Koreans is to copy me-too products, become innovators by improving on quality and move up the value chain.” The Korean companies’ edgy styling and design philosophy have set their cars apart, say experts. In fact, Korean auto major Hyundai restructured the SUV landscape in India with the launch of Creta in 2015 and became the second-largest passenger vehicle maker in the country. Along with its attractive line-up, Hyundai even had Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan as brand ambassador, which struck a chord with Indian consumers. “Our quest is to be the most trusted brand for reliability, safety and quality. What has also really worked for us is the design philosophy, which has been appealing and very progressive,\" says Tarun Garg, director, sales & marketing, Hyundai Motor India. Kia’s focus on local product development, its design, which incorporates Indiaspecific requirements, and the variant mix at any given price point have worked well with customers. It has also made ownership easy by developing a wide sales network with 339 customer touchpoints, the largest among the new entrants. Kia recently launched the EV6, its first premium electric vehicle in India. “Even before we unveiled its price, the bookings were 3.5 times more than the planned numbers for 2022. This shows the faith of Indian customers in the Kia brand,” says Myung-sik Sohn, chief sales officer, Kia India. The Korean auto major, which made its India entry in August 2019, retails Seltos, Sonet, Carnival and Carens. As the youngest disruptor in the mid-SUV and compact-SUV segments with Seltos and Sonet, Kia has managed to gain a significant market share— 6.7% in H1 2022—in a very short span. Meanwhile, it has been a dream run for Indian automakers like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. Homegrown companies have seen their market share grow from 10% in Q1 of 2020 to 23% in Q2 of 2022. Says Veejay Nakra, president, automotive division, Mahindra & Mahindra: “We have focussed on designing and engineering authentic SUVs by redefining the category and the segments. We have a strong pipeline of bookings (1,70,000+ open bookings across our portfolio).\" Shailesh Chandra, MD of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, cannot emphasise enough the strong comeback it made in FY21, reclaiming its third position and being a challenger brand. “We are leading the EV market and we expect to play a dominant role here,\" he says.DOUBLE FUN For Koreans, it is a twin play — on the cultural and consumer fronts — and they seem to be having a blast. While the K-pop fandom seems to be growing for BTS, Blackpink and Seventeen, the viewership for K-drama on Netflix India increased by more than 370% in 2020 over 2019. \\The Korean survival drama Squid Game trended in the No. 1 spot in India for 11 weeks and featured in the Top 10 for 28 weeks since its release in September 2021. In Spotify's K-pop's global following footprint, which shows where people are listening, India ranked the highest at 68.1 million views in January 2021, followed by Thailand at 39.8 million views, among the target group in the age bracket of 14-18 years. Zee’s English Cluster of channels were quick in recognising the trend and offered K-dramas with English subtitles. “We started with three shows on our list — Descendants of the Sun, Boys Over Flowers, and Bread, Love and Dreams — but fan requests inspired us to curate a special property, Hallyu Nights, on Zee Café,\" says Amit Shah, chief cluster officer, Zee Entertainment Enterprises. \"We also have more shows on our list and are working on acquiring new ones. Zee Café is the only English GEC in India to telecast K-dramas in their original language. Korean content is contributing considerably to the rise in viewership, particularly on our HD feed,\" he adds. Korean drama seems to be whetting the appetite for Korean cuisine, too, with bulgogi and kimbab becoming popular in metros. “The increasing popularity of Korean food has come from watching K-dramas,\" agrees Jinbum Kim, founder of Gung the Palace, a Korean restaurant in Delhi. \"The spicy flavour of Korean food appeals to Indians.” This is unlike the trajectory of Japanese cuisine in India, says Amit Chowdhury, executive chef of The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai, which has the popular Wasabi restaurant. “Japanese cuisine has not gone beyond sushi and teppanyaki. As the ingredients are expensive, it does not appeal to the masses as yet,” he says.WINNING THE CONSUMER Long before India learnt of BTS singer Jungkook or took a fascination for bulgogi, there was a Korean wave in the consumer durables sector — and it is still going strong. LG Electronics has been the market leader in the home appliances segment in India for over a decade, and the company says it has strengthened its position. In most home appliances categories such as washing machines, refrigerators and microwave ovens, LG India says it has over 30% market share, quoting market researcher GfK India. The cumulative market share in January-May for LG has been 35.6% in washing machines, 31% in refrigerators and 42.5% in microwave ovens. Another Korean giant, Samsung, dominates the television market in the country. It is also the largest mobile phone maker by sales and the second largest in smartphones by units sold. LG and Samsung control 55- 60% of the market of most home appliances. Deepak Bansal, vice-president (home appliances) at LG India, says, “The key to our success has been our vision to launch India-insight products to enhance consumers' lifestyle. Another focus area has been investment in premium product portfolios. <IMG Economictime_PL_360_News_1>For instance, LG was the first brand to shift its entire AC line-up to inverter technology. In 2022, till June, we sold 1 million dual-inverter ACs, the highest for any brand. Also, LG has strengthened its market leadership in side-by-side refrigerators (55.5% share) and front-loading washing machines (38% share).” The Chinese appliance brand Haier is fast gaining market share to become third after the Korean duo. Even a decade back, the landscape was different when Videocon was a dominant player. Now, the only sizable Indian manufacturers are Tata-owned Voltas, Godrej Appliances and Havellsowned Lloyd. Voltas has been able to challenge LG in air conditioners and become the market leader. Lloyd has the third largest share in air conditioners, thanks to its focus on mid-segment and aggressive pricing. Voltas MD Pradeep Bakshi says the company sold close to 1.2 million AC units till June of this calendar year — the highest ever by any player in the industry. “We have significant penetration in tier-2, -3, and -4 markets,” says Bakshi.In smartphones, Samsung is snapping at the heels of Xiaomi on the number of units sold in India. As per the latest data for April-June by market tracker Counterpoint Research, Samsung now has an 18.6% share, while Xiaomi is just marginally ahead at 19.2%. A year back, Xiaomi had a 28% share and Samsung 18%. While Xiaomi lost share due to component shortage and increased competition, Counterpoint says Samsung has become the top-seller in 5G smartphones and in the Rs 30,000-plus premium segment, wresting control from Apple. <IMG Economictime_PL_360_News_2>It has gained by revamping its portfolio and launching financing schemes in smaller towns. Even the Covid pandemic, which saw several smaller brands pull out of the market or lose market share due to cash flow crisis in the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, has not been able to spoil the Korean tactics. Industry executives say that in the last two years, LG and Samsung have gained market share by 1-3 percentage points across home appliances due to their deep pockets and marketing muscles. It is a game the Koreans are playing to win.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/the-korean-wave-from-samsung-to-jungkook-a-one-of-a-kind-invasion-is-taking-place/articleshow/93240219.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_360_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The Korean wave is pervasive, sweeping across cars, consumer durables and popular culture.", "id": "Economictime_PL_360_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-93240333,width-300,imgsize-2130218,,resizemode-4,quality-100/the-korean-wave-is-pervasive-sweeping-across-cars-consumer-durables-and-popular-culture-.jpg"}, {"caption": "Country of origin", "id": "Economictime_PL_360_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93240372,quality-100/country-of-origin.jpg"}, {"caption": "Gadgets", "id": "Economictime_PL_360_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93240392,quality-100/gadgets.jpg"}]}

In fact, seven of the top 10 brands are owned by homegrown companies.The Brand Footprint study ranks brands on the basis of their consumer reach points, or CRPs, a composite metric that combines how many households are buying a brand (penetration) and how often (frequency of purchase). \"Growth is largely driven by food brands since the frequency of essentials such as milk are significantly higher. Big brands continue to do well and inflation is expected to grow CRPs even further,\" said K Ramakrishnan, managing director, South Asia, Kantar Worldpanel.Nearly 70% of the brands grew CRPs last year. \"As a result, CRP grew just 9% now compared to 3% growth a year ago,\" Ramakrishnan added.Out of nearly 400 brands, Parle with 6531 million CRP has been on the top since the launch of its brand footprint a decade ago followed by dairy brand Amul that had CRP of 5561 million. Both these brands gained 14% and 9% each. Hindustan Unilever's shampoo brand Clinic Plus was the only non-food exception in the top five brands. HUL's Vim also topped the rankings for the brand which gained the most shoppers followed by Balaji Wafers.

Speaking at the launch event here, Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya noted that the schemes envisage technology upgradation, setting up of common research centres and effluent treatment plants in clusters for the pharma MSMEs.  Small companies should be able to upgrade their facilities to global manufacturing standards, he said.  The chemicals and fertilisers ministry rolled out the schemes under the banner of 'Strengthening Pharmaceuticals Industry' (SPI).  \"I believe the pharma MSME industry will greatly benefit from the schemes. The new schemes have many benefits that will go a long way in making the Indian pharmaceutical industry Atmanirbhar, more resilient and future-ready,\" Mandaviya, who heads both health as well as chemical and fertilisers ministries, said. The Pharmaceutical Technology Upgradation Assistance Scheme (PTUAS) would facilitate pharmaceutical MSMEs with proven track record to upgrade their technology.  The scheme has provisions for a capital subsidy of 10 per cent on loans up to a maximum limit of Rs 10 crore with a minimum repayment period of three years or interest subvention of up to 5 per cent (6 per cent in case of units owned by SC/ST) on reducing balance basis.  <IMG Economictime_PL_376_News_1> Similarly, Assistance to Pharma Industries for Common Facilities Scheme (API-CF) would strengthen the existing pharmaceutical clusters' capacity for sustained growth.  It provides for an assistance of up to 70 per cent of the approved project cost or Rs 20 crore, whichever is less.  In case of Himalayan and north-east region, the grant-in-aid would be Rs 20 crore per cluster or 90 per cent of the project cost, whichever is less.  Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Promotion and Development Scheme (PMPDS) would involve preparation of study reports on topics of importance for the Indian pharma and medical device industry.  The scheme is aimed at creating a database of pharma and medical device sectors.  Mandaviya asked the industry to keep upgrading in order to cater to evolving requirements across global markets.  He said that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is working relentlessly towards strengthening the pharma industry.  \"It (schemes) will increase investment, encourage research and innovation and enable the industry to develop futuristic products and ideas,\" the minister said.  The minister said the government is working to enhance ease of doing business and also reduce compliances to help the industry grow at a rapid pace.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/govt-launches-three-schemes-for-pharma-sector-msmes/articleshow/93029497.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_376_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Mandaviya asked the industry to keep upgrading in order to cater to evolving requirements across global markets.", "id": "Economictime_PL_376_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-93029624,width-300,imgsize-99000,,resizemode-4,quality-100/pharmz-.jpg"}, {"caption": "mansukh mandaviya.", "id": "Economictime_PL_376_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93049618,quality-100/mansukh-mandaviya-.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Axilor launches second fund of $100-million", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_389_News_0>Early-stage investor Axilor Ventures is launching its second technology fund - Axilor Technology Fund - II (ATF-II) - worth $100 million to double down on its investments in Indian startups while continuing its focus on seed opportunities. ATF-II is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), and expects to close by September-end. This comes as the eight-year-old fund - founded by former Infosys cofounders Kris Gopalakrishnan and SD Shibulal, along with other senior technologists - has deployed 90% of its first fund (ATF-I) worth Rs 200 crore by backing almost 54 companies. Axilor’s new fund comes at a time when overall funding in Indian startups has dipped to $6.9 billion in the April to June period compared with $11 billion in the previous quarter. Further, global macroeconomic headwinds continue to hurt the investments and valuations of technology companies. However, as late-stage investors take a cautionary approach towards investments and growth-stage funds continue to park capital for their existing portfolio, early-stage investments have come forth as the sweet spot, as top-tier Indian venture capital (VC) firms rush to back startups early.  <IMG Economictime_PL_389_News_1>ET reported on July 5, that though funding for early-stage startups dipped marginally to $839 million in the April-June period, it continues to be 30% higher than the last quarter of 2021.Axilor’s latest corpus is almost four-fold higher than its previous close, as the seed-backer looks to continue backing startups in areas of enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) working on specific vertical specialisations and supply-chain technologies, fintech, healthcare, and agritech. It looks to deploy a large part of the latest fund towards business-to-business (B2B) software providers building for India and global markets.Other cofounders in the fund include Tarun Khanna, Srinath Batni, and Ganapathy Venugopal.“The first fund was about finding the product-market fit for us, where we were actively looking at business models and founders that aligned with our investment thesis. Now, for the next five years, we are seeing a $1-trillion digitisation opportunity,” said Venugopal, chief executive of Axilor Ventures. On increasing the fund corpus, he said: “We are seeing global enterprise SaaS companies being built out of India, going after large global verticals such as BFSI, auto, steel. So these are interesting opportunities to build out $100-million ARR (annual run rate) companies.”The deployment period of the new fund is expected to be over 12 years, as the seed-backer looks to recycle the capital through returns and exits, Venugopal added. “Almost 30% of the new fund will be allocated to support cross-over opportunities and portfolio companies from the previous funds,” he said.However, the fund will continue its pace to back 10-12 companies every year, writing initial seed cheques between $750,000 to $1 million, and acquiring an average 10-12% stake in early-stage startups. Based on the performance, it will also look to write follow-on cheques worth $2-$3 million. Axilor expects to back 100-125 new companies, with its second technology fund.<IMG Economictime_PL_389_News_2> With the first fund, Axilor’s current portfolio includes restaurant-management platform UrbanPiper, which recently got the backing of Indian foodtech majors Swiggy and Zomato; digital-entertainment startup, PocketAces; fintechs Enkash and Vyapar and breast cancer screening solution Niramai. Also, Axilor’s latest fundraise comes when several early-stage funds, including Elevation Capital, Athera Venture Partners (formerly Inventus Capital), and Accel, among others, have closed their latest funds and increased their corpus on the back of a record-breaking year for funding in Indian startups.“The seed-to-Series A conversion is the hardest. While for the ecosystem, it is 18%, for Axilor, it is trending at 48%. Most tier-I funds have accelerated their fund allocation towards seed-to-early-stage opportunities. However, how the deployment progresses (for tier-I funds) will largely depend on how many of their portfolio companies move from seed to Series A and growth stages,” Venugopal commented on the increased competition among the early-stage backers. Other VCs, too, have raised the ceiling for seed-stage investments in the recent past.Sequoia - which announced its mega $2.85-billion India and Southeast Asia fund in June - has decided to raise the ceiling to $3 million for its accelerator programme Surge, and Tiger Global has also started backing India’s early-stage startups.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/axilor-launches-new-100-million-second-technology-fund/articleshow/92695640.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_389_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Ganapathy Venugopal, cofounder & CEO at Axilor Ventures", "id": "Economictime_PL_389_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-92695868,width-650,imgsize-19722,,resizemode-4,quality-100/ganapathy-venugopal-co-founder-ceo-at-axilor-ventures.jpg"}, {"caption": "early stage", "id": "Economictime_PL_389_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-92695704,quality-100/early-stage.jpg"}, {"caption": "Axilor’s second fund", "id": "Economictime_PL_389_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-92720624,quality-100/axilors-second-fund.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Maruti Suzuki ups the SUV game with the launch of Grand Vitara", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_393_News_0>The launch of Grand Vitara is expected to strengthen Maruti Suzuki India’s position in the fast growing high-ticket sports utility vehicles (SUV) segment thereby improving visibility of the company’s sales volume.The share of passenger vehicles (PV) with a price tag of Rs 15 lakh and above rose to 15% in 2022, compared with 2% in FY18. The recent model launches by India’s largest car maker shows that it is keen to address the changing consumer expectations by incorporating new features at par with peers while shedding its age-old image of an affordable car maker.The mid-SUV segment grew by 8% annually over the past five years compared with 1% growth for the total PV segment. Maruti Suzuki’s exposure to the mid-SUV bracket has so far been limited even as some of the peers boast of waiting periods of 3-9 months for their respective models.However, with the new product launches Maruti is likely to cover the ground faster since past experience shows that feature rich products at attractive introductory prices become popular. For instance, Maruti’s Baleno and Brezza models added about 10-20% of incremental volume after the launch. The latest SUV launches are expected to appeal to a significant base of Maruti customers beyond the metro regions which are willing to upgrade.<IMG Economictime_PL_393_News_1>Maruti has over 3,000 retail outlets across the country. It derives nearly 43% of total sales from non-metros cities. It plans to produce around one lakh Vitara in the current fiscal year.Vitara will be manufactured at Toyota’s plant at Bidadi near Bengaluru. Maruti Suzuki and Toyota plan to produce 18,000-19,000 units a month of the new jointly developed SUV. Of this, Maruti Suzuki plans to sell about 13,000 units a month, while the remaining will be sold by Toyota under the badge of Hyryder. This has a cumulative revenue potential of Rs 2,500-3,000 crore per month.Maruti has also focussed on fuel efficiency, a factor which is conventionally associated with low-cost models but now gaining importance in the mid-SUV segment as well. It is one of the major reasons for Toyota’s Hyryder to attract higher bookings for the strong hybrid variant.With the mild hybrid version, Vitara’s mileage will be around 21 kilometers per litre (kmpl). In the case of the strong hybrid version, it could reach nearly 28 kmpl—one of the highest in the category.Maruti’s stock has outperformed the S&P BSE Sensex by 20% since the beginning of the year. At Monday’s closing price of Rs 8.613.3 on the BSE, it was traded at 23 times one year forward earnings, a premium of 5% over the long-term average valuation.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/cars-uvs/maruti-suzuki-ups-the-suv-game-with-the-launch-of-grand-vitara/articleshow/93113850.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_393_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Vitara will be manufactured at Toyota’s plant at Bidadi near Bengaluru.", "id": "Economictime_PL_393_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-93113839,width-300,imgsize-100172,,resizemode-4,quality-100/maruti-suzuki-ups-the-suv-game-with-the-launch-of-grand-vitara.jpg"}, {"caption": "Maruti Looks to Strengthen SUV Share with Grand Vitara Launch", "id": "Economictime_PL_393_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93123336,quality-100/maruti-looks-to-strengthen-suv-share-with-grand-vitara-launch.jpg"}]}

For that, as an industry, we need to have a long-term vision, and the government has done a lot to encourage the PLI scheme.” <IMG Economictime_PL_405_News_1>Ola’s ambitious electric-car project will see it building a new manufacturing facility next to its two-wheeler factory in Tamil Nadu.Ola plans to debut its four-wheeler EV by the summer of 2024 and claims its car will have the ability to go from 0-100 km/hour in four seconds and a range of more than 500 km per charge. The company’s maiden car will be a \"premium\" offering and the \"fastest and sportiest car\" India has ever seen, Aggarwal said.It aims to manufacture 1 million cars a year by 2026.ET reported on August 13 that the company was looking to hire about 3,000 people for the car project. Ola is closing in on 1,000 hires, the CEO said on Monday.Ola said on July 18 that it would be investing about $500 million in a battery cell research and development facility in Bengaluru. The company's vision is to produce vehicles priced from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, starting with its electric scooters.The new scooter variant, Ola S1 with a claimed range of 141 kms, will be available at an introductory price of Rs 99,999. The launch of the cheaper variant comes at a time when sales have slowed for its S1 Pro scooter, as ET reported on June 24.Ride-hailing is profitableThe announcement comes on the back of layoffs at Ola’s ride-hailing business, as reported by ET on July 29.Ola has been increasingly focussing on its EV initiatives even as many key employees from its core ride-hailing business have been moved to work at Ola Electric.“Both are very different businesses. Ola is a ride-sharing company, we are leaders in India, we are doing very well in India, we are very profitable, it is a very well-run business. We have professional teams running the company … We will share in a couple of months strategies about the ride-hailing,” Aggarwal told ET on Monday.He said there was some fungibility of people between the two companies.When asked about reports about Ola's merger with rival Uber in India, Aggarwal reiterated his earlier statement: \"I will never acquire a loss-making business.”Falling sales, fire incidentsWhile talking of the it’s scooters catching fire and how it impacted sales, Aggarwal said: “We have always said from day one that India should be a global leader when it comes to safety norms. We already have a decent, fairly good safety structure, and architecture in terms of testing … Government wants to evolve that and we support that fully and we have shared our thoughts with the government and the different panels on how it can be evolved to world standards.”Ola Electric’s chief marketing officer, Anshul Khandelwal, said the decline in sales was due to \"seasonal and cyclical factors\" that affected the entire industry.Reservations for early access to the new Ola S1 variant began Monday for Rs 499. Ola also plans to release MoveOS 3, an update of its operating system, this Diwali.Aggarwal said more than 75% of customers get their service needs addressed in one day.The CEO said the two-wheeler unit was on track to achieving profitability in \"a few quarters\". It will also launch more products to ensure demand does not fall.Aggarwal said its public charging network, called Hyperchargers, was yet to become operational.The company claimed last year that it would set up the largest charging network and install 5,000 charging points by the end of the year. But Aggarwal said the company decided against it as customers preferred home charging.\"As of now it (Hypercharger network) is not operational,\" he said. \"Because we also learnt after we launched that charging may not be as big of a challenge to consumers as we hoped earlier. We prioritised our energies in scaling our service network.\"", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/ola-to-launch-first-electric-car-by-2024-introduces-new-s1-scooters/articleshow/93572650.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_405_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Bhavish Aggarwal unveils Ola electric car with 500 km range.", "id": "Economictime_PL_405_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-93575464,width-650,imgsize-18482,,resizemode-4,quality-100/ola-electric-to-produce-evs-in-india-by-2024.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ola's newly launched S1 range", "id": "Economictime_PL_405_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93581031,quality-100/olas-newly-launched-s1-range.jpg"}]}

For a one-point share loss, one must spend three times more to gain it back,\" said Sam Balsara, chairman of Madison World, who expects the ad industry to grow 20% in 2022.\"So, it is critical and necessary to support brands and companies despite inflation and companies that reduced ad-to-sales ratio have historically suffered from a slower growth rate compared to those that kept investing,\" he said.Shashank Srivastava, senior ED, sales and marketing at Maruti Suzuki said despite the long waiting period, there is no slowing down on engaging with the customers through advertising and marketing.\"The spends for automotive advertising is set to grow by double-digits and cross ₹7,500 crore for the industry, with carmakers contributing almost half of it. The spends on high decibal new launches, sustenance of brands already selling in the market place and ground level activation to drive conversion of interest into sales, is leading to higher spends,\" added Srivastava. Several companies said they would protect margins by curtailing other expenditures when record high inflation is squeezing margins. Several companies have also started to pass input price hikes to consumers via price hikes or decreased pack sizes or both.\"Just because of severe commodity inflation, there will be margin pressure, but we will continue to invest for growth. What we will also see is upfront marketing investments for a lot of category development initiatives,\" Sameer Shah, chief financial officer at Godrej Consumer Products told investors. Colgate India, too, said margin is not a function of higher pricing and it will not pull out advertising but keep it at a competitive level. Most companies had significantly cut down on marketing spends in 2020-21 due to the onset of the Covid pandemic and lockdowns, though some sectors like FMCG and consumer electronics revived it in 2021-22 buoyed by a recovery in consumer sentiments. India's largest consumer goods maker with a large advertising budget, Hindustan Unilever CEO Sanjiv Mehta last month told analysts the company will grow market development at a pace faster than the rest of the market and will not shy from investing in it through advertising. Mehta said in \"this kind of volatile hyperinflation environment,\" growing consumer franchise and protecting HUL's business model are the two big imperatives. \"But we play for the long term. And we will not do anything that could in any way hurt our business from the long term perspective,\" he said.Modern retail, apparel and restaurant businesses have recovered sales significantly in the last two quarters reaching to pre-Covid levels and companies have said the outlook is bullish for the next few months.Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail managing director Ashish Dixit told analysts that advertising investments will need to go significantly higher from where it had come down to in FY21 and FY22 when it had to take deep cuts on that and that will come back to the pre-pandemic levels.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/top-consumer-companies-plan-to-step-up-advertising-spends-despite-high-inflation/articleshow/91926772.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_412_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_412_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-91926903,width-300,imgsize-71924,,resizemode-4,quality-100/fmcg-.jpg"}, {"caption": "ads", "id": "Economictime_PL_412_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-91926904,quality-100/ads.jpg"}]}
{"title": "InnoDesigns: Furniture-maker carves out products at the click of a button", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_424_News_0>The idea of InnoDesigns was born when Nidhey A Pan was getting his new home furnished. He realised that there were many gaps — from quality assurance to price — in the online furniture market. The biggest problem he faced was the lack of bespoke furniture services online. This encouraged him to set up InnoDesigns in 2021. A part of PAN Group, a multi-interest business group from Rajkot, the company is looking to personalise the furniture industry through an ecommerce platform. It eases the customer experience irrespective of whether the products are readymade or custom-made.Although the furniture industry is largely an unorganised sector, there are players who are offering a variety of products and limited customisation services. InnoDesigns, however, claims to be the first company to offer 100% customisation in just a click at a competitive price. The founder and CEO of InnoDesign, Pan (30), says, “We aspire to be the one stop shop that offers 100% online customisation of furniture items, with respect to fabric, colour and wood options. We have readymade and custom-made options for consumers and deliver colour swatches on request to their homes. This makes the entire shopping experience more comfortable.\" Helping local artisansIn a fast-paced lifestyle, everyone is looking for services that saves time, is convenient and reliable. Due to a rise in disposable income, there is demand for affordable, dependable, go-to stores offering custom-made home requirements. InnoDesign vouches for this because its website, launched in November last year, has been getting “an average of 2,000 hits a day”. <IMG Economictime_PL_424_News_1>Pan says, “The company’s motto is ‘reflecting your dream space’. This is in line with our aim to empower our customers to be able to build their own dream space in their home. The concept of 100% online customisation is a new idea that people will gradually understand, explore, accept and utilise. We realise that there is a demand for the premium services that we are offering. People are understanding that a home is just an extension of their personality. We aim to become a part of the personal journey of a customer while designing their dream home, enabling them to visualise their thoughts. People are also more willing to pay a premium for a customised product, which is a reflection of their choices. Hence, our major challenge is to communicate to our customers about the kind of brand we are, and the kind of services we offer.”The company has got local artisans on board so that they can sell directly to the customer. What makes them different from other players in the furniture market is that they manufacture every product on request. A customer from Kochi, Joyson K (55), who owns a gym, says he became interested in InnoDesigns solely because of their online customisation services. “I am fond of redecorating my home, and often design the interior spaces myself. This requires me to spend some time with carpenters. So I was eager to try out InnoDesigns. I found the designs on their website unique. I was satisfied with the overall conduct of the staff and the services offered.”  Vocal for LocalThe company has been built on the concepts of Make in India and “Vocal for Local”. All InnoDesigns products are sourced from local manufacturers to help them reach more customers online. As the products undergo quality checks by InnoDesigns — delivery, installation and other logistics are handled by InnoDesigns — it helps the local manufacturers up their game by getting professional advice.Subin Phillip (35) used InnoDesign’s services for his house in Kochi and says the company offered the best prices for his requirements. “I was looking to furnish my new home, including the living room, dining room and bedrooms. After comparing prices from local shops and other online marketplaces, I found InnoDesigns the best prices in all departments. The kind of prices they charge for solid teak and mahogany furniture was quite unbelievable to me, and they also offered online customisation. I ordered all my furniture from InnoDesigns and am quite happy with the services,” says the IT sector employee.InnoDesigns wants to become a household name for furniture solutions. It also wants to give a boost to its vendors along the way. “As we are an aggregator and rely on local manufacturers to supply the actual products, we also hope to uplift the carpenter community through greater sales, reach and recognition for their work,” Pan adds.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/entrepreneurship/innodesign-is-set-to-personalise-the-online-furniture-buying-experience/articleshow/92534736.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_424_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The company has been built on the concepts of Make in India and 'Vocal for Local'.", "id": "Economictime_PL_424_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-92535120,width-650,imgsize-101900,,resizemode-4,quality-100/istock-1167010431.jpg"}, {"caption": "Nidhey Pan Innodesign", "id": "Economictime_PL_424_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-92534745,quality-100/nidhey-pan-innodesign.jpg"}]}

At Vedanta-Foxconn's first semiconductor plant launch, Anil Agarwal says Gen Z will turn job creators", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_427_News_0>The launch of Vedanta-Foxconn's first semiconductor plant in Gujarat on Tuesday kept Anil Agarwal anxious and excited at the same time.In a lengthy post on LinkedIn, the Chairman of Vedanta Resources Limited revealed that he stayed wide awake during his flight as his decade-long dream was coming true. \"I usually sleep like a baby on flights but this time, my eyes were wide awake,\" he said. After working on his dream project for nearly 10 years, he was excited to see India get a step closer to its own 'Silicon Valley'.The mining conglomerate and Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn invested Rs 1.54 lakh crore in setting up India's first semiconductor plant in Gujarat on Tuesday.As part of the 60:40 joint venture, Vedanta-Foxconn will set up a semiconductor fab unit, a display fab unit, and a semiconductor assembling and testing unit on a 1000-acre land in the Ahmedabad district.\"I am proud to share with you all that we are making one of the biggest investments in the heart of high-tech India worth Rs 1.54 lakh crore! Our team at Vedanta will be setting up the country's first-ever semiconductor and display glass plant in Gujarat,\" he shared.For the past few years, the world has been experiencing a massive semiconductor chips (also known as microchips) shortage, affecting several industries such as electronics and automotive. These chipsets power essential digital consumer products such as cars, mobile phones, ATM cards, televisions, laptops, automobiles and air-conditioners, among other things. Valued at $27.2 billion in 2021, the Indian semiconductor market is expected to grow at a healthy compound annual growth rate of nearly 19 per cent to reach $64 billion in 2026. However, none of these chips were manufactured in India so far.\"A lot of you may already know what semiconductors are. I like to think of them as the brain of our electronics...

{"title": "ETtech Explainer: Will India’s space policy launch startups into orbit?", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_438_News_0>During the 1960s, India’s space programme was seen as a white elephant by many. It was a turbulent decade in India’s history as the two wars with China and Pakistan had drained the country’s coffers. But within two decades, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched its first experimental satellite vehicle, called Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3). This made India the sixth nation to launch its own satellite into space. Then in 1993, ISRO joined an elite list of six space organisations that have sent an orbiter to the moon. In 2017, the Indian Department of Space (DOS) released the Draft Space Activities Bill, which set regulations and goals for the private space industry, after several startups expressed interest in space activities called for regulations.Three years later, on June 26, 2020, the government announced that private enterprises would be allowed to participate across all phases of space activities.Then in June 2022, Principal Scientific Advisor Ajay Kumar Sood told PTI in an interview that the government was finalising the Space Policy 2022 and would unveil it soon. “We have not tapped the full potential of this sector. In 2022, the space sector is witnessing what the information technology sector experienced in the 1990s. We will have our own SpaceX in the next two years,” he said. <IMG Economictime_PL_438_News_1>The global commercial space sector is worth $360 billion. At $7 billion, India's share works out to around 2%. By boosting private participation in the commercial space sector, the country is looking to substantially increase this to $50 billion or 10% by the end of the decade.What are IN-SPACe and ISpA?In 2020, the government announced the formation of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) and the Indian Space Association (ISpA). IN-SPACe will administer the involvement of private players in the Indian space sector, giving ISRO time and resources to focus on spatial research & development, technology innovation, exploration, and human spaceflight.ISpA on the other hand will help private players conduct independent space activities, and ease services. The private sector will use technology developed by ISRO, which will also provide regulatory and policy inputs to the sector, along with support for startups and space-oriented academia.How will private firms improve India's space programme? Apart from space missions, ISRO’s resources are occupied with the increasing need for satellite data and imagery for weather, agriculture, transport and urban development. If private firms take charge of the commercial side of the space programme, ISRO ill be able to use all its resources for research and development, interplanetary exploration, and strategic launches.“With the opening up of the space sector, there could be dedicated satellites for various sectors such as agriculture, education, disaster management, ecommerce applications,” Sood said.Companies are champing at the bitSince the opening up of the space sector to private sector players two years ago, more than 55 startups have registered with ISRO and the Department of Space, Union Minister of State For Science and Technology Jitendra Singh said. India has more than 100 spacetech startups in total. Of the 55 proposals received by ISRO, 29 are satellite-related, while 10 are for space applications and products, Singh said.Consortiums led by Adani Group and L&T and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) have signed up to build five launch vehicles. <IMG Economictime_PL_438_News_2>Anil Prakash, director general of SatCom Industry Association of India (SIA-India), an industry body, said the upcoming space policy would define the transfer of technology regulations, enabling private startups to use existing ISRO’s infrastructure and build on it. This would streamline both costs and deployment time, allowing startups to scale, he added.Some have taken their first stepsIn June, ISRO’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C53 created history by carrying payloads from two private Indian space startups to orbit in India’s first official public-private collaboration in the space sector.Bengaluru-based Digantara Aerospace and Hyderabad-headquartered Dhruva Space recently launched a rocket carrying Digantara’s ROBust Integrating (ROBI) proton fluence meter and Dhruva Space’s satellite orbital deployer on the (PSLV)-C53 mission. Digantara’s ROBI is not only the world’s first commercial space-based weather system but also the smallest, the company claimed. Dhruva Space meanwhile, developed satellite deployment systems that are compatible with ISRO’s PSLV launch vehicles – one of the most important aspects of satellite deployment. What are the challenges?Though the government has taken steps to boost private-sector participation in space, my companies have said the large number of approvals required remains a huge barrier. According to the Indian Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), in 2017, Hughes, a US-based company, announced a $500 million satellite communications system in India. To date, the company has not received any approvals or an expected timeline.Another challenge is the lack of clear, specific, and streamlined regulations. <IMG Economictime_PL_438_News_3>Long way to goOver the past two decades, private companies such as Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Arianespace have revolutionised the space sector by reducing costs and turnaround times. However, in India, private enterprises are limited to being mere suppliers to the government’s space programme.Though private startups such as Agnikul Cosmos, Skyroot Aerospace, Pixxel, and Dhruva Space are all expected to launch their respective missions this year, India is still at a nascent stage in the private space race, well behind other nations.The government and private firms are hoping the Space Policy 2022 will succeed in bridging this gap.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/ettech-explainer-will-indias-space-policy-launch-startups-into-orbit/articleshow/93003501.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_438_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_438_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-93003896,width-650,imgsize-94100,,resizemode-4,quality-100/space.jpg"}, {"caption": "Global space economy", "id": "Economictime_PL_438_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93003726,quality-100/global-space-economy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Steps taken up", "id": "Economictime_PL_438_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93003595,quality-100/steps-taken-up.jpg"}, {"caption": "India’s budget for space sector applications", "id": "Economictime_PL_438_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-93003762,quality-100/indias-budget-for-space-sector-applications.jpg"}]}

The company launched a string of products, aimed at empowering the next phase of digital growth for small businesses in India. It believes these milestones are a testament to the fintech adoption the country has witnessed in the last two years. These were launched at the fourth edition of FTX, Razorpay’s Fintech Conference that brought together 100 speakers and was virtually attended by 20,000 fintech enthusiasts from across the globe.India is the fastest growing fintech market in the world, with the highest adoption rate of 87% in the world against the global average of 64%. And through the last few months of this adoption, India’s small businesses have evolved from understanding the importance of going digital in the post-pandemic world, to now learning how to build an online presence for their business. However, if the country seeks to enhance this adoption rate and achieve the ambition of a $5 trillion economy by 2025, Razorpay believes SMBs need to be given the right technology support, guidance, and resources to re-imagine their business models or accelerate their existing models and have the right strategy.The potential for MSMEs and freelancers also continues to grow in 2022, hence businesses need an intelligent real-time financial infrastructure to scale. Razorpay’s new products will help businesses spend less time managing compliance and operations and more time creating new products.<IMG Economictime_PL_472_News_1>New products: In a statement, Harshil Mathur, CEO & Co-founder said, “We’re living in a world where the pandemic has drastically changed how small businesses manage money.

{"title": "After meteoric rise, Ayurveda products losing momentum", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_511_News_0>Despite leading companies launching hundreds of natural and herbal personal care items, the contribution of ayurvedic products has either remained stagnant or fallen over the past two years of the pandemic, which had been projected to give them a boost.For instance, the contribution of the herbal segment in oral care has remained at 28% for the past two calendar years, said industry executives citing Nielsen. Within hair oils, it's declined to 7.1% from 7.8% in 2020. The share of ayurvedic shampoos has risen marginally from 8.1% to 8.8% in this period.Industry executives attributed this to a few large brands that launched products before the pandemic but lost momentum and consumers shifting to large established ayurvedic or non-ayurvedic brands, compared with smaller ones that had distribution issues during the outbreak.<IMG Economictime_PL_511_News_1>Dabur India CEO Mohit Malhotra, however, said some consumers are increasingly preferring herbal, natural and ayurvedic products for their personal care needs.\"This is evident in the oral care segment, where the ayurvedic and naturals categories have been growing at a much faster pace as compared to the normal white toothpaste,\" he said. Dabur said it has expanded its share in the oral care and hair oil category, including perfumed oil and coconut oil.Nielsen data show the growth rate of ayurvedic toothpaste brands such as Cibaca Vedshakti, Colgate Swarna Vedshakti, Lever Ayush and Himalaya had slowed over 2020-21 with some brands' growth rates declining on a quarter-on-quarter basis. In shampoos, Patanjali's growth rate mostly fell, dragging down the overall category's contribution.The stagnation followed impressive growth during the pre-pandemic years on the back of the meteoric rise of Patanjali and mainstream companies entering the segment to compete with the Ayurveda-based brand.  Going Beyond Established Brands  For instance, ayurvedic oral care contribution surged from 22% to 27% between 2017 and 2019.A 2021 Euromonitor survey showed that about 41% of Indian population took vitamins and supplements for stronger immunity in 2020, rising to 50% in the next year. With heightened interest in such products, consumers explored more ayurvedic formulations that led to companies launching products mainly in the packaged food space in contrast with a few years ago when personal care was their preferred choice of entry into the space.Also, over the past two years, the shift to online shopping helped consumers experiment with new products, going beyond the top, established brands.\"Since we customise the product for every customer profile, it gives us an edge over legacy brands who are still offering generic products,\" said Jatin Gujrati, business head, Vedix, which has launched several ayurvedic products including oils, serums, shampoos and oral care. \"As customers gravitate towards chemical-free products and customised products, D2C (direct-to-consumer) brands will grow faster which is already evident in our repeat purchase data.\"A recent report by HDFC Securities said the ayurvedic trend was largely started by Patanjali and Dabur but is no longer limited to any category or company as D2C trend will disrupt the wide consumer basket, both for consumer non-discretionary and discretionary categories. Industry executives pointed out that market researchers haven't taken D2C brands launched a few years back into account.\"Being D2C gives us the ability to innovate and improve faster than our legacy peers as we are directly listening to our customers,\" said Senthil Kari, vice president at Kerala Ayurveda. \"Our businesses are tech-enabled which gives us the agility to innovate fast and roll out new products.\"In the next five years, essential oils and oral care will corner 5-10% of the market from the legacy brands, he said.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/after-meteoric-rise-ayurveda-products-losing-momentum/articleshow/90870949.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_511_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_511_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-90870982,width-300,imgsize-30848,,resizemode-4,quality-100/goodness-of-ayurveda.jpg"}, {"caption": "herbal", "id": "Economictime_PL_511_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-90870988,quality-100/herbal.jpg"}]}

The brokerage is overweight on these three sectors.For automobiles, Axis Securities said that the sector had witnessed a significant demand improvement with most categories seeing improved traction.“In Q4FY22, auto companies broadly reported better-than-expected results, exhibiting outperformance on the margin front, which was aided by improving product mix, higher realizations, cost control measures, and positive operating leverage led by improving volumes,” the brokerage said, adding that the long-term outlook was positive.New product launches could boost enthusiasm among buyers, with the SUV segment seen retaining consumer pulling power, it said.“Furthermore, the introduction of a duty on steel export may lead to gross margin improvement for Automakers, which is expected to translate into earnings upgrade as most of the companies are likely to retain the benefit.”So far in 2022, the S&P BSE Auto index has climbed 5.6 per cent.Speaking on specialty chemicals, Axis Securities termed it one of the sunrise sectors in India, with the country gaining a global market share in the space by leveraging capabilities. Realignment of supply chains from China to India has also helped the sector.“We believe Indian companies would gain further ground as companies reduce dependence on China after the COVID-19 pandemic and shift their supply chains to India. Apart from the long-term supply chain shift theme, many specialty chemicals form a part of essentials and the facilities have started opening up post-lockdown relaxations,” the brokerage said.While a decline in raw material prices would boost margins and reduce working capital requirements, input costs are a pass-through for most companies and gains may be limited, Axis Securities wrote.Outlining why it is bullish on telecom, Axis Securities said that the sector has emerged as the most critical in the current environment due to its crucial role in keeping businesses up and running. According to the brokerage, the sector had witnessed improved pricing even prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.“The industry is highly consolidated with two strong and one weak player in the wireless space.”The brokerage has an equal weightage on 10 sectors. The sectors are banking and financial services, capital goods, cement, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, information technology, metals and mining, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and real estate. <IMG Economictime_PL_531_News_1>TOP STOCK PICKSThe brokerage selected a total of 16 stocks as top picks within the large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap space.Amid large-caps, Axis Securities favours ,  and .

{"title": "Auto companies slam brakes on Sri Lanka exports, production", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_579_News_0>Mumbai: A severe economic crisis in Sri Lanka has forced many Indian automotive firms to slam the brakes on exports of vehicle kits as well as production at the local assembly operations they have set up in the island nation.Shipments of vehicle kits, including those for light commercial vehicles, trucks and buses, have declined sharply, as the neighbouring country is grappling with precarious forex reserves and fuel shortages, said industry executives.While companies like Tata Motors have been exporting vehicle kits to distributors in Sri Lanka, others such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland and TVS Motors have local assembly operations in the country.“We are unable to get the kits, so we cannot put finished products out in the market,” said Rajeev Pandithage, chief operating officer-mobility sector at Diesel & Motor Engineering, one of the oldest and largest dealers for Tata Motors and Mahindra tractors in Sri Lanka. <IMG Economictime_PL_579_News_1> Imports of vehicle kits are heavily restricted in Sri Lanka owing to the forex crunch.Diesel & Motor Engineering had started assembly of the Tata Ace small commercial since there were import restrictions on completely built units of vehicles. It wants to launch the vehicle soon given the huge demand for such low-cost vehicles, said Pandithage.Demand for Low-cost VehiclesBesides, the distributor can import fully built tractors. However, Pandithage said, “We are facing forex issues to open LCs (letters of credit). Before the season starts, we have a stock of at least 1,000 tractors. This time we have just about 150, which is clearly not enough.”Farmers want to buy new tractors, he said, but higher interest rates and rising inflation are not allowing them to do so.A Tata Motors spokesperson said the company stays committed to the Sri Lanka market and prays that the country recovers from the crisis at the earliest. “Tata Motors continues to have a positive outlook about the Sri Lanka market,” said the spokesperson.Tata Motors has been running its operations in Sri Lanka since 1961 and the country continues to be a priority market. “The company has consistently grown over the years and is now the largest selling commercial vehicle brand in Sri Lanka. It has the widest range of products, from the 750 kg Ace to 45-tonne Prima trucks,” said the company spokesperson.Two-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto said due to the forex shortage, imports of most auto products including two-wheelers and three-wheelers were stopped by the Sri Lankan government almost a year ago. “As a result, our exports in the previous year were negligible. In 2019-20, we exported over 30,000 units, which also was a decline over the previous highs,” said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto. “A small restart was made recently based on efforts to localise and generate employment there. Now, with this dislocation, we have to wait and see how that initiative unfolds.”Mahindra & Mahindra set up assembly operations in Sri Lanka with the Ideal Group to produce the KUV 100 mini sport utility vehicle (SUV) and Bolero Maxi pickup truck in August 2019. “We cannot ramp up production as there is difficulty in sourcing,\" said Nalin Welgama, executive chairman, Ideal Group. “The target was to sell at least 5,000 vehicles a year through this JV (joint venture). We sell about 200-250 of such vehicles a month. Our assembly is continuing despite the forex challenges.”The KUV 100 and the Bolero Maxi are entry-level products and there is a good demand for them, he said.Distributors are hoping they can accelerate production of such low-cost vehicles, which continue to have a good demand in Sri Lanka.Mahindra & Mahindra set up a completely-knocked-down assembly plant in Welipenna through a JV with local partner Ideal Motors. “Our vehicles including KUV 100 and Bolero City Pickup have been well received. Further, last week, M&M signed an agreement with Sri Lanka Police for 750 Scorpio SUVs,” said a company spokesperson. “With over 35,000 customers in Sri Lanka, M&M remains committed to the long-term prospects of the market and will continue to work on building and strengthening its brand and position in the country.”TVS Motors retails several of its two-wheeler models such as the 100 cc economy motorcycle TVS Sport and the 125 cc scooter TVS NTORQ Race Edition through local assembly. The launch of this scooter, in January 2020, triggered a turnaround in the Sri Lankan scooter segment.In January this year, the Sri Lankan government approved the purchase of 500 buses from Ashok Leyland for its transport board.Queries emailed by ET to TVS Motors and Ashok Leyland did not elicit a response till press time.As Sri Lanka battles the worsening crisis, automakers realise that production cannot be immediately ramped up due to economic uncertainty and low business activity, said industry executives. However, local players are confident that production will not come to a complete halt, they said.IN SLOW LANEAs Sri Lanka moved from a market economy to a product economy, exports of CBUs (completely built units) came to a halt Due to forex shortages, imports of most auto products including for 2- and 3-wheelers were stopped by the Sri Lankan govt Automakers are adopting a wait-and-watch approach because of economic uncertainty and low business activityCovid sent Lankan economy into a tailspin, drying up earnings from tourism, foreign remittancesIn March 2020, the govt imposed an import ban on new cars, which left car parts in short supply.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/auto-companies-slam-brakes-on-sri-lanka-exports-production/articleshow/90652434.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_579_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Sri Lankans protest demanding resignation of the government in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Sunday.", "id": "Economictime_PL_579_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-90652440,width-300,imgsize-143304,,resizemode-4,quality-100/sri-lanka-economic-crisis.jpg"}, {"caption": "auto", "id": "Economictime_PL_579_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-90652442,quality-100/auto.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Jeep India launches SUV Meridian", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_598_News_0>Jeep India, a part of the automotive group Stellantis, on Tuesday introduced its new SUV Meridian and the deliveries will begin in June 2022. The Meridian is the company's first three-row SUV designed and engineered specifically for India. It will come with a 2-litre turbo diesel engine with nine speed automatic and six speed manual transmission options, the company said. The model is among the three new products along with Grand Cherokee and Compass Trailhawk that are being launched in India this year. The company had launched the Compass Trailhawk in February at an introductory price of Rs 30.72 lakh (ex-showroom). Stellantis India CEO & Managing Director Roland Bouchara said all these will be produced from the company's Ranjangaon plant in Maharashtra and shows the company's commitment to the Indian market. In a virtual conference, he said in the last two years the company has invested USD 250 million on the development of five products, including Wrangler and Compass, for the Indian market. He said the company sees India as an export hub and the Meridian will also be exported to countries in the Asia Pacific Region, including Japan and South Korea as it has been doing for the Compass model. When asked about the sales expectations from the Meridian, Bouchara said it is difficult to forecast as \"COVID is still not behind us\". However, he said the model will become a key player in the premium SUV segment, which is currently dominated by Toyota Fortuner. Commenting on the EV strategy for India, Bouchara said Stellantis is following the market development closely. Last year, Stellantis had announced plans to invest more than 30 billion through 2025 on electrification of its vehicle line up globally. <IMG Economictime_PL_598_News_1>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/cars-uvs/jeep-india-launches-suv-meridian/articleshow/90525163.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_598_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_598_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-90525224,width-300,imgsize-575458,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-4.jpg"}, {"caption": "2022 Jeep Meridian SUV India", "id": "Economictime_PL_598_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-90525185,quality-100/2022-jeep-meridian-suv-india.jpg"}]}
{"title": "India’s electric vehicles industry sees its first product recall", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_603_News_0>Okinawa Autotech will recall 3,215 Praise Pro electric scooters in the first instance of an Indian manufacturer doing so after a spate of recent fires, said to be related to batteries. \"This is part of its comprehensive powerpack health checkup camps. The batteries will be checked for loose connectors or any damage and be repaired free of charge at any of the Okinawa authorised dealerships pan India,\" the company said in a release on Saturday. Three of Okinawa's scooters have caught fire since October, resulting in two being injured. Ola Electric, Pure EV and Jitendra EV are other companies that have seen their electric scooters catch fire in the last three weeks. Ola Electric is still yet to publicly comment on its investigation into the incidents.Ola Electric, Pure EV and Jitendra EV did not respond to queries sent by ET on whether they are also considering recalls. Okinawa Autotech was the third bestselling electric two-wheeler maker in March with sales of 8,284 units, after Hero Electric (13,023) and Ola (9,127). The move comes as the government considers a recall policy for electric vehicles in line with that for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT), Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Niti Aayog and companies have agreed on the need for such a policy, said people aware of the matter.Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) typically recall vehicles in an affected batch to address issues quickly. This also helps build trust, he said. <IMG Economictime_PL_603_News_1> 'Recall Policy may Take 6-8 Mths'  Globally, auto manufacturers have been recalling electric vehicles (EVs) due to issues with battery systems and improper electrical connections, Kant said.\"There is a need for a voluntary recall policy as it builds confidence in the customer,\" said Kaushik Madhavan, vice president - mobility practice, Frost & Sullivan. \"This way the company also takes responsibility of faulty designs and ensures products are well tested and of good quality.\"Dealers have been terminating contracts, and customers cancelling bookings and seeking refunds, shortening waiting periods, said people with knowledge of the matter. Company executives told ET they are seeking to manage the situation by engaging with government testing agencies ARAI and ICAT, dealers and customers and being vigilant on the manufacturing processes. \"There is a need for policy intervention (recall) but it will take about 6-8 months,\" said Sohinder Gill, CEO, Hero Electric, and president of the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV). \"This is safety month at Hero Electric, which had a town hall for 500 of its dealers. Many customers are making use of the free service available and getting batteries checked. We are fixing sensors in the bikes too as a precautionary measure.\"Ola Electric is among those that have seen booking cancellations although the company didn't confirm this. Pure EV, Okinawa and Okaya have also been hit with cancellations.\"There is a strong need to focus on new product development to prevent such fires in the future,\" said Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal, who recently announced that he will begin to focus more on R&D, engineering functions and products. \"We are investing deeply behind core R&D to create indigenous advanced cell technologies as well as investing in large-scale manufacturing of batteries.\"Focus on R&D EffortsExperts say companies are stepping up R&D efforts in battery management systems and seeking superior technology. EV manufacturers say more companies have begun using lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) technology, which is better at thermal management compared to the more commonly used lithium-ion chemistries like NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt).“Batteries need to be LFP based, considering our extreme heat conditions,” said Anshul Gupta, MD, Okaya Electric, a leading manufacturer of EV charging stations, electric vehicles, lead and lithium batteries, and motors. “Post these fire incidents we have stepped up internal discipline and do aggressive testing at the testing agencies.” Okaya, which is launching an electric scooter this month, supplies battery packs to several OEMs.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/okinawa-to-recall-over-3000-praise-pro-e-scooters-after-fire-cases/articleshow/90887622.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_603_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_603_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-90887632,width-300,imgsize-93322,,resizemode-4,quality-100/okinava1.jpg"}, {"caption": "okinava", "id": "Economictime_PL_603_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-90887637,quality-100/okinava.jpg"}]}
{"title": "FMCG sales grow in February, But home care products decline", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_645_News_0>Demand for fast-moving consumer goods, electronics and lifestyle products recovered sharply in February, rebounding from January when surging Covid-19 infections and restrictions to control the third wave had impacted sales.FMCG sales expanded 17% in February from the prior month, show latest data from Bizom, a sales automation firm that transacts with 7.5 million retail stores and tracks orders by neighbourhood stores. The growth was entirely driven by higher sales of commodities and packaged foods even as home and personal care categories declined. Sales of commodities such as edible oil and packaged atta expanded nearly 19%, while packaged foods grew 12% from the month before. <IMG Economictime_PL_645_News_1>Companies said consistent price hikes over last year helped growth in value, but volume, or the actual number of products people buy, was still under pressure.\"Commodity prices such as of edible oil currently are at a life-time high due to Indonesia restricting exports of palm oil and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This may lead to value growth, but volumes will remain under pressure,\" said Emami Agrotech chief executive Sudhakar Rao Desai.Most consumer goods including Hindustan Unilever, Britannia, Godrej Consumer and Dabur have warned in recent months that prices would continue to rise amid the highest levels of global inflation in decades. The prices of everything from soaps to skincare products have gone up already by 15%.Yet, companies remain upbeat. \"We are hoping that the pain on input costs is short-lived. Otherwise, it might impact consumption and margins in the sector,\" said Saugata Gupta, managing director at Marico.Companies have also red-flagged further inflation and supply disruptions as Russia launched a military assault on Ukraine and crude oil prices topped $110 a barrel. A steep surge in crude oil prices would impact household budgets since crude oil-related products have a share of close to 10% in the Wholesale Price Index basket, and impacts everything from manufacturing home care products to packaging and distribution.\"The Russia-Ukraine crisis could see oil and logistics prices move up further causing more pressure on profitability of FMCG companies. This could further lead to an increase in prices of both food and non-food products that have oil as a key input cost,\" said Akshay D’Souza, chief of growth and insights at Mobisy Technologies, which owns Bizom.For discretionary products like refrigerators and televisions, sales grew sequentially by over 10% last month with a sharper increase in the first fortnight due to pent-up demand and the marriage season, said industry executives.But demand somewhat lost steam subsequently, otherwise the growth would have been higher, said Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi. “The Russia-Ukraine war, increase in crude oil prices, fall in the stock market amid an overall inflationary environment might have been the reasons,” Nandi added.In January, shoppers stayed away from malls and high streets amid concerns over the new wave of the pandemic, hurting sales during what usually are busy shopping days at the start of the year. However, this was reversed in February.Mumbai’s Infiniti Mall chief executive Mukesh Kumar said there had been a strong recovery in footfalls and sales as sentiment improved due to fewer Covid cases and reopening. \"From a 70% pre-Covid level in January, we saw sales move up to 80% of pre-pandemic numbers and March is expected to be a full recovery month helped by pent-up demand despite no mega discounting days,\" Kumar said.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/fmcg-sales-grow-in-february-but-home-care-products-decline/articleshow/89978675.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_645_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The growth was entirely driven by higher sales of commodities and packaged foods even as home and personal care categories declined.", "id": "Economictime_PL_645_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-89978668,width-300,imgsize-101454,,resizemode-4,quality-100/retail_reuters.jpg"}, {"caption": "fmcg", "id": "Economictime_PL_645_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-89978671,quality-100/fmcg.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Stay ahead of the product management curve with the Kellogg Executive Education advantage", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_657_News_0>We live in a product economy. Whether a multinational corporation or a micro start-up, products are the foundation of growth. But developing and managing a product throughout the lifecycle has become increasingly complex due to ever-expanding customer expectations and evolving technology. As new entrants and technologies disrupt growth, many teams struggle to execute viable products that delight customers and drive business value. That’s why C-suite executives are primarily focused on developing and creating new products at the top but rarely do new product launches meet one or more of their targeted business goals. Despite product management suffering from a troubled innovation process, the organizational need to invest in, internally develop, and launch successful products remains strong. The top CEOs of today, from Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of Google to Marissa Mayer, ex-CEO of Yahoo!, and Susan Wojcicki of YouTube, were product managers before they became CEOs. Product managers are, in essence, the de facto CEOs of their products, and 42% of product managers report directly to the board, according to the  Product Management Survey, 2021, which offers them unlimited facetime with the top management and shareholders. Not just this, the demand for product managers who can align all the stakeholders involved in launching or enhancing a product—while also providing a strategic vision—is high. <IMG Economictime_PL_657_News_1>To respond to this demand, Kellogg Executive Education at Northwestern University, ranked #1 for marketing by U.S. News & World Report (2022) and acclaimed to have 19 alumni serving as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, has launched the Post Graduate Certificate in Product Management.

The Pune-based vaccine maker has received the first lot of supplies of key raw materials for Covovax production, company insiders told ET.“Now that we have started receiving raw material, we hope things will pick up pace,” one of them said. The US government had early this month lifted the Defense Production Act (DFA) ratings on Covid-19 vaccine makers, enabling exports of vaccines and inputs.The US curbs had resulted in disruptions in supplies of key inputs needed for Novavax vaccines to Serum Institute. These raw materials included nano filters, plastic bags to store materials at specific temperatures, vials and stoppers.The company had in January said it hoped to launch the Novavax jab in June but delayed it possibly because of the raw material shortage. SII is conducting a phase 2/3 observer-blinded, randomised, active controlled study of Covovax with 1,600 adult participants to “evaluate the safety of its vaccine Covovax in comparison with Novavax-SARS-CoV-2 rS (with Matrix-M1™ Adjuvant) and placebo”. The trials across 15 centres in the country started in May. While the ongoing trial in India is likely to conclude by November, SII is likely to apply for licensure for Covovax in September on the back of global data, sources said. <IMG Economictime_PL_677_News_1>Serum Institute is also planning to start clinical trials of Covovax for children in July.

The study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the US and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. VK Paul, Niti Aayog member, had said on Tuesday that the efficacy data of Novavax vaccine candidate is promising and encouraging. In May, the government officials had said India will see a major vaccine ramp up starting August, projecting over 200 crore doses between August to December.

{"title": "Inventus Capital launches Rs 900 crore fourth fund; rebrands as Athera Venture Partners", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_707_News_0>Bengaluru: Inventus Capital, which has backed companies like RedBus and PolicyBazaar, has launched its fourth fund (Fund IV) with a target corpus of Rs 900 crore (roughly $116 million), as it looks to continue investing in early-stage consumer internet and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startups. Fund IV is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), with a final close still six months away.<IMG Economictime_PL_707_News_1> Inventus has also rebranded itself as Athera Venture Partners. The launch of the fund comes at a time when dealmaking has slowed down with macro headwinds hurting investments and valuations of technology companies.Athera’s latest corpus is more than double its last fund worth Rs 369 crore, the final close of which was announced in October 2019. Through its third fund, Athera invested across 13 new startups including space-tech firm Pixxel; interactive toys company Playshifu and automotive company Euler Motors. This will be Athera's second exclusive India-focused fund.The firm has been investing in Indian startups since 2006. Athera’s first two funds were focused on investment opportunities across India and the United States. The fourth fund is expected to have an equal mix of domestic and international limited partners (LPs), with prominent founders of its portfolio companies, including Redbus’ Phanindra Sama and PolicyBazaar's Yashish Dahiya and Alok Bansal also investing as part of the fundraise. “Over the last few weeks, we have met some of our existing LPs and all of them have said that they will come back with larger cheque sizes to the fund. This has bolstered our confidence despite the environment,” Samir Kumar, managing director and general partner at Athera Venture Partners, told ET. “We have had several companies that have given good exits and people have committed to looking at the DPI (distribution to paid-in) figures that we have. We will remain focused with our heads down despite the noise.” Apart from backing consumer internet and software startups, Athera will also look to invest in upcoming sectors including blockchain and Web3, as well as catch opportunities in the deep-tech, electric vehicles and space-tech sectors.Corrections on horizon There has been a slowdown in investment activity in the first half of this year compared to the frenetic dealmaking pace in 2021.Global funds including Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners have already issued advisories to their portfolio companies on the downturn. “It takes almost 7-9 years for a startup to scale and eventually deliver results. So, it is a very long journey, and you are bound to see multiple economic cycles in that journey, and it eventually smoothens out if you’re coming in early,” said Rutvik Doshi, general partner, Athera Venture Partners, on raising its fourth fund amid a market slowdown. Athera’s total fund close can go up to Rs 1,300 crore, Doshi added. “The good thing about investment is that there is self-correction. This particular downturn will self-correct. So, discipline is essential, and this is a 10-year game, where you cannot look at markups every three months,” said Parag Dhol, general partner, Athera Venture Partners. Dhol said their advice to entrepreneurs is to balance growth with new initiatives, while showing growth and profitability in their core businesses. Athera is looking to write cheques of Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore for startups at the seed stage and expects to go up to Rs 30 crore for early-stage bets. With the new corpus, it will looks to keep 10-15% of the fund corpus to back some of the high growth startups in its portfolio. “Pricing (of deals) is definitely correcting now. Some of the early-stage deals where the median had gone up will correct by 20%-30% … The ‘outliers of excess’ where there are repeat founders (starting up) or well-known people in the ecosystem raising funds at high valuations with no product or substance, those kinds of deals will slow down,” Doshi added. Top-tier VCs including Accel and Elevation Capital have all closed their latest funds and increased their corpus size on the back of a record-breaking year for funding for Indian startups.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/inventus-capital-launches-rs-900-crore-fourth-fund-rebrands-as-athera-venture-partners/articleshow/91793777.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_707_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Athera Venture partners (L to R): Saksham Pant (vice president); Rutvik Doshi (general partner); Swati Murarka (vice president); Parag Dhol (general partner) and Samir Kumar (general partner)", "id": "Economictime_PL_707_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-91794135,width-650,imgsize-845089,,resizemode-4,quality-100/capture.jpg"}, {"caption": "Athera Venture Partner Funds", "id": "Economictime_PL_707_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-91807471,quality-100/athera-venture-partner-funds.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Astrology startups launch apps amid pandemic uncertainty", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_761_News_0>Nearly one and a half a dozen startups have launched apps in astrology, horoscopes, palm-reading and numerology segment since last year, riding on the growing appetite of Indians increasingly wanting to crystal-gaze amid the pandemic-led uncertainty. That is 18 startups, or about a third of the overall universe in the online astrology and spiritual wellness segment in India, according to the latest numbers by Tracxn, a market intelligence provider for private company data.While astrology has been popular in the country for ages, rising online penetration and availability of experts, awareness amongst millennials who are willing to adapt and experiment with the mystic air around astrology to seek life guidance is at its unprecedented high, say companies.\"The pandemic has been an accelerator and we were pushed to our limits of tolerance and patience with never seen human behaviours at play. Mental wellness needs have become quite apparent with seeking guidance and counselling getting dominance in everyone’s consciousness, which gave a rise in the demand,\" said Jikku Abraham, cofounder at Taaraka.Also, unlike traditional janam kundli, these startups use machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analyst software to study planetary bodies, zodiac signs and unique cosmic signatures and predict career and personal growth.\"The pandemic has created situations that pushed many towards depression to the extent that they needed external help to preserve their sanity. In India the most common form of that external help is hope by seeking the help of the divine,\" said Gaurav Tiwari, founder of Sutradhar, a Titan Capital backed spiritual and devotional content provider.About 10 such firms cumulatively raised Rs 130 crore since the start of 2020, three times the combined amount raised by such startups over the previous five years, according to Tracxn.\"When you look at devotion or spirituality as a category in India, getting growth is easy. But what is difficult is to get high quality engagement. We are building something in a very first principle way, trying to move a large offline behaviour online. And we are solving it in a very retention first way,\" said Prashant Sachan, cofounder of AppsForBharat, a product studio for spiritual and devotional content that last month raised $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Elevation Capital along with existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Beenext as well as Matrix Partners India.<IMG Economictime_PL_761_News_1>Since last year, many apps in this domain have witnessed a growth rate of 40-400% month-on-month with at least ten apps having more than 10 million downloads each. \"This is more of a one-off behaviour where we saw that a market which was already written off, some large funds have taken bets. Now it will have a downstream effect as well, where a lot of people will say there's a market opportunity and let us also fund companies in this space. But one must be cautious,\" added Sachan.That's because data reveals that despite the astro frenzy, the alignment of stars and planets are still off for over 40 or nearly three-fourth of all companies, which has not received any funding yet.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/astrology-startups-launch-apps-amid-pandemic-uncertainty/articleshow/86999320.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_761_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_761_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-86999498,width-650,imgsize-43084,,resizemode-4,quality-100/astro.jpg"}, {"caption": "Fundraising By Spiritual Wellness Startups", "id": "Economictime_PL_761_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-86999599,quality-100/fundraising-by-spiritual-wellness-startups.jpg"}]}

Last year, the company had announced the $10 billion Google for India Digitization Fund and had invested $4.5 billion in Reliance Jio Platforms.Over the last few years, Google has increased its focus on developing and creating products for India which it then takes to other global markets. In 2017, Google had launched Google Files Go, a file manager app, for its users in India, which it later expanded to other countries. Similarly, the offline feature for Google Maps was first tested in India.At part of the overall strategy, Pichai said, “In 2022, we'll stay focused on evolving our knowledge and information products, including Search, Maps and YouTube, to be even more helpful.

PepsiCo and McDonald’s are among global giants, which have had to alter their offerings as they were accused of giving unhealthy products, which resulted in trebling of obesity since 1975 and a rising share of population being affected by diabetes and other lifestyle issues.The company acknowledged that it is reviewing its strategy. “We are looking at our entire portfolio across the different phases of people’s lives to ensure our products are helping meet their nutritional needs and supporting a balanced diet. Our efforts build on a strong foundation of work over decades to improve the nutritional footprint of our products. For example, we have reduced sugar and sodium in our products significantly in the past two decades, about 14-15% in the past seven years alone,” Nestle SA said in a statement.As a first step, it is assessing the part of the food and beverage portfolio that can be measured against external nutrition profiling systems. “Systems like the Health Star Rating and Nutri-Score are useful in this regard and enable consumers to make informed choices,” said the company, which sells just nine of its 35 global billionaire brands in India.An international presentation circulated among top Nestle executives earlier this year revealed only 37% of Nestle’s food and beverage products had a rating of over 3.5 as per Australia’s health star rating system, in which products are given scores out of five. Reports suggested that Nestle acknowledged that a part of its portfolio will never be healthy no matter how much the company tried.Under its CEO Mark Schneider, the company has sought to acquire nutritional supplements and vitamins, while seeking to expand its coffee and plant-based businesses. At the same time, it has restructured some of its businesses in the US and China.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/nestle-plans-to-add-more-healthy-options-plans-to-launch-fortified-products/articleshow/83165203.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_717_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Reports suggested that Nestle acknowledged that a part of its portfolio will never be healthy no matter how much the company tried.", "id": "Economictime_PL_717_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-83165396,width-300,imgsize-127525,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Capture", "id": "Economictime_PL_717_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-83162873,quality-100/capture.jpg"}]}

And while the era-defining events pushed the assets towards a euphoric territory, the start to 2022 was anything but ecstatic. The market continued to trade sideways, and even the most promising crypto players kept shedding gains.However, the range-bound market could hardly dent investor sentiments. Leading platforms like CoinSwitch Kuber  continued to see a lot of action over the past week or so. And with new listings taking centre stage, 2022 is all set to become a watershed year in regards to the much-anticipated crypto adoption.But there is a catch to all this! Every year in the crypto timeline requires different strategies to succeed. Therefore, investors planning to make it big in the crypto space in 2022 must follow six golden rules to stay safe and in the green. And while trading over secure exchanges and diversifying the portfolio are still rules enough, we shall cover the 2022 exclusives for now.<IMG Economictime_PL_796_News_1>DYOR religiouslyCrypto tools, bars, charts, indicators, whitepapers, and educational resources are ever-reliable. But for these to work, you must ‘Do-Your-Own-Research’ going into 2022. Crypto is a queer space with every possibility depending on the unpredictable nature of us, the humans. Therefore, every technical tidbit, fundamental insight, and more isn’t going to offer a holistic solution to your investing worries, only a minor advantage. DYOR gives you that edge, provided you spend time religiously, learning the following:Account for volatilityAccording to Nils Gregersen, CTO, Paycer, the current crypto space is experiencing a massive pump. And this trend might lead to a lot of volatility in the coming months when people start cashing out their holdings. And with ‘Pump-and-Dump’ schemes being common in the crypto space, you might see some cooldown or extended consolidation. But that’s not something to be worried about. Not if you are a crypto investor. Do not ride the hype!!!Are you planning to follow Elon Musk in 2022 only for his cryptic crypto tweets? Well, as an investor looking to make it big in 2022, that’s exactly what you ‘Shouldn’t’ do.Crypto hype or even shilling isn’t going to take you far in 2022 when the entire world has its eyes fixed on utilities.Go old schoolThe likes of Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum(ETH), and diverse protocol Altcoins like Polkadot(DOT), Polygon(MATIC), and Solana(SOL) are more like old-school crypto kingpins. These assets have their eyes set on mining scalability, transaction efficiency, blockchain interoperability, and more, making them reliable investment instruments.As an investor, if you aren’t sure about the new altcoins and their purported use cases, going by the book and considering these tried and tested crypto players seems like a better idea.

However, with the market replete with talks regarding a cooldown and consolidation, every dip in 2022 will not be worth buying. To be on the safer side, you should only focus on value-buying if the market or the concerned crypto-asset initiates a fresh rally.Wrap-upWhile 2021 was a year of crypto supremacy, 2022 will redefine ‘Crypto Resilience’. And as an investor, your primary focus should be on knowledge building throughout the year. Also, there will be platforms like CoinSwitch Kuber there to help with insightful listings, trading tools, risk analyzers, and more.Regardless of the speculative ups and downs, digital assets will be hot in 2022.

Brent crude on Thursday rose above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014.“There will further be inflationary impact in the short term,” said Saugata Gupta, managing director of hair oils and health foods maker Marico. “Organisations have to absorb some of the cost push through more aggressive optimisation measures and partially pass the balance to consumers.” <IMG Economictime_PL_809_News_1>Sushil Kumar Bajpai, president at RSPL Group, said the crisis will touch every aspect of Ghari detergent maker’s operations – “from inflating input costs due to high dependence of crude oil derivatives, a key ingredient in soaps and detergents, to distribution and packaging costs after an expected rise in fuel prices”.“This will also impact demand as consumers will see pressure on their daily budgets due to increasing prices across products,” he said.Ukraine and Russia are also key suppliers of wheat, corn and sunflower oil. Nearly 60% of all sunflower oil in India, for example, is imported and Ukraine accounts for nearly three-fourths of the imports.“While we do future buying, there is a limit to which we can buy stocks to hedge future risks,” Agarwal of Emami said.Most companies buy future stocks for about two-three months only.Dinesh Chhabra, chief executive of Usha International, said the surge in crude oil prices and the prospect of a recession in Europe are likely to lead to an increase in the consumer appliances maker’s import costs amid scarcity, since Ukraine is a major source of minerals like copper.“With the geopolitical stand-off between Russia and Ukraine escalating, it could mean a major crisis which is a matter of concern for our industry, especially since we were just about gearing up to shake off the stunting impact of the pandemic,” Chhabra said. “Should the situation escalate further, it is likely to have a grave impact on economies worldwide, India included.”Mohit Malhotra, chief executive of Dabur India, said the consumer products maker is monitoring the situation closely. “We may have to take another round of calibrated price increases in case the inflationary pressures continue unabated,” he said. “As it is, there has been continued inflation in hydrocarbon derivatives, paper-based packing material, and edible oils.”A recent report by Nomura said price pressures will remain beyond February and consumer goods companies are set to further pass on higher input costs amid rising commodity prices to consumers in this quarter. It expects retail prices of home appliances, beauty products, and biscuits to go up.“A sharp rise in fuel prices is likely from March after state elections conclude, unless the government is to further cut excise duties,” the report said. “As the economy normalises, there are likely to be reopening pressures. Finally, elevated levels of household inflation expectations add to the risk of a negative feedback loop back to inflation.”With surging commodities and packaging costs over the past two quarters, almost all companies had in any case taken calibrated price increases of 5-15% across daily household consumption products.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/russia-ukraine-conflict-consumer-companies-flag-inflation-supply-pain/articleshow/89811011.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_809_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_809_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-89811033,width-300,imgsize-1414042,,resizemode-4,quality-100/ukraine-military.jpg"}, {"caption": "Capture", "id": "Economictime_PL_809_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-89811035,quality-100/capture.jpg"}]}

We could have done better if not for the semiconductor shortage. It means the market is ready and the customers are available,” Manolito Vajucic, the brand head for Porsche India, told ET. “Our ambition is the next year will become the best year ever for Porsche India in all aspects, be it in volumes, customer care or market share of sports cars.”Porsche India delivered 334 cars during January-September this year.Vujicic was speaking on the sidelines of the launch of the electric Taycan and the new Macan, tagged upwards of Rs 1.50 crore and Rs 83.21 lakh, respectively.The company saw strong demand post the easing of the lockdowns imposed by state governments to check the spread of the second wave of the pandemic, with sales last quarter increasing 164% compared with the same period of 2020. In July-September 2021, sales also grew 25% over its \"previous best third quarter from 2014”, Vajucic said.<IMG Economictime_PL_831_News_1>He added: \"We see huge potential in the Indian market, not only because of the size of the market here, but also because consumers here are car enthusiasts.

Delivery from these warehouses will be mostly through bikes.“We have over 62 large dark stores spread across around 30,000 sq ft that are used for four- to five-hour delivery of core BigBasket business. These will power the BB Service with an SKU (stock-keeping unit, or product) range of close to 8,000,” Menon told ET.Once launched, this will mark the multi-model approach of BigBasket trying to service various consumer needs. Menon also feels a wider selection to deliver in an hour is a sustainable service.BigBasket has also launched a 20-minutes delivery service, BB Now, with around 3,000 SKUs available, as the race for ultra-fast grocery delivery heats up among players like Zepto, Zomato-backed Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart and Reliance-backed Dunzo. <IMG Economictime_PL_839_News_1>Menon said while he was bullish on one-hour delivery, and his 20-minute delivery service was expanding, 80% of the company’s gross sales would still come from planned grocery purchases through its core model, where it was mostly able to deliver products on the same day.“You would see with a higher frequency of purchases, the average order value goes down. For us, 80-85% of gross sales will come from planned purchases. We are using existing infrastructure built over the years for BB Express without the need to make new investments for it,” he said.ET reported on March 11 that BigBasket was expected to close the current financial year with gross sales of $1.3 billion,compared with $1 billion last year. It aims to grow gross sales by around 40% in the next couple of years.For BB Express, Menon expects the average order size to be around Rs 700-800 while that for BB Now is Rs 450. BigBasket’s average ticket size per order is around Rs 1,300-1,400. Menon said the relatively new service of BB Now was averaging quick deliveries at around 13 minutes, hinting that the promise of 10-minute service was not sustainable. BB Now’s official promise to consumers for delivery is about 20 minutes.\"Firms like BigBasket have to continuously innovate to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving market. Every customer can have different types of needs at different moments. BigBasket is trying to innovate to different needs. It helps that they have supply chains in place which support such innovation and become more efficient in the process,” said Ashutosh Sharma, research director at market research firm Forrester. <IMG Economictime_PL_839_News_2>“Think of it like a bucket full of large marbles and you can fit smaller marbles in between and then further fill it with sand as well. There are different models,” he said.Assisted ShoppingThe company has started setting up franchise-format stores as part of the 'assisted shopping model', where it takes up about 200 sq ft of space in select towns where consumers can pick their products after placing the order on the app, Menon said. The stores will have the Tata-BigBasket branding. It has set up 80 such stores in Andhra Pradesh already and plans to take the total to 1,500 this year.“We need the space and there will be one person to assist the customers on picking up orders. The orders will be serviced through our warehouses,” he said, adding that the Tata-BigBasket branding of the stores would be a pull for the customers under this model.“The idea is to have one such store per town,” he said.These stores will enable consumers to order groceries online and pick them up from nearest stores. This is different from BigBasket's Fresho stores which sell fresh fruits and vegetables and was first unveiled in Bengaluru last year.The continuous offline expansion through various formats also indicates BigBasket and parent Tatas’ belief in the broader market opportunity outside online consumers for grocery shopping. “We want to be everything in grocery (business). This is very strategic in nature as a large portion of customers still want offline shopping for groceries and fresh supplies. The total addressable market is very big,” Menon had told ET in November, at the time of its Fresho store launch.BigBasket' s aggressive expansion and product plans come at time when its parent, Tata Digital, is set to open the much-hyped Superapp Tata Neu to non-Tata staff from next month, as reported by ET on March 15.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/amid-a-10-min-rush-bigbasket-plans-one-hour-delivery-with-more-products-on-offer/articleshow/90382037.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_839_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "BigBasket cofounder and chief executive Hari Menon", "id": "Economictime_PL_839_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-90382773,width-650,imgsize-382567,,resizemode-4,quality-100/hari-menon.jpg"}, {"caption": "BigBasket’s multi-model approach_Graphic_ETTECH", "id": "Economictime_PL_839_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-90382230,quality-100/bigbaskets-multi-model-approach_graphic_ettech.jpg"}, {"caption": "_Graphic_ETTECH", "id": "Economictime_PL_839_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-90382309,quality-100/_graphic_ettech.jpg"}]}

Half of these will be in the fast-growing SUV space and the rest in its core area of small cars. An updated product range at Maruti Suzuki would mean its global alliance partner, Toyota Motor, too would spruce up its portfolio in 2022.The new products could help the local unit of Suzuki Motor seize its lost market share, but also help the automaker reach the 2-million annual sales mark which has been alluding it for the last few years.In the first nine months of the ongoing fiscal 2022, the company has produced 1.164 million vehicles, compared with 939,000 units in the same period last fiscal year.While the performance so far has poised the company to post strong double-digit growth in FY22, the new launches could help is repeat the performance next fiscal year as well. A strong Maruti Suzuki, which sells nearly half the passenger vehicles in India, will also take the Indian market to strong growth. <IMG Economictime_PL_843_News_1>The company did not offer any specific comments on the new product launches or volume growth plans. But in an email response to ET’s questions, senior executive director Shashank Srivastava said one of the key reasons for Maruti Suzuki’s continued dominance in the market was its strong product portfolio.“We have been aggressively mapping customer needs and bringing products aligned with needs of the customers across segments,” he said. “Going forward, we will expand our portfolio across segments including SUVs; as pointed out by you it is a growing segment.”According to several people in the know, there are eight new products including facelifts, refreshes and all new models which will hit the assembly lines in the coming 18 months. The biggest excitement will be around its jointly developed SUV, codenamed YFG, with Toyota which will take on segment leader Hyundai Creta. There is the all-new Jimny, which may wean away some of Mahindra Thar buyers, and a crossover based on the Baleno. There will be facelifts and mid-cycle upgrades of the Baleno, Ertiga, Wagon R. Another on the anvil is a new Alto 800.The new models are expected to bring 10-15% incremental volume.Historically, the company has launched only two-three vehicles a year, including facelifts, upgrades and new models.This time, prior to the new Celerio launch in November 2021, it had not introduced a new model or upgrade for more than 30 months.Its tepid presence in the SUV segment made a big dent on the company’s market share. Maruti Suzuki’s share in the SUV market is only 13%, while in the sedan, hatchback and MPV markets, it is more than 50%. In the entire passenger vehicle segment, its share dropped to 44.7% in December 2021 from 49% a year earlier.Srivastava said supply side constraints, including shortage of electronic components, were among the reasons for the fall in market share.“With pending customer orders of over 230,000 units and good inflow of bookings and reinforced product portfolio, we are hopeful of gaining it back,” he added.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/maruti-suzuki-lines-up-its-biggest-annual-product-onslaught/articleshow/88767663.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_843_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "There are eight new products including facelifts, refreshes and all new models which will hit the assembly lines in the coming 18 months.", "id": "Economictime_PL_843_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-88767677,width-300,imgsize-30574,,resizemode-4,quality-100/maruti-to-hike-prices-in-january-2022.jpg"}, {"caption": "maruti", "id": "Economictime_PL_843_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88767689,quality-100/maruti.jpg"}]}

The company expects to start commercial production of iPhone 13 in India for both the domestic market and exports by February, they said.Apple has secured supply of semiconductor chips - which are in short supply across the world - that has helped it plan expansion of production into India.Production of iPhone 13 in India will help Apple to improve supplies of the model into its global markets since around 20-30% of what is produced in India are usually exported, the executives said.Apple and Foxconn did not respond to email queries as of press time Monday.Meanwhile, supplies of top-selling iPhones have improved, easing an acute shortage in the Indian market, the sources said.In the iPhone 13 series, iPhone 13 is the largest selling model in the country, and the company does not plan to make iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max here. <IMG Economictime_PL_846_News_1>In overall sales, lower priced models such as iPhone 11 and 12 contribute the most in India.Apple already produces iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 in the Foxconn plant and iPhone SE in the Wistron plant in Bengaluru. As per estimates, Apple produces almost 70% of the smartphones it sells in India within the country. Market tracker IDC India's research director Navkendar Singh said Apple has been locally manufacturing a new iPhone model within 3-4 months of its launch in the country. The company had launched iPhone 13 in the country in end-September, in the first phase of its global rollout.“A lot of local production scaling up will depend on component availability,” Singh said. “The local production of iPhone 13 in India may ease a bit the low supplies in the country.”As per Counterpoint Research, Apple was the fastest growing smartphone brand in the July-September quarter with 212% year-on-year growth and led the premium smartphone market (handsets priced above Rs 30,000) with a 44% share.

{"title": "The misunderstood product manager", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_855_News_0>Two decades ago, it seemed you couldn’t walk down a street in Bengaluru without bumping into a software engineer. Today, one of the hottest jobs in tech startups is that of a product manager, or a PM, even when the role doesn’t hinge on technical skills like coding. Senior PMs at well-funded startups draw hefty pay packages, as much as developers at the same level in some cases. Some of the top unicorn founders hailing from a product background simply adds to the lure. It’s a soft-skills-heavy role, and chances are you will be snapped up faster if you are from a top tier B-school.Underneath the hype, though, product management seems to be riddled with several myths and misinterpretations, primarily because the Indian startup sector has yet to establish best practices template for this function “unlike its counterpart in the US that’s had a 15-year head start to do that,” notes Shruti Sharma, senior product manager at a fintech startup in Bengaluru.India is just picking up on the action. Shilpi Agrawal, product manager of a homegrown social network, says product management has become a hot career option of late as a lot of startups launched in the last 3-4 years reached the stage of funding to be able to afford PMs, thus increasing their demand.“I get a lot of juniors from my engineering college (BITS Pilani) who are interested in it,” she adds. <IMG Economictime_PL_855_News_1>PMs have formed a community on Twitter and Instagram in recent times, says Sharma, a former marketer. This community has room for debates as well as clever memes that express the woes of their professional lives. Woes like the unclear scope of their role and whether it is a lonely or a glorious one, to the “CEO vs Janitor” debate that they often find themselves embroiled in... In our interaction with almost a dozen PMs over the last week, product managers came across as a misunderstood breed of mostly non-techies in a tech universe. Let’s try to understand them and explore what those best practices could look like.What does a product manager do?Broadly, “a product manager finds the right problems to solve, finds the solutions to them, and aligns all members into it,” says Shivangi Srivastava, product head (new initiatives) at a hyperlocal startup in Bengaluru. Different companies define PMs differently though. Sometimes companies hire them as PMs only to perform the role of project managers or program managers, whose job pertains to executing a plan that’s supposed to have been laid out by the PM. You know this lack of clear distinction between a product manager, a project manager, or a program manager hits a raw nerve with the community when it makes its way to memedom. Exhibit A: PMs can also get consumed by the job of executing tasks. They tend to underestimate the change in their role from one week to another, says Shyvee (Xinyu) Shi, a product manager at a global networking platform in San Francisco. “They have to set boundaries to be able to do “deep work”.” What’s the hype all about?The promise of great salaries despite no hard skills makes it a lucrative career option for many entry-level professionals as well as those looking to pivot into startups. For people with entrepreneurial aspirations, there’s an added incentive: Product managers are often compared to the founders/CEOs of startups, given the involvement of frequent, high-stakes decision-making in both roles. Some of the most popular founders of consumer internet companies were former product managers, like Kevin Systrom, the cofounder of Instagram. “The PM’s profile also offers better opportunities for growth within the organisation that an engineer at the same level may not always get, including the prospect of becoming a CEO,” adds Taruna Manchanda, a Bengaluru-based product manager. Both Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc (parent entity of Google), and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, rose up the ranks in the Google universe via the product management route. It is a glorious career path, then?Debatable. As Srivastava points out: A product manager has all the responsibilities of a founder, but none of their authority. A PM works with and through different departments like engineering, design, data analytics, quality assurance and control, among others. Members of these divisions do not report to the product manager.“People have to follow you not because you say so, but because you convinced them to,” says Srivastava. <IMG Economictime_PL_855_News_2> That’s one way to look at it. “I say, you’re like a conductor in an orchestra. You don’t own any instruments, but it is up to you to bring out the best from the group,” says Shi from San Francisco.It's not that simple though. Many PMs feel theirs is a lonely job. You pass on the accolades to the teams but take ownership if things go awry. You are also concerned that a genuine attempt at bonding with other teams may be interpreted as a strategic move, says Manchanda. Most startups maintain a PM to developer ratio of 1:5 or 1:10. “That ratio works against you as you have to get 10 people to like you,” says Vindhya C, a senior product manager at a stock photography platform in Germany. Friction is bound to happen in such circumstances. On most occasions, it’s nothing but a misunderstanding, says Poorvi Shrivastav, senior director, product management, at a global software company based in California. That PMs try to exert dominance in every situation is another misinterpretation of their role, she says. “You’re always trying to balance your vision with the art of possible. Sometimes, when there’s too much chaos in meetings, you cut people short because you’re coming from a position of driving outcomes at a speed.” If the PM is a woman, their tendency to interrupt is even lower, reckons Shrivastav. A lot of this friction is often a PM’s own doing, though, says Pratiksha Dake, head of product at an edtech company, hinting at instances of PMs encroaching on designers’ and developers’ territory. “PMs are supposed to be deep generalists, not specialists,” Dake says.Instead of overstepping boundaries, adds Vindhya, a product manager could tell the designer: “Here’s what I want done, and here’s how I want the user to perceive it… You tell me how this looks like.” <IMG Economictime_PL_855_News_3>“PMs must also be thick-skinned and should say No to developers and designers, albeit compassionately, if that is indeed the right thing to do,” says Shi. They should apply the same logic to their own thought process as well, adds So Yun J Maryn, SVP - digital products at a company in Washington DC. “Due to everything needing to be built fast, one can miss on building the right thing. For example, to redesign an airline ticket, we may ask if elements of the ticket are the problem, but is there a need for a ticket in the first place?” asks Maryn, author of ‘A Toolkit for Product Managers’.  <IMG Economictime_PL_855_News_4>Taking a leaf from Maryn’s book, Vindhya urges all product management enthusiasts to look beyond the hype. “Nobody is going to tell you your next-mile goal. You have to keep learning and unlearning things as you enter newer spaces, sectors, and it can be frustrating.”Don’t get into it because it’s the in thing to do right now unless you see yourself doing this for long, she says. Meanwhile, Agrawal points out how some consumer internet startups in India “do not have a PM and still sustain well.” Even as Vindhya herself finds meaning in this domain, she feels many people are getting into this race without knowing what it entails. “And very few finish it.”Note:", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-bytes/the-misunderstood-product-manager/articleshow/85278617.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_855_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "(Graphics and illustrations by Rahul Awasthi/ETtech)", "id": "Economictime_PL_855_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85291495,width-650,imgsize-1312320,,resizemode-4,quality-100/product.jpg"}, {"caption": "Decoding the hype around product managers_Graphic_ETTECH", "id": "Economictime_PL_855_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85290494,quality-100/decoding-the-hype-around-product-managers_graphic_ettech.jpg"}, {"caption": "product manager has all responsibilities of a founder, no authority", "id": "Economictime_PL_855_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85290154,quality-100/product-manager-has-all-responsibilities-of-a-founder-no-authority.jpg"}, {"caption": "Instead of encroaching on their territory, share your vision and show you trust them to deliver", "id": "Economictime_PL_855_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85290174,quality-100/instead-of-encroaching-on-their-territory-share-your-vision-and-show-you-trust-them-to-deliver.jpg"}, {"caption": "making the right decision instead of a quick decision", "id": "Economictime_PL_855_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85290605,quality-100/making-the-right-decision-instead-of-a-quick-decision.jpg"}]}

{"title": "ONDC: Government’s Amazon, Flipkart challenger will see pilot launch in 5 cities in April", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_894_News_0>The open public digital infrastructure framework, the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), is all set to launch its beta version in April.Anil Agrawal, Additional Secretary-DPIIT, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, is bullish about what lies ahead. “We have identified five cities — Delhi, Bangalore, Coimbatore, Shillong and Bhopal — as we wanted to keep a geographical spread across the board. We have a trader base in these five cities which is getting prepared on the intricacies of transacting on ONDC,” he said, while speaking at the TiEcon Delhi-NCR Unstoppable India virtual event held last month.The beta mode is likely to be completed by the end of April and the launch is expected to be in August. “Companies such as Paytm, Dunzo, PhonePe, Go Frugal, GrowthFalcons and Microsoft are in advanced stages of integration with ONDC. We have moved much beyond the hype,” he said, responding to a question on how it is being seen by some as another “hyped up” initiative by the government.Incorporated in December 2021, the proposed network seeks to control digital monopolies and create more inclusiveness within the digital commerce ecosystem. It is expected to benefit the millions of small retailers for whom traditional ecommerce platforms are still out of reach.“If you look at a small kirana merchant, he has to get onboarded. But it is very tough. He can't create a catalog, manage his inventory or orders. A whole lot of hand holding is needed. By one estimate, there are six crore small retailers in the country and another estimate says that only 15,000 retailers are currently onboarded onto ecommerce. So even if you get a fraction of the six crore small traders on to this network, there is a huge opportunity that will present itself. Besides, not all of them will speak English, so entire user interfaces will have to be built in local languages,” Agrawal said. <IMG Economictime_PL_894_News_1>He pointed out that this can be advantageous for a host of entrepreneurs looking to make a dent in the market. “If, for example, a housewife in a tier-three city wants to order something from the local kirana store, an interface in the local dialect will be a must. So, there is a huge opportunity for startups and entrepreneurs who want to create their new ecommerce platforms.”Explaining more on why the government decided to set up such an initiative, Agrawal illustrated his point with an example. He recalled how when Covid struck, the government was trying to reach out to citizens in containment zones and trying to connect them with the suppliers of essential commodities. “Imagine a multi-storied society. One person in a flat is using one app, while someone else is using another. There is a kirana store in that housing society and we are trying to connect the two. So, if you take kirana store on platform A — a tedious process — as he has to follow the proprietary protocols of KYC, getting the catalogs, etc. So, he gets only those customers who are onboarded onto that particular platform. The seller has to go to the second platform if he wants to access the customer of the second platform,” he said. This made them think about standardisation and it was when the idea of ONDC was actually derived, the additional secretary said.Talking about how a central registry would come in handy, Agrawal said it would work out extremely well for the public good. “If a seller gets registered on a common registry, rather than a platform, and then everyone follows the same protocol, anyone who has to buy something checks up the registry first. So, for that particular product, you check the registry which is public. It's a public good. What happens is one seller, instead of being visible only to one platform, gets visibility across all platforms,” he said.Delving more on how such an entity would stand out among the crowd, Agrawal added that the biggest advantage of ONDC was unbundling. “For example, in ecommerce today, you get all the services bundled together. You order and then everything in the order is fulfilled. Here, you have a choice. If you want to buy from a particular vendor, this is the cost without delivery and the cost with delivery. You can go pick up the order yourself or you can ask about the delivery options. As a seller, he becomes a buyer for logistics service providers. We have lots of logistics service providers who are getting integrated into ONDC. So, there is a real-time transaction taking place,” he explained.The framework has been generating a lot of buzz in industry circles. Last month, Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) acquired a 7.84% stake in ONDC to facilitate market access for MSMEs. Private sector lenders HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank too acquired 7.84% stake each in ONDC. The government is looking at expanding in a big way over the next few months.According to Agrawal, almost 80 major companies have been working with their technology teams to get integrated onto the ONDC network.Addressing a question on whether ONDC would have an impact on existing players such as Amazon and Flipkart, Agrawal said such an expansion of the market was inevitable. “We are not trying to disrupt anything. It is not against anyone. It is about democratising and making more and more small traders come on to the digital commerce framework which, today, is very difficult.” He, however, said the siloed approach currently used on ecommerce platforms poses issues. “If a customer is on Amazon, he can only buy from sellers who are on Amazon.

{"title": "Top consumer companies ready to splurge on ads", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_935_News_0>India's leading consumer companies are readying to spend up to 12% more year-on-year on advertising and promotion in the rest of this financial year, driven by higher sales during the festive season and revival of discretionary and out-of-home consumption.Companies such as Tata Consumer Products, LG, Parle Products, Marico, Dabur, Emami, Voltas and Haier have said in earnings calls or their executives have told ET that they will use the budget unutilised in the first half of the fiscal due to the second Covid-19 wave and step up spending to support new launches, increase sales and expand market share. This is despite record pressure on input costs.\"We were not spending as much as we would have liked or as much as we needed to spend to build competitive strengths for our brands because, ultimately, building brands gives you more pricing power and builds margins in the portfolio. And, therefore, you will see the spending going up,\" Sunil D'Souza, managing director at Tata Consumer Products, said on an analyst call. <IMG Economictime_PL_935_News_1>India's largest biscuit maker Parle Products will increase the budget for the second half of the fiscal by 10-12% year-on-year, said senior category head B Krishna Rao. \"Since last year's sales base was high, we need to increase the spend. Otherwise, we may lose revenue and market share,\" he said. Marico is likely to increase its advertising spend at least one percentage point in the coming quarters given more media clutter and everything opening up, managing director Saugata Gupta said on an investor call.  Growth Across Categories  The maker of Parachute coconut oil and Saffola oil said it will also start spending on the discretionary part of the portfolio.Consumption has picked up since August across categories such as daily necessities, food and grocery, electronics and white goods, apparel and lifestyle products, with brands and retailers saying sales touched or surpassed the pre-Covid period during the festive season. The decline in infection rate amid high vaccination, easing of Covid-induced restrictions and opening up of offices and educational institutions also triggered out-of-home consumption and improved the overall demand scenario.Emami's director Mohan Goenka said the company has shifted some advertising and promotion budget to the second half of the fiscal since it could not spend in the June quarter due to the pandemic. It will spend \"aggressively in the second half\" compared to last year, he said.Companies are planning to increase ad spend despite record surge in input costs forced them to cut costs, increase prices or reduce pack sizes.\"The increasing input cost pressure is more than compensated by strong market growth, which will mean we can increase advertising spends in double digits,” said RS Sodhi, managing director, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd, the maker of Amul dairy products.Most companies expect strong sales by value following price hikes, even as volume growth could be challenging. Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands India, said companies which are sales growth oriented will advertise more compared to those that are focused on profitability. “Also, we expect promotion will go down due to rising commodity costs, but advertising spends will be hiked,” he said.Manufacturers and retailers in discretionary and high-value products are also increasing spending, after bumper sales during the Diwali period. India’s largest retailer, Reliance Retail, said in an investor presentation that physical fashion stores made a comeback, with regional promotions driving revenue. LG is increasing its advertising and promotion budget by 5-10%.

These dark stores would typically have a stock-keeping-unit (SKU) of 1,000-3,000 products per store.Flipkart will have wider selection since the company takes longer time to deliver, the source cited above said.The company is not overhauling its 90-minute delivery model, but is just “optimising the steps” to reduce delivery timeline, the person said.Also read:Scaling up grocery and Shopsy will be priority, Flipkart CEO saysFlipkart Quick, which was launched as a 90-minute delivery service, is present across 14 cities and the company plans to take it to over 200 cities by 2022.Flipkart will also look to expand its fresh vegetable and fruits business under the broader grocery category. The service is currently available in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. <IMG Economictime_PL_1039_News_2>According to a report by Bernstein Research, India is leading other global markets in terms of quick commerce adoption. Quick commerce penetration as a percentage of online grocery is 13% in the country, while China is at 7% and Europe is at 3%. Quick commerce targets mid/high-income households in large metros who seek convenience over price.But players across the sector are at the moment burning capital with no profit in sight.ET had reported on Monday that Swiggy's Instamart and Mumbai-based Zepto are looking to launch private label products soon to improve margins and reduce burn. <IMG Economictime_PL_1039_News_3>Private label products are goods sold by retailers under their own brand names. Many brick-and-mortar retailers and ecommerce companies have private labels, which offer a fatter margin than selling third-party brands.

Last week, it launched the Android app in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Clubhouse is still taking a measured approach with its Android app launch. Last week, the company said it will stick to its waitlist and invite system on Android for now and open it up further in the coming months.This is because the company says it grew much quicker than expected, partly owing to the pandemic. \"This had its downsides, as the load stressed our systems—causing widespread server outages and notification failures, and surpassing the limits of our early discovery algorithms,\" Clubhouse said in a blog post. \"It made us shift our focus to hiring, fixing, and company building, rather than the community meetups and product features that we normally like to focus on.\" <IMG Economictime_PL_1049_News_1>Over the past few months, the social audio segment has attracted attention from several tech companies such as Twitter, Discord, Facebook, Spotify, Reddit, LinkedIn, Slack and Telegram, which have either launched or are working on their own competing products.Twitter's social audio service Spaces currently allows all users in India to host audio chatrooms, which the company calls a \"Space\". Outside India, Twitter users with 600 or more followers can host a Space.An Android app is crucial for Clubhouse to get a much-needed user boost as its downloads have slipped in recent months.

It has clocked about 6,700 downloads until May 16, as per data shared by Sensor Tower.That said, Clubhouse's current Android app is quite barebones in terms of features as compared to its iOS counterpart at present. The app doesn't allow users to link their social profiles, change their profile name, follow a topic, or create or manage a club.In recent months, Clubhouse has raised back-to-back funding from investors Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global and Tiger Global among others and is currently valued at $4 billion, a four-fold jump from its $1 billion valuation when it raised a reported $100 million in Series B funding in January.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/clubhouse-android-app-to-launch-in-india-on-may-21/articleshow/82705268.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1049_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The social audio app Clubhouse is seen on a mobile phone in this illustration picture taken on Feb. 8, 2021.

Facebook refers to the new product as a ‘personalised’ destination for news within Facebook with users getting top headlines and stories for the day based on their interests. News is only available on the Facebook apps for Android and iPhone in the US currently. Brown said the US launch of Facebook News marked a new chapter in the company’s relationship with the news industry and it’s off to a ‘strong start.’ Facebook News was launched in the US in June. “Helping publishers reach new audiences has been one of our most important goals, and we’ve found over 95% of the traffic Facebook News delivers to publishers is incremental to the traffic they already get from News Feed,” he added.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1068_News_1>Sensing declining ad revenues due to Covid-19 in the media industry, some countries have been demanding tech companies should pay publishers for news content.

The companies could be asked to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for non compliance under the code released by The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as per reports. In France, antitrust regulators ordered Google to pay for content from French publishers in April.

However, this may change for the better given the planned new car launches in 2022 and a possibility to regain the market share for the country’s largest passenger vehicles (PV) maker.The company’s market share in the PV segment dropped 430 basis points year-on-year to 44.7% in December 2021 following chip shortage and lack of new launches in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment. Before the launch of the new Celerio in November 2021, it had not introduced a new model or upgrade for more than 30 months.The tide may be turning for the company with a slated launch of nearly half a dozen SUVs in the next three year ranging from sub-four metre to a large 4.4 metre. The product introduction will start from the next fiscal year with the launch of the two SUVs, one would compete with Hyundai Creta while the other, Jimny, would be positioned against Mahindra’s Thar. These models together are expected to add nearly 2.5 lakh vehicles a year to the company’s volume.<IMG Economictime_PL_1093_News_1>The success rate of Maruti’s new launch is significantly higher than its counterparts given its pan-India retail network. In addition, with an ebbing chip shortage, the company plans to increase production to nearly 8,000 vehicles a day in March 2022 from around 6,500 in December 2021. This would help the company to produce around 4,90,000 units in the March 2022 quarter taking the full year tally to around 1.65 million. It would imply 15% growth for FY22.Vahan, the national vehicles registry, shows that Maruti’s retail market share started improving month-on-month since October 2021. It had a retail market share of 44.4% in December 2021. The demand for passenger vehicles continues to be robust with the order book of car makers reaching nearly half a million; nearly half of this belongs to Maruti. In December 2021, Maruti’s dealer inventory dropped to a record low of less than a week or about 10,000 units.On the margin side, metal prices appear to be peaking and the cost pressure on the raw material basket for automakers is inching down.

Prosus Ventures (previously Naspers) joined the fundraising as a new investor. With this, Mensa Brands has now valued at over $1 billion within six months of starting operations, making it the fastest startup to enter the ever-growing group of Indian unicorns—firms valued at $1 billion or more.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1122_News_1>Existing investors like Accel Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Tiger Global Management also participated in the round. In total, Mensa has raised $300 million in equity and debt funding. It has acquired around a dozen brands already and is working on closing another 20 such deals, Narayanan said. Mensa intends to use the funding to continue to grow its portfolio and will use the new capital to invest in hiring across functions and continue building out its tech platform and other growth capabilities.“We are truly platform neutral and our brands are present across different platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho and others. We are excited to back more founders and brands and scale them further,” he said. “Our deep focus on technology and digital brand building, as well as our people, has allowed us to grow three times of our initial plan and we are primed to build global breakout brands from India.”Mensa’s latest fundraise comes at a time when the space is seeing increased traction, with several startups like SoftBank-backed GlobalBees, Goat Brand Labs, 10club are also acquiring new-age brands and working with them to grow their presence. US-based Thrasio—which pioneered this business model in 2018—is looking to enter India, as reported by ET. These ventures have raised significant capital and are in conversations to raise more as the competition heats up. Narayanan said India doesn’t have enough brands and it’s good if more people are working in building new brands here. Last month, Mensa acquired brands like Karagiri, Priyaasi, Dennis Lingo, Ishin, Hubberholme, Anubhutee, Helea, Villain. It picks anywhere between 51% and 75% stake in these brands and aims to grow them along with their original founders. Mensa is largely focusing on categories like fashion, beauty and personal care, and home. According to Narayanan, the majority of the brands it has acquired so far are growing at 100% year-on-year since their integration with Mensa. “Mensa demonstrates a tangible uplift through a combination of product and pricing optimisation, technology-led process improvement, distribution and marketing augmentation and fine-tuning the supply chain. These levers meaningfully accelerate the growth and margin trajectory of the brands and make them well-poised to become category leaders,” said Navroz Udwadia, cofounder and partner of Alpha Wave Ventures (Falcon Edge Capital).Ashutosh Sharma, head of investments, India, Prosus Ventures, said Narayanan brings formidable expertise in building market-leading consumer brands at scale. “Their team brings superior execution focus and technology chops to help emerging brands scale digitally. This is an incredible time for made-in-India businesses, and we look forward to helping to fuel their future success,” he added.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/mensa-brands-turns-unicorn-within-six-months-of-launch/articleshow/87733523.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1122_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Ananth Narayanan, founder, Mensa Brands.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1122_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-87733494,width-650,imgsize-141257,,resizemode-4,quality-100/ananth-narayanan.jpg"}, {"caption": "Indian Startups in 2021", "id": "Economictime_PL_1122_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-87733524,quality-100/indian-startups-in-2021.jpg"}]}

The National GIS-enabled Land Bank system- a database of industrial areas and clusters across states- has information on more than 3,300 industrial parks across 31 states and UTs covering about 4.75 lakh hectare land.“Information available includes forest, drainage; raw material heat maps (agricultural, horticulture, mineral layers); multiple layers of connectivity”, the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement, adding that the project is launched for six states with others likely to be onboarded by December.<IMG Economictime_PL_1164_News_1>The portal will also have information related to champion sectors and high priority sectors under “Make in India” such as state and district wise net industrial land available, relevant contact details, traces the land available for investment, current external infrastructure geo-tagged such as road, rail, airport and dry port connectivity to all industrial hotspots.One District One ProductOn the approach of ‘One District One Product’ (ODOP), Goyal said that the approach seeks to add existing industrial capacity beyond the urban areas and create productive manufacturing from a rural/semi urban areas.“The minister said that states should identify products with a market potential for import substitution and export accentuation, and establish forward and backward market linkage channels,” the ministry said quoting Goyal after he had a virtual meeting with the industry ministers of states and UT administrators to promote industrial activity and investmentIt added that states will identify products unique to each district to develop districts as export hubs, and integrate with their district level exports strategies which would then feed into the state level export strategies.“District and cluster level export strategy will benefit artisans and small and micro scale producers thereby integrating them directly with global supply chains,” Goyal said.The exercise is part of India’s efforts to attract investments into the country.

They have also prioritised arrangements for staff’s health.Lava, a homegrown handset maker and contract manufacturer for Nokia phones, has decided to shut its factory for the next few days due to uncertainty around consumer demand. Dixon Technologies has halted operations at its LED lights manufacturing plant, people familiar with the workings of both the companies said. <IMG Economictime_PL_1180_News_1>“Our labour workforce, managers and team members are consistently facing Covid-19 emergencies, leading to the complete collapse of our work ecosystem,” said Arjun Bajaj, director of Videotex International, which manufactures televisions for Realme and Toshiba.Videotex has prioritised the safety of its workers and cut production by over 50%, Bajaj said.“…we will monitor this situation, and if it does not improve, we may also have to halt our production temporarily for a few days,” he added.Covid-19 restrictions in several parts of the country and fear of economic hardships have already hurt consumer demand, with market trackers like Counterpoint Research cutting its smartphone shipments forecast for the April-June quarter by 5 million units to 32-34 million.To be sure, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have permitted their large electronics clusters to continue production, but delayed logistics, rising cost of components and the additional burden of repeated Covid-19 tests have forced some companies to either reduce operations or halt them altogether.New Launches Unlikely“Brands are cautious of an inventory pile-up, so there will be reduced activity around new launches, marketing and production as well,” a top executive at a leading Chinese smartphone maker told ET.The executive said states like Maharashtra are slowly emerging out of peak crisis mode and that has kept optimism alive about a sudden pullback in demand.Vivo, Lava, Transsion and Dixon did not respond to ET’s queries till press time.MCM Telecom, Veira Electronics, TMB Battery, Khy Electronics, Salcomp, Sunwoda, Jabil, JSP electronics, Hong Guang De Technology and VVDN could not be immediately reached for comment.“So far, we are at about 85% of our regular production levels due to some absenteeism,” said Amrit Manwani, MD of Sahasra, which makes printed circuit boards. “Being in exports, we have to meet delivery commitments, so we are not planning to shut down.”", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/electronics-handset-cos-slash-production/articleshow/82396211.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1180_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Videotex has prioritised the safety of its workers and cut production by over 50%, Bajaj said.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1180_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-82397426,width-300,imgsize-97355,,resizemode-4,quality-100/phone-afp.jpg"}, {"caption": "5", "id": "Economictime_PL_1180_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-82397415,quality-100/5.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Companies launch new products at low price points, responding to pent-up demand", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1238_News_0>NEW DELHI: Bottom-of-pyramid or entry-level pricing is back as large companies respond to green shoots of pent-up demand, launching packs and new products at price points as low as 50 paise, Re 1 and Rs 2.50. Given that even sporadic lockdowns hamper business in cities, consumption growth from rural India is now outpacing urban demand riding on higher farm incomes and minimal retail disruption.ITC, Dabur, Amul, CavinKare and Coca-Cola are among dozens of companies pushing newer and lower price points, backed by increased direct reach in rural markets and ahead of the curve investments. Industry executives said they are betting on lower price points and higher reach to swing demand in rural India, which has been relatively insulated from lockdowns, as they expect rural demand to drive the growth at a time when consumption in urban markets remains uncertain. <IMG Economictime_PL_1238_News_1>“Our farmer engagements, agri linkages and distribution reach are well poised to respond to emerging demand in rural India,” a spokesperson for FMCG-tobacco giant ITC said. At the forefront of the company's five new launches during the lockdown is Savlon sanitisers at 50 paise.“Savlon hand sanitiser sachets address the issues of accessibility, affordability and availability. We expect quick adoption of the brand by rural consumers as hygiene and immunity boosting products are now at the forefront of consumer demand even in rural markets,” the spokesperson said.Data by research firm Nielsen last month said consumption growth in rural markets is expanding at double the rate of urban markets where overall growth in the FMCG segment is estimated at about 5% in the next nine months.“Aspiration levels in rural India have grown and the consumer there is seeking the same products as their urban counterparts, but at their price points,” Dabur chief executive Mohit Malhotra said. To feed this growing network, the company has expanded its portfolio at prices lower than existing ones across categories including fruit drinks, toothpastes and hair oils, all of which have helped push demand growth, he said.Companies are pushing the envelope to tap niches across existing and new categories.India’s largest dairy company Amul, which sells milk, ice-cream, butter and cheese, added Panchamrit or packaged prasad offered in temples, across its parlours, retail counters and e-commerce platforms last week. Amul MD RS Sodhi said the single serve packs of Rs 2.50 each are 'reasonably priced'. “The product is affordable, has a shelf life of four months, does not require refrigeration, and it is getting demand from international markets,” he said.Chennai-based CavinKare, which sells a range of hair-care and personal-care products, said it hopes to repeat its Re 1 sachet success in shampoo when it extended its Chik shampoo franchise to sanitisers priced at Re 1 last quarter. “We are a company born out of sachets; this is a product for consumers across rural markets as much as it is for urban consumers,” CavinKare chairman CK Ranganathan said.Ratings and research advisory Crisil said while FMCG companies’ sales are expected to contract 2-3% in the current fiscal, rural India should fare better. It attributed the reasons to the government’s economic package, which stepped up allocation of funds under the MGNREGA by an additional Rs 40,000 crore and forecast of a good monsoon, among other reasons.Beverages maker Coca-Cola, which has tied up with the Government-backed Common Services Centre’s Grameen eStore store to service rural markets, is working on stepping up entry-level pricing for its beverages. “Innovative ways to reach the consumer along with affordability will be important to drive demand; the partnership with CSC is aimed at promoting availability of beverages at doorsteps in rural India,” a Coca-Cola India spokesperson said. He named entry-level priced beverages such as Rimzim Apple Pop, Minute Maid Nutriforce, Maaza Refresh and Aquarius Glucocharge as examples aimed at rural consumers.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/companies-launch-new-products-at-low-price-points-responding-to-pent-up-demand/articleshow/77006696.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1238_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1238_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-77006640,width-300,imgsize-392404,,resizemode-4,quality-100/fmcg-bccl.jpg"}, {"caption": "facebook ET logo", "id": "Economictime_PL_1238_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-77006737,quality-100/facebook-et-logo.jpg"}]}

They are now waiting for malls to reopen and restrictions on retail store timings to be eased.Some early shoots of revival are already visible, marketers said. For FMCG companies, the spending will be on categories which are in demand, like packaged food, immunity boosters and health and hygiene products. Electronics and smartphone makers will promote new launches as well as consumer offers to liquidate stocks. But a major boost to ad spending will happen only around the festive season, they said.ITC said it has been ramping up advertising of essential foods brands in categories like atta, noodles, biscuits, juices and hygiene products across all platforms since last month, and that it will soon touch pre-Covid levels. “This (advertising) is expected to increase further as things start normalising and consumption demand gets a further boost,” a spokesperson at the FMCG-to-hotels group said. Frontline FMCG firms like Dabur, Marico, Godrej and Amul too are set to increase ad spending, having launched more than three dozen new products among them in the past two months. Vivo has started a campaign for its new smartphone across media, including outdoor and television. LG India and Sony said they are readying media campaigns, as they have started witnessing pent-up demand. <IMG Economictime_PL_1236_News_1>India’s largest smartphone brand, Xiaomi, said it has not cut its marketing budget and has already started spending with several new product launches. “The share of voice is very important and consumer companies fear market share loss if they don't invest on advertising,” IPG Mediabrands India chief executive Shashi Sinha said. “We expect about 80% of the FMCG firms to bring back their advertising spends at pre-Covid levels after their distribution reach normal levels,\" he added.It is critical to have a top of the mind recall and investing on advertising is more important now than earlier, as consumers are buying whatever they can find on the shelves, said B Krishna Rao, category head at India’s largest foods company, Parle Products. “We will spend aggressively on advertising which will help us stay relevant and take advantage of a situation when rivals could lower their marketing spends to save costs.” Marico’s CMO, Koshy George, said his company will be selective on advertising and promotional spending during this time. It will rationalise spending on discretionary segments while reallocating budget from non-media to media channels in the near-term, he said, adding: “This is primarily to drive the share of voice in the core.” Godrej Consumer Products CEO (India & Saarc) Sunil Kataria said new developing categories like hygiene will require more investments to ensure habit creation among consumers.Most apparel and electronics retail chains are waiting for a majority of their stores to reopen to resume advertising. In foods and grocery, however, companies have started advertising as they aim to entice consumers back, with the massive surge in orders in the early days of the lockdown easing out.

A number of these initiatives were already in the pipeline and we advanced the launch to meet the emerging need gap in the market,” said Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer, Dabur India, that launched new products such as all-purpose disinfectants, immunity building juices and air sanitisers.According to Nielsen, hand wash segment expanded 60% in March compared to 7% in the preceding three months, floor cleaner growth rate doubled to 24% while hand sanitiser balloned by 340% in March compared to 24% in December to February.In modern trade, immunity booster sales surged in March from the preceding three months – Chyawanprash by 81% from 2%, branded packaged honey by 35% against 10% and turmeric by 38% from 7%.“The innovation teams in ITC are identifying these unmet needs and racing against time to craft effective and innovative products in the health and hygiene space to serve these requirements,” said Sameer Satpathy, chief executive (personal care products business) at ITC that extended its Savlon brand in hand sanitiser and disinfectant spray. The company is also developing more such products. <IMG Economictime_PL_1298_News_1>Marketers also feel consumers could shift some of their discretionary spends into health products, boosting demand. “The health, hygiene and immunity market will expand tremendously.

{"title": "Electric vehicles ride high in Motown amid chip blues", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1308_News_0>A global shortage of semiconductor chips continues to hamper passenger vehicle production in India and elsewhere with automakers losing billions of dollars in earnings, but there is one silver lining in Indian Motown – electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction.At a time when car buyers in the country have to wait for 2-8 months to get possession of their dream cars, many are turning to EVs from manufacturers such as Tata Motors and MG Motors.A positive outreach by manufacturers, improved charging infrastructure, and price parity with conventional vehicles on the back of government incentives and falling battery prices are driving the demand, experts said.“We need to look at fundamentals,” said Rajeev Chaba, managing director of MG Motor. “EV trend is a global and local trend due to more environmental awareness and ‘cost of ownership’ reasons. In India, we believe (and have been vindicated so far) that customers are ready and are waiting for good solutions, and the EV trend would grow significantly.Last month, the company received more than 700 bookings for its ZS EV, a five-seater electric SUV.The country’s most-affordable electric SUV, the Tata Nexon EV had clocked 1,022 unit sales in August – the first time an electric car in the personal mobility segment posted four-digit sales in a month. <IMG Economictime_PL_1308_News_1>“EVs are fast gaining popularity on the back of rising comfort of customers, as the barriers to adoption are being overcome and due to growing preference for environmentally friendly solutions,” said Shailesh Chandra, president, passenger vehicle business unit, at Tata Motors. “Increasing support from the central and state governments, providing subsidies and a conducive environment for EVs to grow, inspires us to expand our EV offerings.”Tata Motors launched EV version of the Tigor sedan last month. The government has clearly indicated push for electrification and EV infrastructure is being built across cities through public-private collaboration. Overall EV sales in the country clocked 28,919 units last month, a growth of over 10% over July. EVs accounted for 2% of all vehicles sold in the country for the first time last month, doubling from 1% in January, according to data compiled by policy research institution Centre for Energy Finance at Council on Energy, Environment and Water at Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF).This is likely to improve this month as more than 3,000 EVs were retailed in the first two days alone. Experts said subsidies will increase adoption, encourage research and development (R&D) and innovation, and help in making EVs reach about 10% of the overall two-wheeler market in five years.“Multiple EV sector policies such as the FAME II scheme and individual state policies provide EV buyers with purchase incentives,” said Meghna Nair, research analyst at CEEW-CEF. “Multiple CPOs (charge point operators) like EESL, Tata Power, Magenta, etc. have spoken of their ambitions to grow their charging network,” she said. State and central government incentives have helped bring down on-road EV prices to be at par with petrol or diesel-powered vehicles in many states.Electric two-wheelers are expected to show faster penetration with a number of players like Ola Electric entering the space. There is a lot of traction coming in from ecommerce companies and logistics partners for electric three-wheelers, thanks to price parity with conventional engine vehicles. EV sales have been showing an increasing trend across most states since January this year following stronger incentives and policies and the deployment of charging infrastructure across the country. “Another interesting trend is an increasing number of vehicle manufacturers entering the charging space in an attempt to build a complete ecosystem,” Nair of CEEW-CEF said.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/electric-vehicles-ride-high-in-motown-amid-chip-blues/articleshow/85930056.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1308_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Experts said subsidies will increase adoption, encourage R&D and innovation, and help in making EVs reach about 10% of the overall two-wheeler market in five years.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1308_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85934443,width-300,imgsize-27108,,resizemode-4,quality-100/ev.jpg"}, {"caption": "g123", "id": "Economictime_PL_1308_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85934474,quality-100/g123.jpg"}]}
{"title": "India launches ‘trusted’ telecom portal", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1326_News_0>The government Tuesday launched a 'trusted telecom' portal as a part of the national security directive on the telecommunications sector.The new portal under the Cyber wing of the National Security Council Secretariat will mandate telecom service providers to use the equipment through trusted or authentic sources only.The development has come following the government's efforts to ensure security of telecom networks, especially with fifth-generation (5G) service on the anvil. The initiative is widely believed to discourage the use of China-made gear in the country's core networks.“NCSC portal has been launched for trusted sources for telecom equipment. COAI members have always been compliant with Government directives and will continue to do so in future,\" SP Kochhar, director-general, Cellular Operators Association of India said.Delhi-based COAI represents incumbent private operators as well as multinational technology vendors.Huawei Technologies has been accused of backdoor access in telecom networks, a claim that has been strongly opposed by the Shenzhen-based company.However, both Swedish Ericsson and Finnish Nokia also partly manufacture their equipment in China-based facilities.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio, for its mega fourth generation or 4G service foray, deployed gear from Korean Samsung Networks while Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea continue to partner with Chinese Huawei and ZTE.The two older incumbents have entered into a deal with Chinese Huawei ahead of telecom license amendment in March this year that mandated the use of equipment procured through a 'trusted source' from June 15, 2021. Bharti Airtel expanded its National Long Distance (NLD) network with Huawei while rival Vodafone Idea roped in Chinese gear maker for wireless and wireline network upgradation. Both deals together, according to market analysts, are said to be worth more than Rs 500 crores.However, the new directive does not mandate the replacement of existing equipment already operational with the telecom service providers.\"From among the sources declared as 'trusted sources' by the designated authority, those that meet the criteria of the Department of Telecommunications' preferential market scheme will be certified as Indian trusted sources,'' the directive added.It further said that the National Security Committee on telecom will take measures to increase use of equipment from such 'Indian Trusted Sources' in domestic telecom networks.Through this initiative, the government aims to bring enhanced supervision and facilitate effective control by telcos and designated authority over nationwide telecom networks.Queries to Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea did not elicit any response.In April this year, the government unveiled the beta version of the portal for telecom service providers (TSPs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in order to collect sample data that can be qualified as trusted products.The new portal would act as a certifying window and gear suppliers empanelled with the authority could track the progress of approval of their applications.In the new online system, telcos would be required to furnish the details of network products along with suppliers' name, and upon its examination, the service provider may either be allowed or restrained from deploying such equipment. The list of equipment to be covered under this directive and methodology to designate a specific product as a trusted, would however be defined by the office of the National Cyber Security Coordinator (NCSC) Lt Gen (Retd) Rajesh Pant who reports to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). <IMG Economictime_PL_1326_News_1>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/india-launches-trusted-telecom-portal/articleshow/83550626.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1326_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In April this year, the government unveiled the beta version of the portal for telecom service providers (TSPs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in order to collect sample data that can be qualified as trusted products.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1326_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-83553267,width-300,imgsize-808946,,resizemode-4,quality-100/telecom.jpg"}, {"caption": "Govt Launches ‘Trusted’ Telecom Equipment Portal", "id": "Economictime_PL_1326_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-83554659,quality-100/govt-launches-trusted-telecom-equipment-portal.jpg"}]}
{"title": "India needs new vaccine launches to meet targets", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1332_News_0>New jabs will soon need to be launched and existing capacities rapidly scaled up, if the government’s projections for vaccine availability and production are to be met.The government had in a presentation in May estimated that 216 crore vaccines will be available in the country between August and December. Subsequently, in an affidavit filed by the authorities with the Supreme Court in June, these projection was scaled down to 135 crore jabs.But, with the exception of Covishield, its not clear whether any other vaccine maker will be able to deliver the jabs in the estimated quantities. Out of the five vaccines mentioned in the Supreme Court affidavit, one is still undergoing clinical trials and another is awaiting regulatory approvals. The production of Covaxin and Sputnik V, the two other vaccines that are available in the country, is lagging way behind projections.Biological E’s anti Covid-19 shot Corbevax is currently undergoing Phase-3 clinical trials and there is no clarity about its launch date. The government had estimated that Bio E would account for 30 crore jabs from August to December. An email sent to Biological E did not elicit any response. Ahmedabad based Zydus Cadila had applied for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for its vaccine on July 1, but the application is yet to be taken up by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) that advises the drug regulator on approvals for vaccines, new drugs and clinical trials. The government had projected supply of 5 crore doses from Zydus between August-December. According to a source the company may get an approval by the end of next week.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1332_News_1>Another person aware of the situation said the regulatory authority was closely reviewing the data. “There are some concerns regarding the immunogenicity data which is not up to the mark and this is taking time,” said a person.Zydus cadila did not respond to an email sent by ET. The government had in its affidavit estimated that about 10 crore (100 million) Sputnik V vaccines will be available from August to December. So far, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, the distributor of Sputnik vaccines in the country, last week told ET that it has received 3.15 million doses of component 1 and 4,50,000 doses of component 2. Unlike other Covid vaccines, the components of the two Sputnik V doses are different.\"DRL said there is no update beyond the last status update last week.”Several Indian companies including Serum Institute of India have entered into tie ups to locally manufacture Sputnik. But they too are said to be facing manufacturing issues with producing the second component (AD5) of the adenovirus vector-based vaccine and it is not clear when they will get approvals and roll out production.The government had in July told the Parliament that the average monthly production capacity of Covishield is 11 crore doses, and of Covaxin is 2.5 crore doses.While Serum Insitiute of India appears to be on track for meeting the official projection of making 50 crore Covishield doses between August and December, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin appears to be lagging behind the 40 crore production estimate for this five month period. “We are expecting an increase in (Covaxin) supplies now with the addition of the Gujarat facility. But the supplies are expected only in September,” said a source. Bharat Biotech did not respond to an email query sent by ET. The government has also given permission for Johnson& Johnson and Moderna vaccines to be sold in the country. But there is no clarity at present on the volume of jabs they will supply to India, and whether they government will indemnify them against future compensation claims in case of adverse effects.“The target to vaccinate everyone by the end of this year looks unlikely with the availability of vaccines that we have right now. The projection of 135 crore vaccines from August to December look aspirational too. The government says that there are five vaccines in the basket but there is no clarity yet on the availability of vaccines like Moderna and J&J,” said a public health expert.The government has set a target to vaccinate everyone above 18 year by end of this year. According to Covid 19 india.org, So far 8.7 % of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated. 30.3% of eligible population has got at least one dose of the vaccine. Over 52 crore Covid-19 doses have been administered in the country so far, Union health ministry said Wednesday. Malini Aisola, co-convenor All India Drugs Action Network said that the target looks unachievable. “Government has continuously been sharing inflated and misleading projections for Covaxin production. The problem is a self created one due to putting in place a monopoly of Bharat Biotech for this vaccine that precluded multiple private and public units producing the vaccine independently which would have boosted supply to government. It also makes no sense to share targets for vaccines like Zydus and BE vaccines which are still in trials and yet to receive regulatory approval. Sputnik V looks set to fail completely and cannot be counted on for the vaccination drive. All local production is at a complete standstill with no Indian firm willing to start making the vaccine due to the issues with large-batch manufacturing of the second dose”.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/india-needs-new-vax-launches-to-meet-targets/articleshow/85259297.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1332_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1332_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85260730,width-300,imgsize-754319,,resizemode-4,quality-100/virus-vaccine-getty.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1332_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85259296,quality-100/.jpg"}]}

Peak power demand, or the maximum demand at a given point of time, is rising. Agreements for most of the anticipated demand are tied up with power producers, but any incremental demand is usually met through purchases on the exchange.This short-term market is expanding at 10 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), at twice that of the overall power demand growth. Hence, the share of the short-term market has increased from 8.9 per cent in FY15 to 10.6 per cent at the end of FY19. This growth in the short-term market has led to 16 per cent CAGR in traded volumes on the exchanges for the same period.

The suggestion was made at a high-level meeting held recently.It's estimated that rice fortification costs Rs 0.73 per kilogram. This translates into an incremental cost of about Rs 2,655 crore for fortified rice covering the entire government food security plan, which is 1.1% of the total annual food subsidy bill of nearly Rs 2.43 lakh crore for FY22.Consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal recently chaired a meeting on the proposal with top officials of stakeholder ministries - including those of health and women and child development.NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, along with the think tank's members VK Paul and Ramesh Chand, also attended the meeting, which deliberated on the progress of an ongoing rice fortification pilot project and the future course of action. The government had identified 15 states for the pilot scheme. However, only six have launched it so far in select districts.\"The aim is to roll it out in 250 districts, including the aspirational districts and high-burden districts, from April 1, 2022,\" said the person cited above. <IMG Economictime_PL_1389_News_1>Rice is a staple for 65% of India's population and a key component of the government's food security programme.

{"title": "Eicher Motors valuation premium to narrow due to moderating volumes of Royal Enfield", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1393_News_0>Eicher Motors, the maker of marque Royal Enfield bikes, is expected to face a significant drop in sales volume as customers tend to postpone discretionary spending amid pay cuts and job losses. Nearly 85% of the company’s customers are upgraders — buyers who already own a vehicle and buy a new one for novelty factor. This raises the risk of deferring or even cancellation of new purchases as customers tend to save on the budget by opting for cheaper bikes amid the economic slowdown. The pressure on margins and volume for the second year in a row may weigh on the stock. Royal Enfield’s (RE) volumes have contracted for the past six quarters in a row. The total volume for FY20 fell by 15.6% to nearly seven lakh units. It further skidded by 85% to 19,204 units in the first two months of the current fiscal. Analysts expect a drop of 15-20% for the full year, which will result in a five-year low annual volume.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1393_News_1>To counter the low demand, the company will continue with the strategy to launch a new product every quarter. The success of these new models will be crucial in reducing the dependence on the Classic-350 model, which forms nearly 70% of the company’s total RE volume. RE’s market share in more than 125 cc bike segment has been in the range of 24-27% since FY17. Lower utilisation of plants and inability to fully pass on the higher costs due to regulatory compliance have affected the company’s operating profitability. The operating margin fell by 700 basis points to 20.8% in the March 2020 quarter. Though the gross profit per unit of RE expanded by 2% following lower raw material costs, the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per vehicle dropped by 11%. This was because the average price increase of 10% per unit was not sufficient to cover the entire spike in costs due to regulatory changes such as inclusion of anti-lock braking system, disc brakes and the compliance cost regarding new emission norms.  Although the company has hiked prices by Rs 3,000 per unit in April 2020, margin pressure may persist. Given the challenges on the demand and margin fronts, the stock’s premium valuation over mass market peers such as Hero MotoCorp has been gradually narrowing. Eicher Motors’ current stock premium is 60% compared with the long term average of 79%.

{"title": "Tech that, 2022! iPhone 14, Galaxy S22, OnePlus 10 among most-awaited launches", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_0>The year 2021 was a mixed one for the world of tech with its highs and lows due to the ongoing pandemic. Geeks around the globe witnessed the sporadic launch of smartphones, the global chip shortage and the rising cost of labour and components, that in turn, made flagship phones costlier than ever. From Apple’s iPhone 13 line-up to Samsung’s Galaxy z Fold 3, 2021 saw several big-ticket launches of premium smartphones. Not just Apple and Samsung, smartphone makers such as OnePlus, Oppo, Google also came out with their stunning products to woo consumers. Those launched in 2021 boasted of spectacular technology, and users around the world are anticipating more revolutionary flagship smartphones in 2022. Here is a list of top smartphones that are likely to be trendsetters in 2022.Samsung Galaxy S22 seriesIn the last few months, there have been several leaks surrounding the upcoming Samsung Galaxy 2022 series. Historically Samsung has launched its phones in February or March, however, its S21 line-up was launched in January 2021. However, it remains to be seen if the brand unveils its S22 series in the first quarter of the new year. The biggest expectations from the S22 line-up are around its cameras. A recent report hinted that the S22 series will have a P-shaped camera module and that the brand will retain its 108-megapixel primary camera from its Galaxy S21 Ultra. <IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_1>iPhone 14In 2021, Apple went on to release its iPhone 13 series and the premium phones have been consistently hailed as the best phone of the year. The brand has managed to sustain the buzz around its plans for its upcoming devices. A recent report by 9to5Mac suggested that the iPhone 14 and iPhone15 series will get significant camera updates. It has also been predicted that the new models will have 48-megapixel cameras compared to the existing 12-megapixel sensor. Moreover, iPhone 15 which is likely to be launched in 2023 is said to have a periscope-shaped lens. <IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_2>OnePlus 10 seriesOnePlus has already announced that it will launch its premium flagship OnePlus 10 and OnePlus 10 Pro in January 2022. A series of leaks have already revealed the possible design and specifications of the top-tier 10 Pro model. The OnePlus 10 Pro will flaunt Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chipset and an improved selfie camera of 32-megapixel. Many reports have suggested that the phone may retain several features that were seen on the OnePlus 9 Pro. The phone may also have a 48MP main camera, 50MP ultrawide, and an 8MP 3.3X telephoto camera in its triple-camera setup. <IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_3>iPhone SE3The upcoming smartphone from Apple is likely to be launched in the first half of 2022, according to MacRumours. It is likely to feature the A15 Bionic chip, the same that powers the iPhone 13. At present, the iPhone SE functions on the A13 Bionic processor. The SE models of 2016 and 2020 had Touch ID, the upcoming SE 3 may be the first in the series to sport a Face ID. There are rumours that the phone may retain its SE design or it may assume the design of the iPhone XR. <IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_4>Xiaomi 12Xiaomi is gearing up to launch its flagship phone - the 12 series in the next year. The phones already secured an A+ score from DisplayMate, the worldwide leader in video diagnostics. The 12 series is expected to create a buzz considering its display features. According to a company statement, the new phones come with high-precision screens with exceptional colour accuracy – 16,000 level brightness adjustment. It was also reported that the Xiaomi 12 series screens will have a high PPI and 10-bit colour depth. <IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_5>Oppo Find NThe recently launched phone, Oppo Find N, is touted to be a strong contender to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold series. The clamshell-style smartphone has a 7.1-inch inner display and a 5.49-inch outer display. Once folder, the phone has an 18:9 aspect ratio making it easy to use with one hand. Both displays come with an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The phone comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset paired with up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. The phone will set a precedent for foldable phones in 2022. <IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_6>Vivo X80Although there are no official announcements yet, the Vivo X80 has generated considerable interest. The brand will reportedly use the new MediaTek Dimensity 9000 chipset for its upcoming phone. The line-up is likely to include Vivo X80, Vivo X80 Pro, and Vivo X80 Pro Plus. The phones may have a full HD+ display with a 120 Hz refresh rate and are likely to have a 50-megapixel main sensor, 5-axis stabilisation, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with an integrated 2x zoom. <IMG Economictime_PL_1453_News_7>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/tech-that-2022-iphone-14-galaxy-s22-oneplus-10-among-most-awaited-launches/articleshow/88544893.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Apple, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo all are set to unveil their latest smartphones in 2022.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-88545631,width-650,imgsize-24706,,resizemode-4,quality-100/image-83.jpg"}, {"caption": "Image (84)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88544909,quality-100/image-84.jpg"}, {"caption": "Image (68)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88544930,quality-100/image-68.jpg"}, {"caption": "Image (85)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88544981,quality-100/image-85.jpg"}, {"caption": "Image (86)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88545036,quality-100/image-86.jpg"}, {"caption": "Image (87)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_5", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88545178,quality-100/image-87.jpg"}, {"caption": "Image (88)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_6", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88545543,quality-100/image-88.jpg"}, {"caption": "Image (89)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1453_News_7", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-88545567,quality-100/image-89.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Why Siddhartha Lal needs to rev up Royal Enfield with launches and innovations", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1456_News_0>After the lowest quarterly sales growth in six years, Siddhartha Lal, alpha male boss of Eicher Motors, flew to Chennai, home of Royal Enfield (RE) Motorcycles, last November for a critical strategy meet.With special guests from Google, Redbull, Maruti Suzuki and McKinsey, among others, the idea was to refresh and map the future. Over three days, Royal Enfield’s management discussed future mega trends with the help of McKinsey and a digital landscape through the eyes of Google. Vikaas Saxena and Avik Chattopadhyay, former marketing directors of Redbull and Maruti Suzuki, both did a walk-through on revitalising brand equity.The preceding months had been high on testosterone. The company got rave reviews for its most ambitious global bet — the twin cylinder motorcycles to take on Harley and Triumph globally. Simultaneously, back home, it was grappling with slowing growth, changing regulations, irate customers and labour woes. Floods in Kerala also dented sales. While the core of management discussion was a longer-term blueprint, there were immediate issues such as a torpid topline and falling demand from wellpenetrated clusters to deal with. This — along with rising brand fatigue, lack of credible successes beyond the Classic range, concerns over cost of ownership, a steady price increase and, more importantly, customer acquisition challenges — was fast becoming a Molotov cocktail. <IMG Economictime_PL_1456_News_1> DELTA-VThe rise and resurrection of Royal Enfield from a fading icon to a global pin-up has been an amazing triumph of entrepreneurial chutzpah, ingenious strategy and an undying passion by the iconoclastic Lal, who breathes, lives and swears by the brand. In just a decade, under Eicher’s management, RE swung from a loss-making unit to the most profitable — based on operating profit margin — two-wheeler maker and a stock market darling. Even today, Eicher’s market capitalisation is 33% higher than Harley’s, at $9.2 billion.However, over the last 18 months, even as new capacities were coming onstream, booking growth was slowing. The growing base was catching up. RE’s rise had woken bigger rivals Harley Davidson and Triumph. A couple of dozen new options have emerged in 150-500 cc space in Royal Enfield’s sweet spot, that is, Rs 1-3 lakh. The widening price gap between Enfield and its rivals is also affecting sales. While the likes of Hero and Bajaj employ an aggressive pricing strategy, new safety regulations that call for mandatory ABS have hiked prices at RE — almost `25,000 since May — making upgrading to Enfield a step too steep for many. Falling volumes in some states is a cause for concern, though RE continues to enjoy over 90% market share in the super-250cc segment. <IMG Economictime_PL_1456_News_2> Key states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra, which account for a third of RE’s sales, have seen a double-digit decline for several quarters now and may cause single-digit company growth for the first time in a decade. Walk-ins and enquiries are declining and conversion is stretched out, indicating systemic stress, a channel check by ET indicates. July-September same store growth was negative and new stores in towns and smaller cities — a largely commuter-dominated market — are barely making up for numbers. Same store growth was 15% and 10% in FY17 and FY18.Moderation of outperformance has also diluted investor faith. Institutional investors such Capital Group and Teacher Insurance and Annuity Association of America have pruned exposure. Over the past year, share price too has slipped 25%, eroding market cap by a significant Rs 18,000 crore. To put it in perspective, this is equal to 70% of TVS Motor Company’s total market cap.Mahantesh Sabarad, head, retail research, SBI Cap Securities, says RE hasn’t been able to keep up the excitement around its new products as a resistance to aggressive competition and category saturation, even though it is still in a position to take advantage of premiumisation. Stock has corrected but valuation derating is yet to happen, he cautioned. Eicher’s valuation premium over mass bike makers has come down to 35.7%, versus 75% of the last five-year average, and trades at 23.4x based on the next 12-month earnings while the average PE for mass bike-makers is 17.23.LANE STEALERS PUT A SPOKESince the beginning of the second quarter of FY19, the industry has been hit by West Bengal Regional Transport Office rule change, floods in Kerala and Uttarakhand and insurance hikes running into the festivities, pulling down sales. It’s clear RE is no more a niche player and any kind of macroeconomic headwinds will have an impact, something dealers too can sense. A leading western India dealer says RE was insulated from big shocks such as demonetisation and BSIV, but not anymore. Earlier, it was a waitlist of months. Today, many dealers are sitting on 2-3 weeks of inventory. Clearly, operations need to change. “We can’t sit in the showrooms and wait for customers to come. It is an effort now. We have to engage in activities and advertise to draw new buyers,” says the dealer, requesting anonymity. <IMG Economictime_PL_1456_News_3> A strike at one plant led to production loss of 28,000 units in FY19. Yet, there was no major change in the order book, which highlights weak underlying demand. Lal, though, remains unperturbed as he terms slowing sales “short-term clouds” and assures that his view on medium- and long-term has not changed. “It’s normal for a business to have some ups and downs. We view business from a long-term perspective and keep improving. Of course, there are small clouds, which we are tackling. But, nothing that is insurmountable,” he says.REBOOT & RIP IT UPLal, to be fair, is keen to hammer down and fire up the imagination and the road once again with new twin technical centres in the UK and Chennai, modern manufacturing facilities, fresh talent and field experts to guide them. “We are learning and improving every day,” he says.The company that has been accused of lacking new model interventions will unleash at least a dozen motorbikes in next three to five years, which would mark “the new phase.” Lal is even ready to accede a gap in technology; hence, next generation models need to become the basis for future. While Twins was the first step to ensure Royal Enfield is seen as a serious player globally, he wants to equally focus on getting the J platform — a replacement of his bread and butter Classics – spot on.But the company has not yet been able to fix the perception on quality and cost of service, feel experts, despite a cult following. The high-profile Himalayan launch was derailed by poor quality — oil leakage, gear shifts and steering issues — that stunted growth in the initial launch phase, leading to temporary shutdown of production. Some niggles were addressed with the BS IV variant, which has improved demand for the model, though nowhere close to target.Lal, who spends 85% of his time at RE, has hired Japanese experts to address quality issues, which are getting fixed right at the design, development and manufacturing level. A rigorous 1,000-point checklist is now followed to ensure very high quality, say people in the know.The company also brought McKinsey on board for richer forecasting and strategy and PwC for digital infrastructure and planning process while Accenture is already on board for a retail upgrade programme, ReCode. There is, however, a feeling that silos are being created and it is a challenge working with an MD who literally lives out of his suitcase. Company watchers claim phone calls and video conferencing is inadequate for a company of this scale. RE is moving its corporate headquarters to Chennai in the first half of 2019 for more cohesion between CXOs in management, manufacturing and engineering.The game plan is to shift to a single integrated office before rollout the new generation J architecture, which will become the backbone o f its 350-400cc bikes in BS VI avatar. It is speculated that Lal himself may move back to India ahead of this. The shift has caused anxiety at various management levels, with at least a dozen experienced resumes already circulating in the market. With sales head Shaji Koshy likely to retire soon, RE roped in Vimal Sumbly, former head, Triumph India, who, many believe, is being groomed to take charge of Indian operations. Pankaj Sharma, formerly of Volkswagen, is set to take charge of international operations. Lal remains ostensibly unfazed by the chatter. “For us it is about nurturing products and brands,” he says.Royal Enfield does not have the privilege of a global partner. It is a true homegrown company and it is facing a huge challenge in rollout of the BS VI version. The project is running late and may have an impact on volumes. Plans for global M&As also did not materialise after its 2017 pursuit of Ducati. But with a new management at its VW parent reviving plans of a portfolio pruning, many speculate the prospect could resurface sooner than expected. In the last five financial years, premium motorcycle segment 150-250 cc almost doubled in India. However, the 350-500cc segment was single-handedly driven by Royal Enfield, which grew more than 10 times to 8.33 lakh units. Now, close to a dozen new models are likely to hit the market from the likes of Harley, Triumph, Jawa and others.While competition is intensifying, the trend of people moving up the price point and comfort actually puts Royal Enfield in a sweet spot. A senior executive associated with the company says the attempts to copy Royal Enfield will only help the brand. “Many players have attempted to challenge Activa or Splendor time and again, but both these brands have only grown and continue to rule their segments. I see the same thing with Classic,” says the executive on condition of anonymity.Of the 20 lakh two-wheelers sold, just 4-5 models occupy 75% of the market while 40 other brands fight for the balance 25%. Thus, a single brand driving the show at a two-wheeler company is not peculiar. In note released in November, Brokerage Credit Suisse’s Jatin Chawla said, “We remain cautious about Eicher — as it is likely to be the worst impacted by regulatory cost increases — and cut volume estimates to factor in weak volume trends resulting in an 8-10% cut to our estimates.”Kapil Singh of Nomura in a note post September quarter results said the key risk for Eicher is that competition in the 350cc segment is likely to increase sharply from FY21F, which could affect Royal Enfield. For instance, M&M plans to launch its cruiser motorcycle Jawa at year-end. Also, Harley Davidson has aggressive plans to launch 250-500cc motorcycles in India from 2020 and has already tied up with a key manufacturer in Asia. Additionally, Bajaj Auto will be launching the Triumph brand in this segment.PASTA ROCKET VS GROCERY GETTERWith supply exceeding demand after a long time, new ways of reaching and getting customers is the key and the company needs to identify market growth enablers and bring in genuine product innovation to grow from here, feel experts. Back home, from being a weekend ride, the Enfield is now used for daily commutes. Even user age has come down to 25-35 over the last few years. With volumes approaching one million annually, Royal Enfield is entering a very sticky phase.The dilemma is how to retain premium and yet maintain scale. “One thing is clear — RE will not run behind volumes,” says an old-time company associate. “It will aim to grow faster than the mainstream motorcycle market but not at any cost. Focus should be on building the category, the DNA, the engine and architecture without getting tempted into offering something others offer. We should wait for people to buy us, instead of going out and shouting, ‘Buy me buy me.’” “RE may well draw inspiration from luxury car companies that have a wide portfolio, yet form and character is very similar,” argues Alpana Parida, managing director, DY Works, a brand consulting firm.Lal is clear he wants to be a creator. He reckons that to challenge someone in their stronghold is “very bloody” exercise the moment you ask about his plans to enter the high volumes 150-250 cc space. “Why should we go where other people are when we can grow the mid-size motorcycle market, which is at around 1.5 million? We help it grow to 10-15 million; that is where we want to be. Then what’s the way ahead? The twin cylinders bring Royal Enfield into a serious reckoning globally, but Lal knows it is long, hard, organic game that needs to be viewed with a 10-15 year horizon.It is hoping the brand can evolve into Indonesia, Thailand and emerging Latin American market just like it did in India. Twins are likely to be an ideal upgrade option to over 2.5 million RE bikes sold over the last five years locally. Lal is hoping that what Classic did in 2008-09 for RE, Twins can do in the coming years. Two-wheeler expert Rishad Cooper is confident about Royal Enfield’s future. He reckons Twins are by far the best motorcycles made by RE yet. He says RE is on a good footing and the managing director himself has the right approach — willing to listen, learn and adapt.Lal says RE is just getting started. In India, it has just 5-6% share and in the global markets, it is a minion, so the potential is huge. “We have capital, capability and brand knowledge. I don’t think anybody has the type of combination we have to what we want to accomplish. We would be fools to divert the attention,” he says. Not a detour perhaps, but Lal sure has plans for a wheelie.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/why-siddhartha-lal-needs-to-rev-up-royal-enfield-with-launches-and-innovations/articleshow/67171508.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1456_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The twin cylinders bring Royal Enfield into a serious reckoning globally, but Lal knows it is long, hard, organic game that needs to be viewed with a 10-15 year horizon.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1456_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67171738,width-300,imgsize-344011,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_1456_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67171762,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_1456_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67171768,quality-100/2.jpg"}, {"caption": "3", "id": "Economictime_PL_1456_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67171771,quality-100/3.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Masked, jabbed & tested: CEOs get back to in-person meetings", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1470_News_0>Several C-suite executives — most of them fully vaccinated — have restarted face-to-face business meetings, declaring that these are far more productive than virtual ones forced on them by Covid-19. One company boss said online meetings were akin to a pilot in a simulator, rather than actually flying a plane. Chief executives and the senior leadership at Xiaomi India, Parle Products, Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Future Group, Levi’s, Panasonic India, Bosch Siemens’ home appliances arm, Mercedes Benz, Skoda Auto, Edelweiss AMC, upGrad and Axis Securities, among others, have resumed in-person meetings. Some of these entail travel to other cities to take stock of manufacturing and strategising with sales teams, besides meeting vendors, business partners and external stakeholders. This comes as businesses have recovered strongly after the second Covid wave and are planning for the crucial festive season that starts in a few weeks.Personal meetings with dealers or customers are very critical to gauge the pulse of the market, as long as all protocols are observed, said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director for sales and marketing at India’s largest car maker, Maruti Suzuki. Future Group chief executive Kishore Biyani and its leadership team have been holding face-to-face meetings regularly, as well as those at the country’s largest biscuit maker, Parle Products. “The buzz is returning to offices,” said Parle senior category head Krishnarao Buddha. Flipkart chief executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy and Myntra CEO Amar Nagaram, along with other senior leaders, have started going to warehouses to oversee supply chain operations, meet employees and bolster their spirits.Edelweiss AMC chief executive Radhika Gupta has conducted a few meetings at five-star hotels with senior hires and clients, since offices are still shut for outside visitors. <IMG Economictime_PL_1470_News_1>RAISING SPIRITSAxis Securities managing director and chief executive B Gopkumar has started scheduling a few weekly face-to-face meetings. With online fatigue setting in, these can help reignite a sense of belonging and allow team members to forge stronger bonds, he said.Manu Kumar Jain, chief executive of India’s largest smartphone maker, Xiaomi, last Monday tweeted that he was “super happy” to visit the office after four months and was looking forward to meeting some team members, even though work from home continues.Sharad Agarwal, head of the Lamborghini brand in India, has started meeting external stakeholders ahead of a model launch this week.Panasonic India CEO Manish Sharma has been holding oneon-one meetings, apart from the few he did at the plant. Santosh Iyer, who heads sales and marketing at Mercedes Benz India, recently went to Mumbai and is now adding more cities to his calendar.“The connection and intensity is much better from face-to-face meetings as compared to virtual, online ones,” said Delhi-based Sanjeev Mohanty, managing director for South Asia, Middle East and Africa, Levi Strauss & Co, who undertook his first business trip this weekend since the pandemic to meet team members and business partners in Bengaluru. He said attending a meeting is a personal choice and perceptions of safety can differ.To ensure safety, strict Covid protocols are observed at all such gatherings, with double masking being the norm. Some CEOs restrict attendance to those with both jabs or a negative Covid test report. Companies typically facilitate these before such meetings.And it’s not just office conference rooms--cafeterias, office rooftops, open-air cafes or five-star hotel coffee shops are venues for such work meets.Mayank Kumar, MD at edtech startup upGrad, said it’s much easier to brainstorm, find solutions and get the ball rolling at physical meetings. “I would compare it to being in an aircraft seat versus being in an aircraft simulator,” he said.However, several companies such as ITC, Nestle, LG, Reliance Retail and Dabur are yet to restart physical meetings, waiting for cases to drop further, all employees to get both vaccine doses and be sure that the next pandemic wave is not anywhere near.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/masked-jabbed-tested-ceos-get-back-to-in-person-meetings/articleshow/84333678.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1470_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1470_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-84333707,width-300,imgsize-116774,,resizemode-4,quality-100/meetings-agencies.jpg"}, {"caption": "c-SUITE", "id": "Economictime_PL_1470_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-84333751,quality-100/c-suite.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Rural, small town sales buoy consumer majors", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1490_News_0>Several top consumer goods makers said rural and small-town sales made a recovery in June, belying fears that these markets will take longer to pick up after the second wave that led to infection rates spiking in these areas too.Buoyant rural sales, along with the gradual opening up of markets and pent-up demand in cities, has helped several top companies such as Parle Products, Amul, Dabur, Emami, Xiaomi, Realme, HP and Panasonic clock 5-15% year-on-year growth in revenue in June, industry executives said. This is despite almost a third of the markets having been shut for most of the month due to the cautious easing of curbs.With several states lifting restrictions and local markets opening up, consumer demand is showing a sequential uptick, said Dabur India chief executive Mohit Malhotra. Rural markets will make a V-shaped recovery with the vaccination drive picking up pace, the government announcing stimulus measures and the monsoon expected to be normal, he said. <IMG Economictime_PL_1490_News_1>“Overall, demand growth is coming back to near-normal levels now, as the drop in Covid cases has boosted consumer sentiment,” said Malhotra, adding that the healthcare portfolio - chyawanprash, honey and immunity-building products - is doing particularly well in rural markets.Emami director Mohan Goenka said sales have recovered in rural markets, helping the company clock growth in June.Dependent on good monsoon“Things could have been better if the wholesale markets were fully operational,” said Goenka. “While we are relying on a good monsoon, there is still fear among rural consumers after the severe impact of the second wave and (with) several (workers) yet to migrate back to cities, (it’s) impacting remittances back home.”Rural and small-town markets are particularly important for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry since they contribute 55-60% to sales and drove growth after the first wave at more than twice the pace over urban areas, due to lower infection rates.Parle Products clocked low single-digit year-on-year growth in June despite April-June last year has been one of the biggest sales quarters for the country’s largest biscuit maker, said senior category head, Krishnarao Buddha. “There are no visible signs of a slowdown in consumption and July prospects should be better due to the monsoon, unless infection rate surges again,” he said.The country’s largest dairy brand, Amul, clocked a 15% growth in year-on-year sales in June.Consumer electronic sales buoyantSales of consumer electronic products such as smartphones, laptops, washing machines and refrigerators too have been buoyant in smaller towns and rural areas, which contribute 35-40% of total business, apart from pent-up demand in cities. Madhav Sheth, CEO at Realme India and Europe, said sales in June doubled over last year led by rural and small-town sales. A Xiaomi spokesperson said demand was high in June for recently launched smartphones. The company posted sales of Rs 200 crore within the first week of the launch of a new model, the spokesperson said. There has been a robust recovery in demand for personal computers and printers in June, said Gurpreet Singh Brar, director and head, channel sales, HP India.“In PCs, a strong bounce-back of demand is seen from students, gamers and gig workers, whereas the demand from large enterprises and small businesses continues to remain extremely buoyant as the second Covid wave has further accelerated digital transformation initiatives,” he said. In-home appliances, LG and Panasonic said consumers in rural markets continued to buy large-capacity models and premium products even as the second wave has abated.“This year, there is a gradual recovery in sales due to longer geography-specific containments, but we are going to clock 20% growth in June due to high demand for washing machines and ACs in the north,” said Panasonic India CEO Manish Sharma. Companies had better supply chain control with no major manufacturing disruptions this year, except for a few electronics makers voluntarily closing plants for a short period. This means there haven’t been any product shortages as happened during and after the first wave. Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala recently tweeted that despite the devastating effects of the second wave on lives, its economic impact hasn’t been as bad as anticipated. He said accelerated vaccination will lead to faster economic recovery.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/durables/rural-small-town-sales-buoy-consumer-majors/articleshow/84007122.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1490_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1490_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-84007136,width-300,imgsize-241742,,resizemode-4,quality-100/rising-shutter.jpg"}, {"caption": "22", "id": "Economictime_PL_1490_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-84007148,quality-100/22.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Zerodha gets Sebi’s in-principle nod to launch mutual fund business", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1545_News_0>Zerodha has received a licence from capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), to set up an Asset Management Company (AMC).The in-principle approval from Sebi will allow the Bengaluru-based startup to launch its own mutual funds (MFs), founder and chief executive Nithin Kamath tweeted on Wednesday.Zerodha is India’s largest retail broker by registered users.“So, we just got an in-principle approval for our AMC (MF) license. I guess now comes the hard part (sic),” Kamath tweeted.Zerodha had applied to the capital market regulator in February 2020, just months after Sebi allowed fintech firms to enter the MF business.A spokesperson for Zerodha did not offer comment.Flipkart cofounder Sachin Bansal’s fintech venture Navi has also received regulatory approval to launch its own AMC.In December 2019, Sebi eased regulations for fintech startups planning to enter the MF industry. It said entities with a net worth of ₹100 crore and five years of being profitable were eligible to sponsor MFs. AMCs should also maintain their minimum net worth continuously and not only towards the end of the year.“It’s a great move, no question. Zerodha had also applied for a licence, but Covid-19 slowed the market. We need more players to come to this market to foster innovation,” Kamath told ET in an interview in January, on Sebi’s relaxations.“The entry barrier has stopped many (from entering the MF industry). The problem with mutual funds today is that they are very complex for retail investors. With newer players coming in, I think the products will become simpler and innovative,” Kamath had said.The move comes at a time when Sebi has given approvals to firms such as Bajaj Finserv and discount broker Samco to launch MFs.Navi recently applied to Sebi to launch as many as 10 new MFs, all of which are set to be passively managed. These funds mirror the performance of an underlying index and typically do not need a fund manager.Zerodha has led the pack of new-age fintech brokers including Groww, Upstox and Paytm Money, which have seen strong traction on their platforms by retail investors as millions of Indians flocked to stock investments, attracted by the Nifty and the Sensex recording peaks repeatedly since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. <IMG Economictime_PL_1545_News_1>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/mf-news/zerodha-gets-sebis-in-principle-nod-to-launch-mf-business/articleshow/85847218.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1545_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath", "id": "Economictime_PL_1545_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85850942,width-300,imgsize-85463,,resizemode-4,quality-100/nikhil-kamath-zerodha-1200.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1545_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85847217,quality-100/.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Novavax set for India launch with Serum Institute as manufacturing partner", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1556_News_0>The uncertain path to authorisation in the US for Novavax despite passing the efficacy test with an impressive score of 90.4% might see India emerge as a major destination for the shots with the Serum Institute of India as manufacturing partner.The large Novavax trials conducted on 29,960 persons in the US and Mexico have delivered results that equal the Pfizer and Moderna jabs and do better than Johnson and Johnson, but regulatory clearance appears distant as an overflowing vault of vaccines has diminished the need for emergency use approvals. Under the US law, there is no need for additional EUAs once there are enough doses to cater to domestic needs.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1556_News_1>A report in NYT quotes Novavax chief executive Stanley Erck acknowledging that the first approvals for the vaccine are likely to be accorded abroad and that the company has applied in UK, EU, Korea and India. India can take a cue from the UK regulator but may proceed itself on the basis of strong interim data, Indian sources said. As per Indian government estimates, 20 crore Novavax shots (five crore a month) can be available during September-December and the number may rise.Novavax, named Covavax in India, is in advanced stages of Phase 2/3 “observer-blinded, randomised, active-controlled” bridging trials with SII enrolling 1,600 participants over 18 years across 15 centres. SII has also indicated an interest in conducting trials in children, official sources said. It may well be possible that India becomes the first country for the launch of the vaccine.“The results are very encouraging and we are looking forward to the vaccine. We are already engaged with SII for supplies and the company is doing trials with ICMR. It is a very promising vaccine candidate and we are hopeful that they will be able to submit data in India for regulatory approvals very soon,” an Indian official said. Seen as the fourth US vaccine, experts feel it has utility as a booster jab once it is necessary to renew or re-vaccinate people.Trials found it effective against the Alpha variant first found in Kent, though at a less efficacy of 86%. It reported a much lower 49% efficacy against the variant first found in South Africa. The shots were found to have milder after-effects.The sub-protein two-shot vaccine received a massive $ 1.6 billion assistance from the US government despite the company not having any previous record of developing shots that were marketed. Problems with some of its trials and hitches in manufacturing meant Novavax lost the race to Pfizer and Moderna and though it still remains in the EUA process, the firm may not press its case.The official said that the government is looking at an August-September timeline for the first lot of supplies of Covavax, if the regulatory processes advance smoothly. SII was considering applying for expedited authorisation under the Indian government’s revised norms if Novavax secures EUA in either UK or Europe.At a time when the demand for anti-Covid shots has begun to level off in the US with more than 50% of its population inoculated with at least one dose, Novavax vaccine with its high efficacy level is seen as a major breakthrough for developing countries that are vying for more doses to fast vaccinate their population. Experts feel India is strategically placed very well to gain, while it can also be a viable market for the American company to launch its product.“Like with Covaxin, US FDA has suggested Novavax to apply for full approval, which takes longer than an EUA. This means that a country outside the US may be the first to approve the vaccine. It could be India as well, with the indian version ‘Covavax’ getting fast track approvals,” says Oommen C Kurian, senior fellow, health initiative at ORF.Novavax is easy to store and transport, an important factor that may make it a good fit for India which is not only trying to ramp up its Covid-19 vaccination programme but is also faced with the challenge of taking it to remote corners.Novavax has initiated rolling review of its data with regulators in Europe, UK, Canada, Australia, among other countries. In January, the American biotechnology firm had announced that trials in Britain showed 96.4% efficacy against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus and 86.3% efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/novavax-set-for-india-launch-with-serum-institute-as-manufacturing-partner/articleshow/83533112.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1556_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Novavax Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective in US trial.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1556_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-83524061,width-300,imgsize-312280,,resizemode-4,quality-100/novavax.jpg"}, {"caption": "Page-1 Graphic-1 (8)", "id": "Economictime_PL_1556_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-83530843,quality-100/page-1-graphic-1-8.jpg"}]}

Several top brands are delaying or limiting the launch of some of their products to certain markets due to production issues, besides hiking prices, industry watchers say.“Some are delaying the launch or launching with a capped production and supply to meet the rising demand for smartphones and other electronics products,” Counterpoint Research analyst and partner Neil Shah said.The research firm expects the year to end with about 190 launches compared with 207-plus in 2020. There have so far been 103 launches this year. The festival season, which spans from September till December end, is the main sale period both online and offline, accounting for roughly a third of annual sales.The delays come on the back of shortages in parts like power management integrated circuits along with the rising cost for key components such as memory, processors and logistics.Jio Platforms, the digital arm of Reliance Industries, has delayed the launch of its “affordable” smartphone from September 10 to around Diwali (November). The company is targeting more than 300 million feature phone customers with the new phone, being designed with Google.“This additional time will also help mitigate the current industry-wide, global semiconductor shortages,\" the company had said in a statement. <IMG Economictime_PL_1572_News_1>Supply-side challenges have already forced smartphone market tracking firms to start cutting their 2021 shipment estimates by 5-10% for the second time this year, with the import curbs at airports and ports in China adding to the woes of the brands already plagued by the continuing acute shortage of chipsets.Analysts expect some launches to be restricted to limited geographies.\"Smartphone brands have been adopting various strategies to cope with the current short supply, including price rises or limited geographic launches,\" said Prabhu Ram, head-industry intelligence group at CMR.Jio Phone Next was estimated to be priced at Rs 3,500-4,000. Analysts say the delay will not cause a complete washout if the digital firm manages to meet the festival deadline.“Jio is also not immune to this as it has delayed launch of the much anticipated JioPhone Next, but hopefully not miss the Diwali holiday season as it is staring at a potential of half a billion user base still not owning a smartphone,” Shah said.Meanwhile, some analysts say the supply chain issues were getting ironed out and larger smartphone makers would not push back their launches.“Other brands have been steadily improving their shipments and numbers will certainly be lesser than 2020 but we should not expect more delayed launches.

This is despite an 8-12% surge in prices since December for these two categories due to increase in commodity prices, components and surge in ocean freight.However, on a full-year basis, AC and refrigerator sales declined by 20-30% in 2020 over 2019 due to loss of the crucial summer, with March to June accounting for 50-65% of their annual sales.<IMG Economictime_PL_1617_News_1>The industry has to reduce dependency on China with the government making it clear to be self-reliant with hike in import levies, said Pradeep Bakshi, MD of Voltas, India’s largest AC maker.

India imports almost 30% of ACs sold in the country. Some companies are still importing but have set up lines to fill the refrigerant in the country.LG India vice president Vijay Babu said the company has expanded capacity since it expects a huge boost in sales this summer. The country’s largest appliance maker has expanded AC capacity by almost 35% and refrigerators by 10% to build the pipeline before the season.Blue Star’s managing director B Thiagarajan said every company would want to invest to make the most of the PLI scheme and “we can expect at least Rs 1,000 crore investment by the industry every year now.” The company has lined up Rs 200 crore expansion apart from projects on localisation due to import restrictions.All companies including LG, Samsung, Voltas, Daikin, Blue Star and Panasonic have lined up their highest-ever new model launches in both AC and refrigerators this summer.The industry expects more curbs on imports as part of the government’s self-reliant Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiatives. Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi said the industry has also proposed phased manufacturing programmes to set a timeline to import restrictions and build local capacity.According to a recent report by Equirus, pent-up demand along with price increases should lead to significant volume and value growth for AC makers in 2021-22.

Typically, a full unit of the ECU for the diesel engine is priced around Rs 60,000-70,000. In August, about 1,500 units of the model could be produced and the number might rise to 3,200 in September 2021. The company is targeting peak production of 240 per day from October and November. The company is still facing supply chain issues to ramp up Thar volumes to the target of 100-120 per day, sources said.An email sent to Mahindra & Mahindra on the adjustment in its production plans did not elicit any response. In a recent interview to ET after the unveiling of the XUV 700, Rajesh Jejurikar, ED, Mahindra & Mahindra, said pandemic curbs and chip shortages are short term disruptions.“We can’t change our long term strategy due to short term disruptions. So we have to go ahead, manage the situation and adjust with the new world of disruptions. There may be some short term challenges; we will deal with them as we go along,” added Jejurikar.Jejurikar declined to share any specific number or indication on the shortages that the company is facing on XUV 700, but at the earnings conference call, he had shared that if not for the shortage of semiconductors, the company would have sold 20-30% more.On the preparation for XUV 700 launch, Jejurikar, said: “We have proactively created capacity for XUV 700 in the current scenario. What is uncertain right now is the semiconductor supply. That is something we will watch out closely and address on priority.”Already, vehicle makers such as Ford, Renault Nissan and Maruti Suzuki have been compelled to take production holidays or plant shutdowns due to the shortages in semiconductor supplies.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-components/chip-shortage-may-hit-mms-diesel-xuv-700-launch-plan/articleshow/85606326.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1622_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In a recent interview to ET after the unveiling of the XUV 700, Rajesh Jejurikar, ED, Mahindra & Mahindra, said pandemic curbs and chip shortages are short-term disruptions.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1622_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85613312,width-300,imgsize-84389,,resizemode-4,quality-100/mahindra-mahindra-rolls-out-suv-xuv700-at-rs-11-99-lakh.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1622_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85606324,quality-100/.jpg"}]}

The integration of Complan after the acquisition by Zydus is also underway.While Nestle is re-launching Milo, the world's largest malted food drinks brand, Danone said it has nearly a dozen new products in its pipeline, like low sugar variants, bar and ready-to-drink versions of its health brand Protinex.“We have been launching about 10 products every year but the numbers we are evaluati ng this year are far higher and aggressive. In terms of concept, we are testing nearly 20-25 new products but now the chance of success is much higher,” said Himanshu Bakshi, managing director at Danone India. “For us, it’s expanding the market rather than fighting for space as the household penetration of protein is very low.”The Indian nutraceuticals market is currently worth $4 billion and is expected to grow at 21% to reach $10 billion by 2022. Many mainstream fast moving consumer goods companies have been entering the market, mostly in the functional food category. HUL had earlier said that it could look at entering the nutritional and high protein segments through Horlicks while Marico launched protein shakes under Saffola Fittify a few months ago. <IMG Economictime_PL_1629_News_1> Danone’s Protinex, originally into the niche high protein nutritional segment, has launched mainstream variants such as mango and kesar badam and also entered the biscuit segment over the past few months. While GSK controls more than half the country’s health food drinks category worth ?6,500 crore, rival Mondelez, that owns Bournvita and Abbott, maker of Pediasure and Ensure, has been increasing market share over the past one year.Nestle’s global malt-based drink Milo in India is being relaunched as an energy drink for sports, which analysts feel could capture the gap created during GSK and Complan’s integration. “It is purely coincidental that this is happening in an environment where GSK Consumer and Unilever are merging.

Dr Reddy's started importing the vaccine in May and initiated a soft launch in Hyderabad on May 14. Private hospitals had expected a commercial launch on June 20, said people aware of the matter.The vaccine is, however, being available in a limited manner this week in private hospitals in state capitals including Patna, Lucknow, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, along with Delhi and Gurgaon. Slots are being offered on alternate days in Fortis Memorial Research Centre in Gurgaon and Batra Hospital in Delhi, among others. Jai Prabha Medanta Hospital in Patna, Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, Narayana Hrudayalaya in Bengaluru, as well as Apollo and Basavatarakam hospitals in Hyderabad.However, some facilities aren't rolling out the vaccine even with these limited stocks, as they have not got second doses, said people with knowledge of the matter.Unlike Serum Institute of India's Covishield and Bharat Biotech-made Covaxin, the composition of the Sputnik V second dose is different from the first and cannot be administered from the same vial. The gap between the two doses is shortest for Sputnik, at 21 days.\"We have not received the second dose, so we are not launching even in a limited manner as we are not assured of the second dose supply. We do not want our beneficiaries to panic,\" a senior healthcare professional at one of the hospitals told ET. The delays come amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in Russia this month.This is unlikely to affect the government's immunisation drive as Sputnik V is not currently part of it. Health ministry sources told ET that it's unlikely to be included and offered at government facilities until production starts in India, possibly in August. Sputnik V, developed by Moscow-based Gamaleya National Research Institute, is being distributed in India by Dr Reddy's. The first shipment of Sputnik V was received in May. <IMG Economictime_PL_1651_News_1>Fortis Healthcare introduced the vaccine in a limited manner at its hospitals in Gurgaon and Mohali on Friday. Over the past four days, about 1,200 persons have been inoculated. Since this was a \"soft pilot launch,\" the two sites offered just 100-150 doses per day. When asked whether it had second dose supplies, a Fortis spokesperson said, \"The citizens who have been vaccinated with Sputnik V will be administered their second dose as per the schedule.\"Dr Reddy's said it has used May-June to scale up the soft launch and test its cold storage facilities as the vaccine needs to be maintained at -18 degrees Celsius.\"Our cold storage and other logistical arrangements are being executed in line with our commercialisation plan and are on track, with no issues,\" the company told ET. \"We have partnered with major hospitals all over the country.

The idea is to bring the cost down in countries where the import tariffs are high. It is looking at partners who could share the investment and offer local expertise in such markets.Under its vision RE 2.0, newly appointed chief executive Vinod Dasari expects international markets to account for 20% of total revenue. It is targeting another 20% from apparels, accessories and other services, and 60% from the domestic market. This is an attempt to spread risk and eye new business avenues to grow business, Dasari said.More than 90% of Enfield’s sales are from India by selling one type of motorcycle, Dasari said, adding that his emphasis would be on diversifying the revenue base and tapping into new opportunities.“We will continue to bring in many more products. But I want to have faster growth on solutions and I want to have faster growth internationally. So, we’re going to invest a lot in both these things,” he told ET.The company has classified global markets into three categories — India-like markets, mature markets and long-shot markets — and devised strategies that cater specifically to each category in terms of products, sales and business models. It plans to launch one new product, including variants, every quarter for the coming three to four years. <IMG Economictime_PL_1669_News_1> For example, for popular tourist destinations, like Morocco, it has a tie-up with rental companies to develop ridership among travellers and create an aspiration for the brand in the long run. There will be markets where the 350cc Classic motorcycle may be the core offering, and the evolved markets of Europe and the US where it will be the Twins.As against a footprint of 900 stores in India, Enfield has already expanded its global presence to 600 stores over the past five years. <IMG Economictime_PL_1669_News_2> Led by higher acceptability of 650cc models — Interceptor and Continental GT — its exports have grown 125% to 26,621 units in the first eight months (April-November) of fiscal 2020. The share of exports in the overall business increased to 5.51% from 2.06% in this period. Almost half the Twin 650cc models produced by the company are shipped abroad. Encouraging response to the Twins has resulted in a waiting time of 3-4 months in most markets. In the UK, the Interceptor 650 has emerged the highest selling motorcycle in the ‘Naked Street’ category.According to CLSA, the company’s export volume was expected to grow at 35.2% annually between FY17 and FY22 and the share of export was likely to reach 7.25%.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/royal-enfield-gets-ready-to-go-deeper-into-markets-abroad/articleshow/72376621.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1669_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "According to CLSA, the company’s export volume was expected to grow at 35.2% annually between FY17 and FY22 .", "id": "Economictime_PL_1669_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-72376654,width-300,imgsize-296528,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_1669_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-72376639,quality-100/2.jpg"}, {"caption": "3", "id": "Economictime_PL_1669_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-72376642,quality-100/3.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Semiconductor crunch throws auto sector out of gear, cos staring at 100,000 units of production loss in July-Sept quarter", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1679_News_0>The impact of the second wave of the pandemic on the automobile industry may have disappeared, but that of the semiconductor shortage lingers.Maruti Suzuki may have to reduce its production plans for this year by 5% if the shortage continues, people in the know said. That would be an output loss of 70,000-80,000 units, or more than ₹4,600 crore, at the market leader.A 5% impact on Maruti Suzuki’s volumes would mean a 2.5% hit on production in India’s passenger vehicle segment, since the company makes half the cars and SUVs sold in the country.Shortage of chips that are an integral part of new-age vehicles is a global phenomenon, and almost every automaker is suffering. In India, the industry is estimating the total production loss due to this in the July-September quarter alone to be close to 100,000 units, even as it is sitting on a huge backlog of orders.This shortage is so severe that Renault and Nissan suspended production for a day at their alliance plant near Chennai on Tuesday. Industry executives are expecting more such shutdowns in the coming months.At Maruti Suzuki, rationalisation of production at the Gujarat plant of parent Suzuki Motor in August will affect the supply of its key volume drivers — the Baleno, Swift and Dzire models, the people said. <IMG Economictime_PL_1679_News_1>“These are uncertain times of semiconductor shortage and in the best interest of our shareholders, whenever felt appropriate we provide guidance on any such impact and also duly inform of production suspension if any,” a Maruti Suzuki spokesperson told ET. Suzuki Motor Sees Shortage till FY22 End  Maruti Suzuki’s parent, Suzuki Motor Corp (SMC) of Japan, has guided for low double-digit volume growth for its Indian operations when it released its first volume forecast for the current fiscal year. This was less than half the 25-30% growth expected by analysts in India. Suzuki Motor has forecast its total automobile sales to grow 5.5% to 2.71 million units in FY21 (which is FY22 in India), out of which Asia is expected to grow by 11% to 1.72 million units. India, which accounts for 90% of its Asia sales, too is predicted to grow 11%.Second wave also factored inBased on this guidance, the Indian operation is likely to deliver an output of 1.62 million in the current fiscal year. This is significantly lower than the tentative production plan of around 1.9-2 million units shared by the company with its vendors. The new forecast takes into account the production loss due to the second wave as well as the chip shortage.Suzuki’s guidance is based on the expectation that the shortage of semiconductors will continue till the end of the current fiscal year.According to a Credit Suisse report, SMC’s management guidance appears to be factored in the negative impact of 350,000 units in global sales due to semiconductor supply shortage, of which 250,000 units are in Japan and remaining overseas. Given that India’s contribution is 75-80% of volume outside Japan, it would mean the chip shortage could potentially hit volume of around 75,000 units.Suzuki Motor Gujarat’s production loss in August is estimated at 11,000-12,000 units, worth Rs 500-700 crore. The production plan for September has already been revised downwards.‘Overwhelming Demand’At Renault-Nissan, output of the recently launched SUV models Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite is hit by 20-40% because of the chip shortage. The companies are sitting on bookings in excess of 20,000 units on each of these models, but their deliveries are getting delayed.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/semiconductor-crunch-throws-auto-production-out-of-gear/articleshow/85227628.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1679_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1679_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85227628,width-300,imgsize-43466,,resizemode-4,quality-100/.jpg"}, {"caption": "cars", "id": "Economictime_PL_1679_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-85229306,quality-100/cars.jpg"}]}

Tata could team up with the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), the government’s key R&D organisation, to carry out clinical trials of Moderna’s vaccine candidate in India, officials familiar with the development said.Foreign vaccine companies must conduct a bridging trial in India before launching their products in the country. Even if the vaccines are approved outside India, foreign companies must conduct phase-3 trials with Indian volunteers. Moderna received funding in January 2020 from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is part of the COVAX facility of the World Health Organization, to develop its mRNA vaccine against the Covid-19 virus. The COVAX facility aims to equitably distribute 2 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses in low-and middle-income countries including India by the end of 2021. <IMG Economictime_PL_1730_News_1>Moderna will also supply its vaccine to these countries. Exploratory talks have started between Tata Medical & Diagnostics and Moderna and concrete plans will be finalised once government approvals for private sector participation come in, top officials said. Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Tata Sons did not respond to emailed queries from ET.Tata Medical & Diagnostics was set up in June last year in the midst of the pandemic and is keen to tap the country’s Covid-19-led health requirements in the devices and formulations space, officials said. \"The requirement for vaccines in India will be huge and the Tata Group has a strong brand equity in the country to gain people’s trust and confidence by following approved guidelines for vaccines,\" a top group official said.Private companies are waiting for directions from the government on the kind of role they can play in the nation’s vaccination programme, one of the largest globally. Companies in the country with international tie-ups for testing and supplying Covid-19 vaccines include Serum Institute of India for the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca; Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, and Biological E for Johnson & Johnson’s candidate. Domestic companies working to develop or manufacture vaccine formulations include Bharat Biotech, Zydus Cadila and Hetero Biopharma. Tata Medical & Diagnostics started in the Covid-19 space by signing up with the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, CSIR’s constituent lab, for licensing of knowhow for a rapid diagnosis test to be deployed as early as end of May.Moderna has no separate tieup with Indian manufacturers yet and its first supply commitments are to governments that pre-ordered vaccines. The US company’s vaccine has been approved for use in countries including the US, Canada and the UK.

Netflix will feature a 'Play Something' button underneath the user's profile name, the navigation menu and the tenth row on the service's homepage. When one clicks on this button, the service will choose a brand new series or a movie personalised to the user's tastes and watch history to immediately start playing that title on the screen. In case the title is not interesting, users will have an option to skip to the next title. <IMG Economictime_PL_1750_News_1>Netflix has been testing this feature with select users for more than a year and has gone through multiple iterations, said Cameron Johnson, Director of Product Innovation, Netflix. In January, Netflix had stated plans to roll out this feature globally in the first half of 2021.\"When you click play something, it will always play a show that you haven't watched before. It's designed for the moment when you want to watch something new, since we realized that's a hard choice for people,\" Johnson said. An earlier iteration of this test, which was less successful, had included newer episodes of series the user has already started or watched, he said. <IMG Economictime_PL_1750_News_2>\"We realized that if people want to just watch the next episode of the show that they are already excited about, it's generally really easy for them to do, they go and find that show and watch the next episode,\" Johnson said. \"We have some further experimentations to understand how much should we base it on what you've watched before, or how much variety we should include in the suggestions.\"Over the years, Netflix has explored different ways to improve content discovery on its platform. This includes Snapchat Stories-inspired previews, automatic downloads feature on mobile apps, and improved user interfaces for its television apps among others.This is crucial for the streaming giant as it ramps up content programming on its service. Netflix plans to spend over $17 billion on content in 2021, the company said in its latest earnings report earlier this month.In India, Netflix competes with players like Disney+Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, Essel Group's Zee5, Times Internet's MX Player, Sony Pictures Network's SonyLIV, Viacom18's Voot, and Reliance-backed ALT Balaji among others.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/netflix-launches-play-something-feature-to-help-users-what-to-watch/articleshow/82294348.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1750_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1750_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-82294360,width-650,imgsize-66521,,resizemode-4,quality-100/netflix.jpg"}, {"caption": "Netflix TV Profiles", "id": "Economictime_PL_1750_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-82294355,quality-100/netflix-tv-profiles.jpg"}, {"caption": "Netflix Play Something", "id": "Economictime_PL_1750_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-82294381,quality-100/netflix-play-something.jpg"}]}

{"title": "OnePlus against cheapening products, can't disrespect loyal customers: Carl Pei", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1787_News_0>  Q: How have you seen the Indian handset market evolve in the last few years?  It may sound naïve, but for us it is not the macro trends that matter so much but that we follow through on our strategy, vision and keep improving ourselves. When we started, there were no great android phones in the market.  Back in the day, in 2013-iPhones were so much better than android so we said hey, let us make better Android phones and focus on user experience. Not on feature and decorations that people do not really need and that is what we have been doing.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1787_News_1>   A lot of people ask us that who are your competitors, why do you not make cheaper phones and increase market share but for us it is sticking to our original vision-which was to create the best flagship phone and keep improving upon that. We have a long way to go in improving ourselves, strength of our team and how we deliver these products.  Focusing on this is going to bring us much more success than analyzing market trends. However, India markets have changed and online market is huge. We have been lucky enough to capture it and IDC numbers say we have 50% of the market but that was never our goal - that we need X amount of market share. The goal should always be to make great products, serve your customers well no matter which industry you follow. It is impossible to be successful if you have great products and people love you.  Q: What would be the growth factors that you see propelling you in India?  On the micro/macro level we have to keep making good products and this way our brand will gain trust in the market and people will be more and more willing to recommend our product to friends and family. Word of mouth has been the biggest growth lever for us.  If you look at our user survey, how did you hear about OnePlus -friends and family is always first. This does not happen through marketing, but when someone buys the product and is satisfied with it. In India we have been experimenting with offline and have started our experience store in Bengaluru. It has got the highest revenue in the entire street out of all the stores.  Building this experience stores has increased our sales in Bengaluru versus taking any other sales online. Now that we have launched store, people thought online sales will be impacted but our online sales have done very well and experience store sales too. We did this experiment with Croma too, where it started as small experiment but bow expanding into more and more Croma shops. So that is something we will keep looking into.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1787_News_2>   Q: You have been betting also on offline stores in India? why this mix?  When we first entered the country, there were many multiple brand servicing outlets. We went to many service centres and realised this was not great or staff was not trained well. We said ok, if we were to do this ourselves then how could it be done. We tried to open ESC-exclusive service centre and in few months, it absorbed 40% of the city's sales, despite us having multi brand service centres. This told us that if the user experience is good, people will be willing to go to ESC.  Q: Would you want to increase the number of offline stores?  We are very excited about this, but it is not something that we can comment on.  Q: You are trying to duplicate in Europe the success story of exclusive sales via Amazon  We shipped globally in the very beginning but did not ship to India. We did not know how India worked back then, there were customs and it was a long process so we did not launch in India. After launching globally, we started getting lot of enquiries from India.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1787_News_3>   At the beginning 25% of our enquiries came in not from users who we sold the phone to but, from Indian consumers complaining that we did not launch in India saying that India is one of the biggest smartphone markets in the world and they would love to see our products there.  We decided to go to India in August 2014 and there we had an event where we scattered our fans in a cafe in Bengaluru and to our surprise 60-70 showed up and good 40-50 were using OnePlus Ones. We were quite surprised since we had not sold a single phone in the country.  We looked at data and saw that of the 7000 odd phones we sold in US, some had shipping address in US but billing addresses were from India. So that means customers were buying our phones for their Indian relatives and this made us realise that we have to go to India. This led us to meet Amazon and they had figured out how to enter India.  Amit Agarwal, India head of Amazon and we discussed on company cultures where customer is first and make everything work around it. It was easy for us to start working together and if we are aligned on values then teams can figure out the rest of business. Other e-commerce players were focus on short term values and margins and we could not connect with them.  Couple of months ago, I told Amit if we can replicate our success with Amazon in India and Europe as well. Europe is different since unlike India, where more buy phones online, in Europe bundled packs are easily available. Amit connected us with Amazon Europe to get pan European deal going and we have announced our partnerships with Amazon France, Spain, Germany and Italy.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1787_News_4>   Q: What will make the new OnePlus work in Indian markets amidst all cash back offers, discounts on smartphones?  We have some offers as EMI but we do not offer much cash backs and so far, it has been working out very well. We are very much against cheapening our product and lowering price of the product specially, after the launch. It does not show confidence or respect to your earlier customers.  People who buy your products first are your most loyal advocates and these are the guys you should not let down. So, we tend to not lower the price and only if the phone is about half a year or a year old then we can consider doing it. Frequent price drops are not good for the brand or customers and it impacts the second-hand value.  Q: There is a special Avengers series along with the new OnePlus for Indian markets. Why was that step taken?  Avengers series we are launching in China and India. In India we are mature in the development stage as a brand, while in the western markets we are in the enthusiastic stage of the brand.  People there know OnePlus is a good smartphone whereas in India we have gone beyond and it is an aspirational brand of sorts. So, with that it becomes easier to negotiate with partners and looking at things in India a bit differently. We are also testing out of home advertising in India since brand is at a more advanced stage.   Q: Where is the company on sourcing locally, after the government's move to impose BCD on PCB assembly?  Manufacturing locally is more relevant to business press and industry but not end consumer who just needs a good product. For OnePlus 5T, more than 90% is locally manufactured and we need to do this since we also need to observe and react to the government policies. Also, lot of impact happens on margins if you manufacture locally versus importing.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1787_News_5>   Q: Data privacy and security concerns have never been more important. Will the company relocate its data serves to India keeping in mind security issues?  Data security is a trend everyone is watching globally. Here in Europe we have GDPR coming in to full affect later this month, Indian government is also looking at it and in China, there is a draft regarding cyber privacy laws. We need to be very careful since our community is very engaged and internet savvy.  So, in a way we are under a microscope so anything we do is looked at with scrutiny by our community and for us we need to pay attention to this part. After company goes through GDPR process, we have to be fully GDPR compliant since we have teams based in Europe. Right now, GDPR is the most stringent out of all government regulations in terms of privacy requirements. So, if we are ok with GDPR then, we will also be ok in China and India.  Since beginning we knew people are concerned about where their data is stored so we have it in Amazon's AWS which is US based servers since beginning and I think we are going to be quite ok at this point. We have discussed (on getting data servers to India) but we have not made a call yet. Our Chinese data centres are in China but global ones are in US.  Q: India is the largest market for OnePlus, having accounted for over 40% of its global sales of $1.4-billion in 2017, when its global sales had doubled. What kind of growth you expect to see this year?  Growth will depend on whether we can male products and although we have targets those are not most important for us. We are looking at being healthy and that is the key word. Since as a business you need to remain healthy.  For a company it also means being profitable. We will not chase growth at the risk of not making money. We will choose slow and stay and healthy growth versus numbers. Net promoter score (NPS) of products is what we are looking at us. If you choose only next quarter results and optimise your strategies towards it, it is easy to take company in the wrong direction. You risk becoming like everyone else  Q. You have been betting also on offline stores in India? Why this mix?  We look at the country. In China, more than 20% of the phones are sold online where as in India it is around 30% whereas in US and Europe it is less than 10%. So that will help us guide our strategy since if market has more than 30% online sales then that will help us achieve volume. But if no one buys online, we need alternative strategy like in Europe -Finland, Denmark, UK we need to act differently and work with operators. It is about how we do right in one market from another than just competition.  Q. What are the challenges you see in Indian markets? <IMG Economictime_PL_1787_News_6>  It is ourselves and we have a long way to go. I am only 28 years old and we started 4 years ago, I knew nothing about leading a team or run a company. In the beginning, everything went well. We had a good product, we got lucky but after the first stage of euphoria, there comes a trough and disillusionment when you realise that your early success is not because you are a special snowflake but you were lucky.  Then you need to work on internal skills to become better at what you are doing. So, for me it is leadership skills or presentation skills or whatever that may be. The more we improve internally, harder it is to touch us. We do not look at what competition is doing. I will give us 2.5 out of 10 if we have to rate ourselves internally. We still have 7.5 of potential to achieve.  Our team and leadership we all need to improve. We are quite confident of our strategy. People had asked us if we need to make cheaper phones but we do not know how to do that. We need to make more marketing campaigns that are loved by consumers, we can run stores better and run our partnerships with Amazon and Croma better. There is always room to improve.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei/articleshow/64206803.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-64207239,width-650,imgsize-173354,,resizemode-4,quality-100/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei.jpg"}, {"caption": "OnePlus against cheapening products, can't disrespect loyal customers: Carl Pei", "id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64207146,quality-100/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei.jpg"}, {"caption": "OnePlus against cheapening products, can't disrespect loyal customers: Carl Pei", "id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64207138,quality-100/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei.jpg"}, {"caption": "OnePlus against cheapening products, can't disrespect loyal customers: Carl Pei", "id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64207151,quality-100/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei.jpg"}, {"caption": "OnePlus against cheapening products, can't disrespect loyal customers: Carl Pei", "id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64207155,quality-100/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei.jpg"}, {"caption": "OnePlus against cheapening products, can't disrespect loyal customers: Carl Pei", "id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News_5", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64207245,quality-100/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei.jpg"}, {"caption": "OnePlus against cheapening products, can't disrespect loyal customers: Carl Pei", "id": "Economictime_PL_1787_News_6", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64207156,quality-100/oneplus-against-cheapening-products-cant-disrespect-loyal-customers-carl-pei.jpg"}]}

{"title": "What pet insurance covers, how much it costs and the products on offer", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1801_News_0>Last year, Bengaluru-based Meenakshi Kohli spent nearly Rs 30,000 on the surgery of her Labrador, who had ingested a plastic bottle, resulting in gastro-intestinal blockage. It was then that she decided to buy a Rs 60,000 cover from Vetina Pawtect at Rs 3,924 a year.This care and concern for pets, especially dogs, marks the successful transition of Indians from pet owners 10 years ago, to pet parents now. With higher disposable incomes, an increasing number of people are keeping and spending on pets: dogs as pets numbered 214 lakh in 2019, while there were 18 lakh pet cats, as per Statista. Little wonder then that India is the fastest growing pet care market in the world, according to Petext India Rs 21. It is expected to grow at 14% a year to reach $490 million (Rs 3,618 crore) by 2022.This may also be the reason that pet insurance, a thriving industry abroad, is beginning to take off in India. “There has always been insurance for cattle and livestock, but with people spending Rs 70,000-80,000 a year on dogs, insurance for these pets is now picking up,” says Tarun Mathur, CBO, General Insurance and Cofounder, Policybazaar.What is covered?While insurers such as New India Assurance, United India Insurance and Oriental Insurance have been selling cattle insurance for years, new players have joined the race. Vetina Healthcare, in collaboration with Digit Insurance, launched Pawtect medical cover in 2018, while Bajaj Allianz General Insurance started offering insurance for dogs in August 2020. Though the public sector insurers offer only protection against death, the private players are covering both death and disease.“Since 85% of Indian pet market is dominated by dogs, we decided to start with covers for dogs,” says T.A.Ramalingam, Chief Technical Officer, Bajaj Allianz. “We offer two primary covers for surgeries and hospitalisation, while there are six optional covers or riders, including OPD, terminal diseases care, lost or stolen dogs, and third-party liability,” he adds. Pawtect does not cover stolen or lost dogs and has no OPD cover. Oriental, besides death due to accident or disease, also covers entry fees for show dogs, and worldwide transit, and its coverage is similar to that of New India Assurance.Pet covers on offer <IMG Economictime_PL_1801_News_1>What is the cost?All insurers typically require some form of identification at the time of applying for the cover and can vary from colour photo and nose print to photo of microchip or RFID tag.Exclusions & limitationsInsurers typically have a waiting period of 15-30 days before the cover starts, and the age limit for the pet is 8 weeks to 8 years, other than Bajaj Allianz, whose entry and exit ages vary from 3 months to 10 years. There is also a co-pay or deductible imposed by all insurers: 10% for surgery and hospitalisation in case of Bajaj Allianz; 20% of the dog’s market value or sum insured, for Oriental and New India Assurance. In case of Pawtect, if the pet is less than eight years old, Rs 1,000 or 5% of payable amount (whichever is higher) will be deducted. If it is over eight years old, 75% of admissible amount will be paid and 50% if the pet is over 10 years. Pre-existing diseases are also not covered by insurers, as are specific illnesses like distemper and rabies, which result in death of the pet.So, should you buy a cover for your pet? “It is definitely advisable as people are spending more and more on pets these days. They not only cost more, but the medical costs are also rising, with an average surgery easily costing Rs 20-30,000,” says Mathur.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/insure/other-risk-covers/what-pet-insurance-covers-how-much-it-costs-and-the-products-on-offer/articleshow/79579735.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1801_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Though the public sector insurers offer only protection against death, the private players are covering both death and disease.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1801_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-79579748,width-300,imgsize-111638,,resizemode-4,quality-100/copetins.jpg"}, {"caption": "co9in", "id": "Economictime_PL_1801_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79579756,quality-100/co9in.jpg"}]}

With Jio, Airtel, Vi working towards it, companies across the board are preparing for it. Reliance Jio has confirmed that its 5G Core network and 5G radio have a network bandwidth of 1 Gbps. With such speeds, data consumption is bound to increase dramatically and transform the way we do our daily talks at work and in our personal lives. The Change 5G Will Bring“In 2021, we’ll see near-term benefits in mobile, especially with the deployment of 5G networks this year — which will accelerate globally. The fast speeds and low latencies will enable people to truly multitask with their phones as the hub. Further ahead in the next few years, we’ll see 5G enable new and improved telemedicine, tele-learning, and virtual entertainment. Already, the pandemic has forced us to embrace these, but it’s clear that the optimal infrastructure isn’t there. As 5G becomes a reality and the cultural shift toward social distancing lingers, we could see it enabling 4K/8K high-resolution video for telemedicine, personalized AI-based teachers in virtual classrooms, and lag-free Zoom meetings. In 2021 and beyond, 5G might power inventive contactless experiences in retail and hospitality, and interactive sporting and entertainment experiences.” says Anand Ramamoorthy, MD, Micron TechnologyGeographic Information System MappingHERE Technologies which works in the area of geospatial engineering and innovation and has clients such as Volvo cars, BMW, Audi, Daimler apart from public sector clients is launching new products and solutions in anticipation of 5G.

In Agriculture, 5G could enable the adoption of autonomous vehicles, drones and real time data collection for better management of crops and livestock,” says Agendra Kumar, President, Esri IndiaStandardized Platforms and Processes According to Red Hat, to build future proof 5G Networks it will be imperative to move away from traditional monolithic and vertically locked-in architectures to adopting agile and open architecture frameworks of Network design using opensource software for standardised, automated cloud platform designs which are homogenous across IT, Network and enterprise workloads - “Core to the Edge” “Red Hat’s view for the deploying 5G networks is synonymous to our Open Hybrid Cloud vision. These NextGen networks will be built for scale, resilience, low latency, interoperability, automation, hybrid and modular design, reduced time to market and ultimately end user experience. Therefore it will be imperative to adopt a horizontal cloud & a cloud native first or ready approach for any / all network designs and deployments ensuring a common platform, management layer and standardized processes from core to edge. Red Hat OpenShift is the our 5G foundation platform, a consistent and common infrastructure across the compute, storage and network footprint with automated provisioning, management and orchestration to simplify operations” says Marshal Correia, Vice President and General Manager, India, South Asia at Red HatIncreasing CapacityWithout doubt 5G rollout and implementation will call for rethinking of data centre design. As a result of this, there will be need for creating higher-performance IoT infrastructures within our organization. At Hitachi Systems Micro Clinic, the plan is to increase data centre capacity by incorporating mixed computing architectures such as enhanced storage, backup, and recovery options. The company’s focus will be on performance while maintaining full IT capacity for our customersIT Infrastructure“The launch of 5G will bring agility for end users which will further drive growth in network connectivity and IT infra support. The need for Cloud migration will become a priority for Enterprises to cater to the sudden spike in demand. At the same time, 5G poses an elevated security threat partly because there are more vectors through which adversaries now can attack. The technology will enable IoT which will lead to rise in the number of devices and thus exposure of more nodes to threat,” says Anuj Gupta, CEO, Hitachi Systems Micro Clinic.

The 296 GTB is Ferrari's third hybrid to go into series production, which excludes limited-edition vehicles. It follows the SF 90 Stradale in 2019 and a convertible version, the SF90 Spider, last year. Ferrari Chief Marketing and Commercial officer Enrico Galliera said the 296 GTB created a new segment. \"If the SF 90 was designed to reach the peak of performance, this has been designed for the peak of pleasure of driving,\" he said in a web presentation. \"We expect this will also help us attract clients who are not driving a Ferrari now.\" The two-seater will cost 269,000 euros ($321,000), reaching 302,000 euros for it \"Assetto Fiorano\" high-performance version. It will have a top speed over 330 km per hour (205 mph). The Italian company known worldwide for its prancing horse logo and red racing cars has promised its first full electric model in 2025. \"It's a process which has started a couple of years ago,\" Galliera said. \"We're working to cope with regulation and the task of reducing emissions.\" <IMG Economictime_PL_1807_News_1> Ferrari and its rivals are wrestling with how to shift their line-ups to battery power without losing the high performance that supports their premium pricing. Porsche, part of the Volkswagen group, already offers a full-electric vehicle with its Taycan model, but Ferrari is ahead of its arch-rival Lamborghini, also part of Volkswagen, whose first full-electric car will not appear until the second half of this decade. To drive into the new era of electrification, Ferrari has picked technology industry veteran Benedetto Vigna as its new chief executive. The 296 GTB will be fitted with a 6-cylinder (V6) mid-rear turbo engine, the first on a road car with a Ferrari badge, although such engines have roots dating back to the 1950s in Ferrari racing cars. Ferrari road cars are normally powered by V8 or more powerful - but also more polluting - V12 engines. Still, the V6 engine, coupled with a 122 KW electric motor, can produce a massive 830 horse power. Like the SF90 Stradale, it can deliver 25 km of silent electric-only power. First deliveries are expected in the first quarter of 2022, starting from Europe. The 296 GTB is the third of three cars Ferrari has promised for this year. Its first ever SUV, called Purosangue (Thoroughbred), is expected next year.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/luxe-on-wheels-ferrari-launches-hybrid-sports-car-296-gtb-at-320k-in-a-bid-to-go-electric/articleshow/83835897.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1807_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The two-seater will cost 269,000 euros ($321,000), reaching 302,000 euros for it 'Assetto Fiorano' high-performance version.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1807_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-83836009,width-650,imgsize-639900,,resizemode-4,quality-100/the-two-seater-will-cost-269000-euros-321000-reaching-302000-euros-for-it-assetto-fiorano-high-performance-version-.jpg"}, {"caption": "The 296 GTB will be fitted with a 6-cylinder (V6) mid-rear turbo engine, the first on a road car with a Ferrari badge", "id": "Economictime_PL_1807_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-83836025,quality-100/the-296-gtb-will-be-fitted-with-a-6-cylinder-v6-mid-rear-turbo-engine-the-first-on-a-road-car-with-a-ferrari-badge.jpg"}]}

In a major push for PM Narendra Modi’s Make-in-India initiative, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has finally invited Indian companies to build five Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLVs).Confirming this on Friday, Isro chairman K Sivan told TOI: “At this moment we have called for an EOI (expression of interest), and it is not open for any foreign firm. Isro has been considering this for a while, and we think this will boost the Make-in-India initiative of the government.”This marks a major shift in the way Isro, now in its 50th year, has been working over the decades. According to a senior official from the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) the cost of one fully integrated PSLV launch vehicle is Rs 200 crore. This means that the value of the deal Isro is offering private industry—to build five PSLVs—is at least Rs 1,000 crore.However, Sivan did not wish to comment on the cost. The space agency’s new commercial arm—New Space India Limited (NSLI)—has been made responsible for handling the process of technology transfer to the industry. <IMG Economictime_PL_1891_News_1> Having begun functioning under six months ago, on March 6, 2019, NSLI was established to, among other things, achieve the productionisation of PSLV through Indian industry.Elaborating on whether Indian industry is ready to take up such projects, Sivan said: “We think they are. There are some big companies like HAL and L&T that already work with us on PSLV. We are confident that they will, together as a consortium, be able to participate in this process and deliver results.”In fact, NSLI has mandated that only a consortium can participate in the EoI, and is expecting submissions by September 6. In January, Sivan had said that HAL and L&T have already signed an agreement and that the production will soon begin. “There will also be other companies like Godrej and many more smaller companies,” Sivan said on Friday.Any PSLV launch sees more than 150 industries, big and small, contribute to the vehicle. Some of the key contributors have been HAL and L&T.HAL, which has been Isro’s partner in multiple segments—whether it is making the PSLV and GSLV structures or contributing to the CE-20 cryogenic engine—has been hoping to lead the consortium to build PSLV since last year. In fact, as on date, HAL has orders for 24 sets of PSLV structures and two sets of GSLV.L&T too has had a long association with Isro that dates back to 1975, and has been part of building PSLV over the years. In fact, the S139 solid rocket boosters that the PSLV has uses motor casings made by L&T. The company has also been vocal about its business with Isro increasing.Col HS Shankar, CMD, Alpha Design, which has been making satellites for Isro, said: “This is a welcome move. It is the right time for Isro to have opened up the market for private players, and we are confident that the industry will deliver.” While he confirmed that Alpha is aggressively looking at participating in the process, he did not comment on whether it will be along with HAL and L&T or as a separate consortium.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/its-official-in-a-1st-isro-invites-private-firms-to-build-5-pslvs/articleshow/70709796.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1891_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1891_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70708793,width-300,imgsize-110100,,resizemode-4,quality-100/pslv-rep.jpg"}, {"caption": "ISRO-PSLV graphic", "id": "Economictime_PL_1891_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70708800,quality-100/isro-pslv-graphic.jpg"}]}

{"title": "New-age entrepreneurs back govt’s EV plan; old peers oppose it", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1910_News_0>NEW DELHI: The government’s proposal to electrify all new two-wheelers below 150cc in the next six years have split the industry, with new-age entrepreneurs backing the move and their older peers opposing it.Founders of electric two-wheeler startups from Rahul Sharma (Revolt Intellicorp) and Tarun Mehta (Ather Energy) to Jeetender Sharma (Okinawa Electric) said with a slew of new products coming into the market, consumer interest is peaking and this would help trigger the switch-over to emobility in the next three to five years.Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma — who is venturing into the electric mobility space with Revolt IntelliCorp — said the government’s proposal for mass electrification of two-wheelers can be realised in the next three years. He said unavailability of appropriate products in the space had kept consumers from buying electric two-wheelers.“If you give them (users) a great looking product and then tell them that there are no daily expenses on fuel, why will the market not shift? Till now electric products didn’t give such performance. Consumers were looking for something which wasn’t available in the market. That is why I am saying the market will shift in three years,” Sharma told ET. As many as 21 million two-wheelers were sold in the local market in the last financial year.Revolt IntelliCorp will begin sales of AI-enabled motorcycle RV 400 by the end of next month. The product delivers a range of 156 km on a single charge. Sharma said that while the vehicle will be priced similar to petrol-powered two-wheelers and will come equipped with premium connected features, the running costs will be ten times cheaper. Revolt will set up swappable battery stations every 3-5 km, deliver batteries at door step to address consumer concerns over range anxiety.Tarun Mehta, co-founder, Ather Energy, concurred, “This (mass electrification of two-wheelers) will not take a decade. It can happen in the next 2-3 years. We are delivering only in Bengaluru at present, and we have a waiting period of 4-5 months. Supply is limited but consumer interest is peaking. This is the right time for the government to mandate mass electrification…Large manufacturers have the scale to meet this demand.” <IMG Economictime_PL_1910_News_1> Mehta, who believes demand for electric vehicles “will go through the roof ” in future, said automakers’ concerns over lack of availability of charging infrastructure and a competitive vendor base for locally manufacturing electric two-wheelers are outdated. “It does not take a lot of investment to set up charging infrastructure for two-wheelers. As far as local manufacturing is concerned, there are a lot of vendors today who are hungry to get into the e-mobility space. And if there is demand of such scale, component makers will respond,” he said.“We are in 2019 and the government is talking of 2025. Six years is a reasonable time frame for manufacturers who have the will to launch electric products.

{"title": "Patanjali sales growth slows as rivals launch herbal products", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1923_News_0>Patanjali Ayurved’s growth faltered during the past 12 months as rivals, mostly multinationals, launched natural and herbal products to counter the challenge of the Baba Ramdev-led enterprise.Patanjali’s sales volumes grew 7% during October-March 2018 and 22% in April-September 2017, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel, a global consumer research firm. That’s a sharp fall from 52% growth in October-March 2017 and 49% during April-September 2016. Last week, Credit Suisse said Patanjali’s FY18 sales growth by value was little changed after a 100% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past four years. The Swiss financial services company didn’t disclose Patanjali’s actual sales or growth numbers. The company said it has been able to make its presence felt in the market and become a household name in a few years, apart from popularising herbal products, and is preparing for the next stage of growth.“Patanjali has been the biggest disruptor in FMCG space. As the brand is established and consistently growing, in terms of both shares and retail shelves, our growth is realistic and in sync with other FMCG companies,” said SK Tijarawala, spokesperson at the Haridwar-based company. “Patanjali built its consumer-facing ayurveda business almost from scratch in a few years and gained market share and shelf space rapidly, challenging established multinational brands in all categories it has forayed in.”For a company that started as a small pharmacy in 1997, Patanjali has launched more than two dozen mainstream FMCG products — from toothpastes, shampoos and other personal care products to modern convenience foods such as cornflakes and instant noodles. Annual sales have doubled every year since 2013 to touch Rs 10,500 crore. Patanjali’s success acted as a catalyst for herbal, ayurvedic and natural products, which now account for about 10% of the consumer goods market. Between FY13 and FY18, these products grew at a CAGR of 21% compared with 11% for the overall FMCG sector.  <IMG Economictime_PL_1923_News_1> Experts said Patanjali’s growth was driven by the novelty factor, with devotees of Baba Ramdev as early adopters of its products and rapid entry into multiple categories with value pricing and differentiated positioning. However, over the past year, toothpaste and honey were the only two categories in which it expanded market share, while its share in soaps and edible oil remained the same. Patanjali’s share in hair oil, shampoo and butter has fallen, according to a recent Ambit Capital report citing Euromonitor data.“With new launches largely done and devotee base penetrated, growth depends on taking market shares from existing players,” analysts Anuj Bansal, Ariha Doshi and Archit Varshney of Ambit Capital wrote in a note. “FY18 witnessed no growth as new launches failed to take off, channel suffered from capital constraints from unsold inventory and GST-led disruptions and competition reacted to claw back market share.” According to Kantar, Patanjali products are present in 37% of households now, compared with 31% a year ago and 16% about two years ago, reflecting a slower pace of expanding its reach. Patanjali said it isn’t sitting pretty. “We are strengthening our management structure and supply chain to address global expansion. This will result in another phase of our growth driver status in the FMCG marketplace, both in value and volume terms,” Tijarawala said. However, this time around, it will have to compete with more players, other than Dabur, Emami and Himalaya, which have been in the ayurveda space for decades. Leading MNCs, too, have herbal products now – Hindustan Unilever relaunched the Ayush brand of ayurvedic personal care products and L’Oreal introduced a hair-care range under the Garnier Ultra Blends made with natural ingredients.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/patanjali-sales-growth-slows-as-rivals-launch-herbal-products/articleshow/65432839.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1923_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1923_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-65432836,width-300,imgsize-284445,,resizemode-4,quality-100/patanjali.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-3", "id": "Economictime_PL_1923_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65432840,quality-100/untitled-3.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Twenty years of private insurance: How the industry has shaped up", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1951_News_0>About a quarter of a century ago when a budding finance executive at Colgate Palmolive wanted to salt away some savings for the future, she decided to catch the Life Insurance Corp of India agent when he makes his next appearance in the office with the ubiquitous black briefcase. She waited for weeks.Come 2020, she is selling lakhs of insurance policies at the tap of an app on mobile phones and all it takes is a few minutes to mail the policy document instead of weeks of wait for the policy to arrive by the unpredictable India Post to shove it to safety in the steel cupboard.The evolution of Indian insurance industry since competition was introduced as part of gradual liberalization of the economy is akin to the automobile industry where customers began to have a choice of products that suited the needs and tastes. <IMG Economictime_PL_1951_News_1>Unlike other industries, insurance being a sensitive and vital portion of an individual’s future planning, had to be strictly regulated. While the industry had its share of bumps along the way, the two-decade journey has been sweet for many, but a struggle for a few others.Aggregate sum assured of Indian lives is up from Rs 7.34 lakh crores in 2001, to Rs 173 lakh crore in 2020. The number of products on the shelves is up to more than 250, from just one two decades ago. In general insurance, the size of the industry is at Rs 1.69 lakh crore, up from Rs 10,087 crore in gross direct premium when the state monopoly was dismantled.``The most important aspect which came to the fore with the entry of private insurers in the arena was the focus on products different from the traditional ones sold by LIC of India in the past,’’ says M.R. Kumar, chairman, Life Insurance Corp of India, which has two-third market share by premium despite stiff competition.Industry GrowthIndia’s life insurance industry now comprises 24 companies from just one state-run monopoly at the turn of the century. Today, more than 500 million Indians are covered under various health and life policies from around 100 million Indians when LIC was the sole insurer. From one participating product, where the policy holder also got the share of profits, those seeking protection today have an option to choose from more than 250 offerings.As the state dominated all walks of business prior to 1991 liberalisation with socialistic policies that made tax rates steep, insurance in India was more a tax saving instrument. It also fulfilled the need for saving for the future through its safety net aspect. But the industry and customers have since evolved.``In its first leg of growth, the sales pitch for life insurance was linked to tax-based incentives under section 80C of income tax act,’’ says N.S. Kannan, CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. ``The focus then shifted to a goal-based savings agenda. We had a famous advertisement around a character called ‘Chintamani’ that captured the anxiety over financial security among most middle-class Indian adults. Now ‘protection’ is dominating the discourse where people are talking about term products with critical illness riders.’’Two decades after the doors were first flung open for private capital to begin insurance business, companies are beginning to make protection – the primary goal of insurance - their prime source of business instead of competing for the savers’ wallet to boost their assets size.``Against the three traditional savings products that were available in 2000, there are 250 products the industry sells,’’ says Vibhah Padalkar, CEO of HDFC Life. She started her professional career at toothpaste maker Colgate Palmolive. ``It’s like visiting a supermarket in the US.’’Traditional savings products account for about 60% of the total now, compared with 100% a decade ago. Pure term insurance policies that provide just protection account for about 6% of the industry in sum assured. As insurers learn their lessons and prepare for a long haul, the share of the Unit Linked Insurance Policies that dented its reputation is slowly waning.The JourneyPermitting private capital was an extension of the liberalisation reforms that began in 1991 so that long term capital could be funnelled into industry. While most political parties were in favour of it, the bill when it was introduced in 1996 had to be withdrawn at the last minute when the Gujral government turned shaky.Subsequently it was revived and the Vajpayee government passed with rules that ringfenced the industry from potential wrongdoings.``There were two big fears about letting foreigners – one was whether the premium money would be siphoned off and what if the foreigners dominate the Indian market,’’ says N. Rangachary, the founding chairman of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.Rangachary who announced his intentions at the Indian Merchants Chamber in Mumbai to open a small window for licenses, changed his mind in minutes to go for on tap license when he heard murmurs in the crowd about a design to apply and block licenses and trade them at a later date.When IRDAI was keen on having financial institutions like banks do insurance, the then Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan had reservations about it on mounting risks. It was allowed only after Rangachary promised structures that would ring fence them. <IMG Economictime_PL_1951_News_2> <IMG Economictime_PL_1951_News_3>Regulatory BattleThe financial services industry - banking, insurance, or stock markets - have seen a gradual entry of international companies and increased transparency from an opaque cartelized structure. In this transformation, regulators have played a vital role and often have clashed among themselves to protect investors and savers.One such milestone in the history of Indian finance would be the battle between the Securities & Exchange Board of India chairman C.B. Bhave and the chairman of the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India, J. Hari Narayan over the turf to control Unit Linked Insurance Products, or ULIPs.In 2010, Bhave’s SEBI questioned the legitimacy of the insurers in selling the ULIPs which had the characteristics of a mutual fund scheme. Narayan’s IRDAI wouldn’t be trespassed by the securities regulator. As the fight raged, it settled in favour of IRDAI. But the unintended fallout was that savers benefited from lower costs of distribution and insurers themselves moved from short termism to a sustainable business model.“In the first 15-16 years, the root cause of all problems was that we were not focused on consumers,’’ says Naveen Tahilyani, CEO, Tata AIA Life Insurance. ``The regulator did what it needed to do. That intervention has continued because the lens through which the regulator gauges the growth, quality and development is from that of a consumer.”Insurers in their quest to grow were handing out commissions as high as Rs 6,462 crore which was 7.6% to total premium for sale of ULIPs and other products and that has since fallen to 5.47 % in FY20. The share of ULIP in premiums accrued fell from 43% in FY10 to 18% in FY20.At the same time when it came to general insurance, the price control methods stifled the growth and led to losses. But the regulator decided to free up the pricing that led to better underwriting and a collapse in policy premium, especially in automobile insurance.The regulatory interventions also changed the way companies looked to grow their businesses. From a commission-based agent model, to bancassurance, and then to digital platforms has been the journey to grow the business.``Over the last 5-6 years, the change has not just been brought about through regulatory impetus, but through a realization among companies that in order to thrive they needed to build lifelong relationships with households,” says Sandeep Ghosh, Partner & Leader - Financial Services Consulting at EY.As the younger generation distinguishes between saving and protection and the behavioral changes induced by the Covid-19 pandemic make their impact, insurance is set to get transformed with a higher share of protection and health insurance.``Customer preferences and lifestyles will perhaps be the key elements for the direction of the industry towards differentiated products, services and overall business and risk management practices,’’ says LIC’s Kumar.The state is giving a big push to the welfare of people and insurance – health, farm, life - is at the heart of it. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, and Atal Pension Yojana are among them. In September 2018, the government launched the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a comprehensive indemnity health insurance scheme with a sum insured of INR 500,000 targeting 10.7 crore families.As the industry steps into the third decade of private insurers, what’s worrying is some industry practices.``We de-tariffed premium to let market forces to play but what is worrying is that some general insurers are offering massive discounts in some cases as much as 90 per cent and that’s not good,’’ says Rangachary, former IRDAI Chairman. ``The regulator itself has to get a bit proactive to develop the market.''With insurers such as ICICI Pru Life, HDFC Life, ICICI Lombard and GIC Re getting listed, investor interest is gathering momentum as well. But what do all these mean for those who are looking for a safer future? Individuals would be able to design their policies with various permutations and combinations.``It will be a movement towards pizza toppings from the fixed hostel menu,’’ says Padalkar of HDFC Life.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/twenty-years-of-private-insurance-how-the-industry-has-shaped-up/articleshow/79994639.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1951_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "With insurers such as ICICI Pru Life, HDFC Life, ICICI Lombard and GIC Re getting listed, investor interest is gathering momentum as well.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1951_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-79994685,width-300,imgsize-177839,,resizemode-4,quality-100/insurance.jpg"}, {"caption": "in", "id": "Economictime_PL_1951_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-80002098,quality-100/in.jpg"}, {"caption": "table 1", "id": "Economictime_PL_1951_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79994763,quality-100/table-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "table 222", "id": "Economictime_PL_1951_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79994800,quality-100/table-222.jpg"}]}

Prime Minister Modi also urged the European leaders to support India and South Africa’s proposal at the World Trade Organization for waiver of patents to expedite production of Covid-19 vaccines. India and the EU decided to restart talks about a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade agreement, Vikas Swarup, secretary (West), ministry of external affairs, told media persons. He said the decision to resume FTA talks was the biggest achievement from the summit. FTA talks, which began in 2007, have been deadlocked since 2013 over issues including tariffs, market access and data security status. “India’s interests lie in greater market access in Europe for our goods and services, skilled manpower,” commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said after the summit. “Countries are looking for trusted trading partners and our track record, I hope, gives confidence to our European friends that India will be your most natural and reliable ally, partner and friends.” <IMG Economictime_PL_1954_News_1>Safe, Affordable Access to Covid-19 Vaccines“With the cost of production high in Europe but competitive and reasonable in India, it gives European business great opportunity to produce in India. We can create a win-win partnership,” Goyal said. At the summit, India and the EU decided to support universal, safe, equitable and affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments, and the strengthening of health systems, while acknowledging the key role of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) in this regard.All EU leaders at the summit individually thanked India for the medical supplies last year when they were battling a surge in Covid-19 cases. They expressed solidarity with Indian citizens and committed to provide whatever support they can to help India overcome the deadly second wave of the pandemic. The PM appreciated the EU’s and its individual member states’ quick support and assistance to fight the pandemic.The two sides agreed to cooperate on resilient medical supply chains, vaccines and active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as the application of international good manufacturing standards to ensure high quality and safety of products. While Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, the host of the summit, proudly referred to his status as an Overseas Citizen of India, the Belgian PM, Alexander De Croo, greeted his Indian counterpart in Gujarati, saying “Kem Chho”. French President, Emmanuel Macron, said India does not need to listen to lectures from anyone about vaccine supplies. “India has exported a lot for humanity to many countries. We know what situation India is in,” he said. Spanish PM, Pedro Sanchez, on his part, warmly recalled India’s assistance last year when his country was going through its worst phase of the pandemic.In order to give a fresh push to the FTA talks, India and the EU agreed that it is imperative to find solutions to long-standing market access issues. They also decided to start negotiations on a separate agreement on geographical indications, which could be concluded separately or integrated into the trade agreement, depending on the pace of negotiations. The two sides decided to create a joint working group to intensify regulatory cooperation on goods and services, including but not limited to the green and digital technologies. “We also agreed to set up a joint working group on resilient supply chains, building inter alia on the experience we have gained from the Covid-19 pandemic,” said a joint statement. The bilateral high-level dialogue on trade and investment has been tasked with ensuring progress on market access issues and supervising negotiations, as well as keeping progress on cooperation on regulatory aspects and resilient value chains under review. India and the EU agreed on early operationalisation of the Joint Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, besides enhancing partnership in relation to 5G technology and beyond 5G. They also decided to deepen technological cooperation on quantum and high-performance computing.In addition, the two sides sought early conclusion of the working arrangement between Europol and India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, which will support coordination and synergies in preventing and fighting terrorism and organised crime. They decided to enhance dialogue in the area of security and defence, including through joint initiatives and exploring negotiations for a framework partnership agreement.There was significant focus at the summit on the Indo-Pacific partnership as well, as the two sides emphasised commitment to a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific region, underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, democracy and rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce, and peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea.

Companies undertake measures to decouple growth from their environmental footprint and focus on eco-friendly operations, manufacturing facilities and activities, with the objective of minimising the impact of operations on and nurturing the biodiversity. Usually, retail investors, distributors of financial products or financial advisers focus on returns. But now, society wants to associate with businesses that are more responsible towards sustainability. This is already visible in the global lending and investing practices. Companies, despite generating high profits, could lose prominence or importance in the investment horizon if they have low ESG scores and thereby risk losing capital flows.Havells India and Godrej Consumer Products are among the 12 Indian companies that are going to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) 2019, used for assessing environmental, social and governance (ESG) performances.Havells eliminated the use of trace Kr-85 radioactive isotope from the entire CMI (ceramic metal halide) lighting range a few years back.

{"title": "Defence Ministry’s startup initiative takes wing; drones, ammo project identified", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1986_News_0>NEW DELHI: A defence ministry initiative to encourage startups to bring in innovative solutions for military problems has taken wing, with critical projects identified this year for development and induction into the forces, including a swarm drone system and smart loitering munitions.Both projects, identified after a challenge in which startups and technology companies across the country participated, are critical given the current challenge on the eastern border and the proliferation of smart, precise attack weapons that have shaped modern warfare.While the IDeX (Innovations for Defence Excellence) challenge was initiated in 2018, this year steps a significant mark up with cutting edge attack technology identified for development by the private sector—something that had been under the purview of state-owned defence organisations in the past. Officials say the response from the Indian startup ecosystem has been encouraging, particularly when it comes to futuristic weapon systems. <IMG Economictime_PL_1986_News_1>“IDeX has shown that our startups can take up the challenge of cutting edge technologies in large number of cases for defence and aerospace and deliver them. The startups are particularly strong in digital technologies and as we move towards weapons and equipment becoming smart and unmanned, the importance will continue to grow,” defence secretary Ajay Kumar said. Of the nine projects chosen this year, ET has learnt that one pertains to the air launched smart drone system being designed by HAL to beat enemy air defences, like the ones deployed by China in Tibet after the Ladakh crisis broke out. This is to be developed by the Bengaluru-based NewSpace Research & Technologies.Two other critical projects pertain to the development of smart loitering munitions that will be developed for the air force and navy by Telangana-based Avision Systems. Loitering munitions have proven to be critical in recent conflicts with their ability to carry out precise attacks behind enemy lines. Officials say that an innovative approach by the industry has been key to the success of the programme. <IMG Economictime_PL_1986_News_2>“Technology plays a huge role in modern warfare and innovation is the key. IDEX is a platform to rope in young minds, MSMEs, startups and incubators to create innovative technology-driven solutions,” defence production secretary Raj Kumar said. A key differential from the past has been the participation of new, dynamic startups that are not bound by rules that sometimes bind state-owned enterprises from focusing on futuristic technology given commitments to strategic programmes like missiles, aircraft and large land-based systems.There is an understanding in the system that the growing startup ecosystem can be used to fill critical gaps. “It is a bridge that we are creating between the startup eco- system and the defence establishment. There are certain things that can be done better by startups and MSMEs than the conventional system,” said Sanjay Jaju, additional secretary, Department of Defence Production.Officials said that some startup products that had been identified in the initial stages have been able to complete development and have reached the procurement stage in less than 18 months. “I expect that the procurement of these should start. Besides, also expect many more problems offered to startups in coming years. We have targeted 200 problems in next five years and I see every possibility that this target be exceeded,” defence secretary Kumar said.While there have been attempts in the past, including roping in of premier educational institutes for product development, there had been limited success as timelines were not met and there was no guarantee of procurement.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/defence-ministrys-startup-initiative-takes-wing-drones-ammo-project-identified/articleshow/79668036.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1986_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "PM inspecting IDEX programmes at Defence Expo 2020.", "id": "Economictime_PL_1986_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-79668247,width-300,imgsize-514373,,resizemode-4,quality-100/modi-idex.jpg"}, {"caption": "4", "id": "Economictime_PL_1986_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79668292,quality-100/4.jpg"}, {"caption": "3", "id": "Economictime_PL_1986_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79668377,quality-100/3.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Kirana revival a key pivot in distribution chain of FMCG, say industry executives", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_1984_News_0>BENGALURU: The dramatic bounceback of grocery stores or kirana has been one of the most important pivots in the omnichannel distribution chain of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies this year, top industry executives representing the sector at the CII FMCG Summit on Thursday, said. Apart from investment in ecommerce due to surge in online shopping amid the pandemic, FMCG companies are aggressively extending support and chasing the modernisation of traditional kirana ecosystem.“Never in the history of FMCG trade in India has seen so much capital, technology and talent directed at modernising of the kiranas. When you modernise the syntax of shopping, sales and consumption go up,” said Damodar Mall, CEO-grocery retail, Reliance Retail.The country’s largest retailer is banking on both ecommerce and kiranas to drive consumption for their grocery division which includes Reliance Fresh and online grocery delivery platform JioMart. <IMG Economictime_PL_1984_News_1>“In the first wave of ecommerce, recruitment happened in value fashion and electronics. Now, grocery will lead the way. However, the most balanced omnichannel player has always been kirana. Half of their business was being done with remote order and home delivery, which has been now replaced by apps and Whatsapp messages. It is we who have conveniently learnt to keep the silos of traditional and ecommerce models,” said Mall.Executives said that they are learning from new and challenger brands such as Yoga Bar and Epigamia or partnering tech startups to drive change and efficiency in distribution to aid the new architecture of the kirana space.Personal care conglomerate Godrej Consumer Products Limited (GCPL) has launched pilots with technological support to embrace kiranas.“Getting kiranas to service faster is key as it increases turnover rates for everybody. Geo-tagging and geo-fencing technologies are coming handy as they track real time interface of the retailer and productivity. Chat bot-based ordering and tele-calling aid remote ordering,” said Sunil Kataria, CEO-India SAARC of GCPL.The maker of brands Good Knight, Hit and Cinthol said it was currently working on segmentation of kiranas based on profile, strength and catchments by providing customised trade marketing support to maximise revenue.According to an EY survey in July, about 79% of kirana owners in non-metros and 50% in metros said new consumers started visiting their stores after lockdown. These were consumers who had earlier shopped online or from supermarkets but now preferred to buy from local kiranas.Jumbotail, an online wholesale marketplace for food and grocery products for kiranas and supermarkets, said about 80% of average ticket size in grocery is less than Rs 200, which creates challenges.“India is a small ticket high frequency purchase market. While modern trade and ecommerce will continue to grow, we believe that for such small ticket sizes, one would not want to walk into a large format store. Therefore, large scale digitisation of mom-and-pop stores will be the fastest and the most viable option to organise in this market,” said Jumbotail’s cofounder Ashish Jhina.Executives said FMCG companies are now keen on tapping the untouched rural kiranas in the next phase of the new normal, which they believe will be bigger than the urban ecosystem.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/kirana-revival-a-key-pivot-in-distribution-chain-of-fmcg-say-idustry-executives/articleshow/79672443.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_1984_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_1984_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-79672464,width-300,imgsize-1066675,,resizemode-4,quality-100/4.jpg"}, {"caption": "3", "id": "Economictime_PL_1984_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79672468,quality-100/3.jpg"}]}

The chairman felt it was important to review the rights such PE investors get from their shareholdings and whether this can translate into an ability to influence the decision of a firm, consequently impacting competition. “This study would help us in identifying the kind of shareholding rights available to common shareholders, the type of influence these rights provide and the available safeguards in companies' policies for mitigating competition concerns if any,” he said.Pharmaceutical SectorThe announcement comes on the back of the competition watchdog’s recently launched market study of the Indian pharmaceutical sector, focusing on distribution channels within the industry. The pharmaceutical sector plays a pivotal role in the public health agenda of any nation with quality, access and affordability of medicines being key determinants of the quality of its public health, Gupta said. “However, owing to inherent information asymmetry between consumers and suppliers of medicines, markets by themselves, may not deliver optimal outcomes in terms of these parameters,” he added.To this end, the CCI launched a market study in October to understand discounts and margins policies at wholesale and retail levels of the distribution system, the role of trade associations vis-a-vis various aspects of the distribution business relating to regulation of trade margins and its impact on price and competition along with the impact of e-commerce in this segment. “Besides, the study also aims to investigate the extent of proliferation of branded generic drugs in India with its implications for competition and to assess potential hurdles, if any, in entry of bio-equivalents or biosimilar drugs in India,” Gupta said.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/cci-trains-its-focus-on-pe-investments-across-sectors-in-india/articleshow/79562517.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2003_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "“However, owing to inherent information asymmetry between consumers and suppliers of medicines, markets by themselves, may not deliver optimal outcomes in terms of these parameters,” he added.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2003_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-79562563,width-300,imgsize-56378,,resizemode-4,quality-100/pe.jpg"}, {"caption": "5 dec", "id": "Economictime_PL_2003_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79576219,quality-100/5-dec.jpg"}]}

With lower barriers to internet access, users across the world have benefited, but bad actors have also gained entry. With the increasing user adoption and the contribution of digital connectivity in India’s economy, we cannot take the internet for granted. Since the pandemic broke, there is a heightened need to strengthen safety and security, reliability and privacy, and the overall resilience of the internet and its applications. In addition to helping users build better digital skills, we need to develop tools to aid them in their quest for safety, so that companies, individuals, researchers, and governments can harness the internet for good, whilst protecting themselves from harm,” Cerf said.This was followed by a virtual chat between Debjani Ghosh, President, NASSCOM, and Kristie Canegallo, Vice President, Trust and Safety, Google, on the role of industry towards ensuring a safer Internet.Ghosh said that the transformation of the Internet in India is unmatched with any other place, with 600 million users at the grassroot level already connected to the Internet.\"For a lot of these users, digital literacy is preceding literacy,\" Ghosh added.Emphasising on the \"need to continue to innovate to build for the grassroot level\", she added that while these are tremendous advantages and benefits of the Internet, one of the biggest challenges is how to keep users safe. <IMG Economictime_PL_2058_News_1>Ghosh said it was important to make the Internet so intuitive that it shouldn't matter whether one can read, write or speak in English, whether they can read and write at all.

The Pixel 4 sports a 5.7 inch display (4 XL has a 6.3 inch display) and both have a 90Hz refresh rate. They run Snapdragon 855, have 6GB RAM and a dual rear-camera setup (12MP standard and 16MP telephoto).For clearer selfies, the phones have a 8MP front shooter. There is a 2,800mAh battery in Pixel 4 and a 3,700mAh battery in the 4 XL.The Night Sight feature also gets an update making it now possible to take pictures of the night sky. <IMG Economictime_PL_2083_News_1> The new phones now comes with better facial recognition for unlocking the phone with a glance. Unlike the existing 'trusted face' feature on Android phones, the new Face Unlock is intended to be more secure and easier to use.Google has also brought motion-sensing technology, that will allow users to skip songs or switch apps with gestures, to the phones.There is also a new recorder app that can transcribe in real-time.The Pixel 4 is priced at $799, while the larger XL version will cost $899. Pre-bookings in the US open today, and the phones will go on sale from October 24. The smartphone won't be available in India, Google confirmed in a statement. While the company did not give a reason, it said it looks forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\"Google has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends, and product features. We decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India. We remain committed to our current Pixel phones and look forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India,\" read the statement.The Pixel 4 comes in three colours variants: Just Black, Clearly White, and a limited-edition Oh So Orange. The tech giant also announced its new Pixel Buds, touted as Google's answer to Apple's AirPods. The new Buds offer five hours of continuous listening time on a single charge, and 24 hours of battery life when using the case. They will go on sale early next year at $179. <IMG Economictime_PL_2083_News_2> The light-weight Pixelbook Go also made its debut at the event. The 13.3 inch touchscreen laptop weighs two pounds and is 13 mm thin. It comes with backlit, 'Hush' keys, and up to 12 hours of battery life. Google says the laptop will give users two hours of battery on just 20 minutes of charging. The new laptop follows the Pixelbook, which debuted in 2017 at $999.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2083_News_3> The laptop's rippled design at the bottom makes it easy to grip. Priced at $649, it is currently available only in black, with the pink variant coming soon.The Nest Mini, an upgrade to the Google Home Mini (launched in 2017), was also unveiled. For its smart speaker, Google has taken the sustainability route, and is using recycled plastic bottles to make the Nest Mini.The Nest Mini comes with a wall mount, and will now be available in a new colour option, Sky Blue.Other announcements included the Nest Wifi, and details about its cloud-generation gaming platform, Stadia.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/google-pixel-4-launched-at-799-wont-come-to-india/articleshow/71602254.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2083_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Tech enthusiasts, rejoice!

The share price moved down by -0.26 per cent from its previous close of Rs 370.00. The last traded stock price is Rs 369.05.Tata Consumer came out with campaigns targeting each state separately in FY20. It changed the product packaging as well as method of communication to connect with regional consumers. Key states targeted under this strategy were UP, Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. It also acquired regional brands (Kala Ghoda and Lal Ghoda) in Rajasthan. According to the brokerage, Tata Consumer reported strong revenue growth of 32.9 per cent in FY20, largely driven by acquisition of the consumer products portfolio of Tata Chemicals. India beverages reported revenue growth of 6.6 per cent. International beverages reported revenue decline of 0.4 per cent. Revenues of non-branded business were up 15.7 per cent. Tata Starbucks reported revenue growth of 21 per cent. The brokerage likes Tata Consumer’s strategy to (a) focus on regional launches to gain market shares as consumer preferences change in different states, (b) leverage Tata Sampann brand to launch food products such as nutrimixes/ chilla mix, poha, and pulses based snacks, (c) invest in digital transformation from sourcing to distribution, (d) keep closer connect with consumers as the habits/ buying pattern are likely to change and (e) enable direct delivery of products through delivery providers and e-commerce partners. The brokerage says it remains a believer and retains an add rating with an SoTP based target price of Rs 415. Sustained improvement in return ratios (EVA positive) is integral for long-term value creation. At this valuation, the stock will trade at a P/E of Rs 45 times on FY22E EPS. <IMG Economictime_PL_2096_News_1>The brokerage models the company to report revenue and PAT CAGR of 6.3 per cent and 11.4 per cent, respectively over FY20-22E.

The company reported net profit after tax of Rs -50.21 crore in the latest quarter.Promoters held 34.69 per cent stake in the company as of March 31, 2020, while FIIs held 17.08 per cent, DIIs 21.82 per cent and public and other 26.42 per cent.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/add-tata-consumer-products-target-price-rs-415-icici-securities/articleshow/76416415.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2096_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_2096_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76416412,width-210,imgsize-190511,,resizemode-4,quality-100/add.jpg"}, {"caption": "Tata Consumer-I-Sec-June172020", "id": "Economictime_PL_2096_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-76416432,quality-100/tata-consumer-i-sec-june172020.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Premium focus holds margins for Bajaj Auto", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2102_News_0>ET Intelligence Group: Will analysts upgrade Bajaj Auto? Or, will the lack of visibility on three-wheeler sales continue to weigh on the company that leads in short-haul, inner-city public transport?After the September quarter earnings, the odds appear to be shortening in favour of the first outcome. Margins are improving and Bajaj Auto’s product mix is becoming decidedly richer, and market share locally is climbing as well.Margins rose 110 basis points to 17.7%, while volumes shrank 10%. Margin expansion could narrow the stock’s underperformance relative to peers. In the last three months, Bajaj Auto gained 0.8%, while its peers rose 8-12%.Record sales volumes of premium bikes, such as the range-topping Pulsar, KTM and Husqvarna improved average realization by 3.5% YoY to Rs 67,935 per unit. An encouraging response to the recently launched Pulsar 125 cc bike has supported local motorcycle volumes.<IMG Economictime_PL_2102_News_1>The introduction of the Pulsar 125cc helped Bajaj acquire 16% market share in the 125cc category and expanded the segment to a quarter of the total motorcycle segment.Domestic motorcycle volume grew 6% to 5.5 lakh units in the quarter. Thanks to the richer product mix in the domestic market, margins locally were at a 16-quarter high. In the last six months, the average monthly domestic volume has been 1.26 lakh units. The street factored in domestic motorcycles to decline 12-15% in FY21, followed by a rebound of 20-22% for FY22.In September, the domestic motorcycle volume grew 24% to 2.19 lakh units. To achieve the street’s volume estimates, monthly bikes sales should be higher than 1.7 lakh units. The monthly exit rate of September and the festival season would imply that maintaining a monthly run-rate of 1.7 lakh units may not be difficult for Bajaj.Export volumes have been mixed, with South Asia, the Middle East and Africa reaching nearly 90% of the pre-Covid run-rate; ASEAN countries remain laggards. Exports of two-wheelers rose 16% to 185,351 units in September, but sustaining the record sales might be tough given the political protests in Nigeria.The high-margin three-wheeler business continues to struggle. Volumes locally dropped 78% in the September quarter and 20% in the overseas market. Preference for personal transport and reluctance of financers to tender new loans could crimp growth.The stock is trading at 17.6 times its one-year forward earnings, a 3% premium to the long-term average. The P/E will largely hinge on the sustainability of the monthly run-rate after the festival season and the ability to meet 20-22% volume growth next fiscal.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/premium-focus-holds-margins-for-bajaj-auto/articleshow/78819053.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2102_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The street factored in domestic motorcycles to decline 12-15% in FY21, followed by a rebound of 20-22% for FY22.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2102_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-78820642,width-210,imgsize-551363,,resizemode-4,quality-100/bajaj-auto.jpg"}, {"caption": "Premium Focus Holds Margins for Bajaj Auto", "id": "Economictime_PL_2102_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-78819052,quality-100/premium-focus-holds-margins-for-bajaj-auto.jpg"}]}
{"title": "The rise of self-improvement & productivity apps, hacks", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2123_News_0>Manas Saloi is obsessed with productivity. “I’m always trying to make the most of my time,” says the 28-year-old from Bengaluru over a WhatsApp call, while pacing up and down his room to keep the step count going. A product manager at the tech company Gojek, his work requires him to create a goal-setting framework called OKR or Objectives and Key Results — basically, a list of measurable goals. Saloi has made this a part of his life. He sets personal OKR — an annual goals list — to improve his physical, mental and intellectual health. This year’s OKR ranges from reading 50 books and playing more football to learning Malayalam (his fiancée’s first language) and walking 4,000 steps daily, among others. He lists them on an Excel sheet, assigns them weightage and a timeline. A column is dedicated to tracking their progress through the year. He shares the OKR online to inspire others and to ensure his own accountability.To achieve these goals, Saloi uses a combination of apps, hacks and wearable gadgets. An app, Loop Habit Tracker, reminds him to read, write and take his vitamin supplements; another, Headspace, helps him meditate. A wearable gadget, Mi Smart Band 4, tracks his activities like walking and running, while a digital notepad, InkPad, ensures that his thoughts don’t slip away. He takes stock of his personal growth at the end of every week.If self-improvement were a brand, Saloi would make a feisty ambassador. Except he would have a million contenders. Like Jitesh Luthra, 28, a market development professional at VC firm Blume Ventures, who limits his social media usage on the phone to three hours a day, practises intermittent fasting and sugarless eating as a lifestyle choice and is trying to learn Italian. Or, Anamika Sirohi, a Gurgaon-based marketing professional, who does 45 minutes of cardio exercise at sunrise, takes podcasts on productivity for breakfast and clocks 10,000 steps on her fitness tracker by the end of a day. Sometimes she prefers standing during work meetings to break her sedentary pattern.At a time when our innate desire to be a better version of ourselves finds support in easily accessible apps and hacks, the obsession with self-improvement is not limited to Saloi, Luthra and Sirohi. It is a cultural phenomenon across age groups, professions and geographies. People want to try out the latest fads in health and wellness, and monitor and improve meals, sleep, heart rate and mood swings. And they are willing to pay for it.An ecosystem of blogs, books, videos, podcasts and apps feeds the desire to improve oneself to the point that it feels like the central purpose of life, that failing at it would mean failing at life itself. Productivity influencers are real, and popular ones like Thomas Frank have close to 2 million subscribers on YouTube. Five of the top 10 podcasts on Spotify in India are on lifestyle content based on self-motivation, with On Purpose with Jay Shetty emerging as the most streamed podcast on most days. Even in the time of Netflix and Audible, the written word provides a continuous stream of productivity porn. On Amazon India, books in the category of “Mind, Body & Spirit” grew by 1.2 times in 2019 over 2018, a company spokesperson told ET Magazine. Atomic Habits, a book on enhancing productivity by James Clear, has sold over a million copies worldwide since October 2018. A survey by market research firm Fact.MR pegs the potential size of the global smart fitness tracker market at $2.7 billion by the end of 2022. This includes trackers for sleep, heart rate, activities and meals. <IMG Economictime_PL_2123_News_1>  <IMG Economictime_PL_2123_News_2>  <IMG Economictime_PL_2123_News_3>  <IMG Economictime_PL_2123_News_4>  Competition StreakStreaks, a paid app on iOS for habit tracking, earned $40,000 in net revenue in January 2020 alone, according to Sensor Tower. Created by Australian developer Quentin Zervaas, the app unwittingly competes with and often benefits an Android app by the same name created by an Indian developer for the same genre.Shobhit Bakliwal, 27, a Bengaluru-based developer who created Streaks for Android, says, “Three years ago, I got a legal notice from them to change my app’s name. I pointed out to them that my app released before them in 2015.” His Streaks has over 100,000 users and makes an annual revenue of $15,000-16,000. “Given Android’s larger universe, I benefit from their popularity because people come looking for it on Android and assume it’s the same app,” he says. As he has since moved to other projects, leaving Streaks to almost run on autopilot, Bakliwal doesn’t consider his iOS counterpart a competitor anymore. <IMG Economictime_PL_2123_News_5> For seekers of self-improvement, though, even competition is a productivity hack. Satyarth Priyedarshi, 38, uses the in-built activity tracker in his Apple Watch for competitive fitness tracking with his wife Jyoti. “It’s a healthy competition. When I occasionally drop out, she helps me get back in the game,” says the Mumbai-based digital professional. There are standalone apps like Habitshare, with over 50,000 followers, that allow users to track habits with friends and family for “extra accountability”.An astonishingly high number of users download apps that remind them to drink water. Over 10 million users are on an Android app called Water Drink Reminder. “These apps assess your activity levels and weight to determine when and how much water you should have in a day,” says Ankita Rai, 27, a Mumbai-based student of chartered accountancy, who uses a hydration app. Mubeena Azeez, 32, installed one last year when she found she had kidney stones. “The app helped because I would otherwise forget to drink water while working crazy hours,” says the Bengaluru-based HR professional. Azeez also has a period tracker app that keeps her prepared for any likelihood of inconvenience at work during menstruation.Big PlannersPlanning your day — through apps or creative bullet journals — to be able to do more in less time is par for the course. Oindrila Dey, 21, a master’s student from Kolkata, has a bullet journal to keep track of her meals and her moods. “Two years ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD and my therapist told me to write things down.” Bullet journalling or Bujo has helped Dey keep calm. <IMG Economictime_PL_2123_News_6> At Snapdeal, “planners” was the most searched item in the diaries category last year. While these were in the Rs 400-500 price category, annual planners at higher price points are doing well too. Illustrator Alicia Souza says her annual planners, currently priced at Rs 1,500, have witnessed a 100% year-on-year growth in sales since its launch three years ago. Souza’s customers, mostly women, give her suggestions — to include a meal and grocery planner, and a period tracker — that ultimately find their way into it.Annkur Agarwal, cofounder of Pricebaba, too, prefers pen and paper to make his daily to-do lists. “I think it’s because the digital screen is a distraction in itself. There’s always the risk of slipping into WhatsApp messages while making your list,” says the 33-year-old Mumbaikar.Pursuit of AppinessInside the self-improvement theme park, not riding on an app is still acceptable, but decluttering of emails is de rigueur, especially in some sectors where professionals end up getting 100-odd emails in a day and have to reply to most of them. Superhuman, a Silicon Valley-based SaaS company for better email management, has attained quite the aspirational status in this space. The invite-only service comes for a monthly membership fee of $30. As on February 21, it had over 285,000 users waiting for membership access, says founder and CEO Rahul Vohra. While he declines to share the number of existing members, a June 2019 article in the New York Times pegs it at a little less than 15,000 customers. India is among its top four markets, after the US, UK and Canada, Vohra told ET Magazine. Luthra of Blume Ventures is a fan and has got director Sajith Pai on board too. Pai now hopes to find similar efficiencies in workflow apps like calendar, to-do lists and notes.At Superhuman and in Silicon Valley, a productivity app called Notion is popular for its workflow management capability, which brings notes, docs, tasks, projects and communities all under one cloud. “There’s been a 5x increase in the active usage of Notion in India,” says Akshay Kothari, COO of the company with 35 employees and 1 million users. While the tech sector has been its early adopter, a lot of people from diverse backgrounds use it in interesting ways, adds Kothari on a video call from the US. While a medical student uses it for studying and personal development, another user has made a detailed index of Pokémons.The loudest chatter around productivity comes from Bay Area, says Anmol Maini, 23, an engineer with San Francisco-based startup Fast. “Perhaps because we don’t put as many working hours as China does, we want to maximise the time dedicated to work.” This chatter has ripple effects. It has pushed Suhas Motwani, 25, a business analyst at a global FMCG’s Poland office, into co-creating a productivity app with a developer friend in India. Called Indistractable Launcher, the app — with 100,000 installs in beta stage — reduces a user’s screen time by 30% by designing a minimalist phone launcher. “We are already receiving funds on Patreon from fans who have also reviewed the app on YouTube.”Within the global tech community, productivity is not just an obsession, it’s a lifestyle. Maini tells us how growth and product managers across the world keep an eye out for new productivity tools on Product Hunt, which is like a LinkedIn for tech products. Maini says he must have tried 30 different email management services before settling on Superhuman. Besides efficiency tools, sleep and meditation are huge with this community, says Blume’s Pai.Jagdeep Kapoor, brand consultant, Samsika Marketing, explains the obsession with productivity and self-improvement: “When material needs are taken care of, people want to buy products that give them a sense of wellbeing. Also, everyone is out there to prove themselves but not as much to others as to themselves. We believe that to prove ourselves, we have to improve ourselves. It’s as simple as that.”Tech is at the heart of most productivity tools and self-improvement hacks, even when it is to monitor the usage of said tech. In the case of actor and standup comedian Sumukhi Suresh, social media is work, too. Channelling her former background in sales, Suresh keeps monthly targets for her social media posts and their traction. “I tried using HubSpot, a software, to consolidate all my social media apps, but gave up because it takes time to figure out how these tools work. I don’t have the mental bandwidth for that.” However, she feels she will cave in soon.Having tech fulfils our need to track our personal objectives, to stay motivated and to reassure ourselves that we are on the right path, says Meghna Mukherjee, a Noida-based psychoanalytical psychotherapist. On the flip side, “measuring personal growth can make you anxious when you see how far you are from your goal,” says Pai. “I will be lying if I said I don’t get anxious about missed goals.” Before you get better, you often get worse. Pai highlights the importance of not getting enamoured by shiny tools and of limiting to-do things to five daily.But many are far from that stage of wisdom at this point. “A lot of my clients use apps to quantify themselves on certain parameters and say they are falling short of a standard. Hence they are not doing well and need to figure out how to do better,” says Anshuma Kshetrapal, a Delhi-based creative arts psychotherapist. The right question should be “why they are not doing better” instead of “what can they do now to remedy it”, she says. The one-size-fits-all hacks are a problem, she adds, “Your personal nuance gets subdued to pander to these life hacks.”Like a lot of people around her, Sirohi from Gurgaon tried strict diets to stay fit. Eventually, she had to develop hacks that worked for her because those diets were \"not sustainable when your lifestyle needs you to travel and have work dinners and breakfast meetings\". In the case of Azeez from Bengaluru, the mood predictions of her period tracker started dictating her emotions. \"If the app would say I'm likely to feel bloated on the first day, it would make me conscious and that got frustrating.\" Eventually, Azeez learned how not to let the mood predictions affect her. Even someone like Saloi, who wears his apps on his sleeve, literally, knows that \"apps and hacks don't change our lives unless we are disciplined.\" After trying a cloudful of them last year, Saloi has recently replaced most of their functions with a basic alarm reminder.Author and marketer Harish Bhat, 57, keeps it simpler still. \"I am obsessed with productivity but I don't entangle myself with documenting or measuring my goals via apps and hacks,\" he says. After all, \"It's more important to be happy than to be appy.\"", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/the-rise-of-self-improvement-productivity-apps-hacks/articleshow/74260691.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Representative Image", "id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74260804,width-650,imgsize-97880,,resizemode-4,quality-100/apps-agencies.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74261213,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74261222,quality-100/2.jpg"}, {"caption": "3", "id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74261223,quality-100/3.jpg"}, {"caption": "4", "id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74261227,quality-100/4.jpg"}, {"caption": "4", "id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News_5", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74260900,quality-100/4.jpg"}, {"caption": "3", "id": "Economictime_PL_2123_News_6", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74260858,quality-100/3.jpg"}]}

However, the efficacy data is expected to legitimise its use and allow the company to export the vaccine. Bharat Biotech can manufacture 40 million doses.Although India’s vaccination numbers have crossed 10 million since the drive started on January 16, the country is behind in terms of immunisation per 100 people. At the current rate, it will take over two years for India to vaccinate 30 million frontline and healthcare workers. <IMG Economictime_PL_2166_News_1>Biological E, which has tied up with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and vaccine maker Johnson & Johnson, said it plans to start the phase-3 trial of the candidate licensed from Baylor College next week.“We will reach out to the drug controller to start our phase-3 trial for the vaccine candidate with Bayer, independent of the J&J deal,” CEO Mahima Datla told ET. “We can manufacture 1 billion doses a year.”These companies are also working to tailor their vaccines for new emerging variants of the virus.“We are not sure what form the vaccine will take, whether a booster or a second generation or a combination… but recombinant technology (what Biological E is developing) is pretty quick to deploy,” Datla explained.“We can plug in the variant and make the product in 15 days,” said Ella of Bharat Biotech. “Data from the Indian Council of Medical Research will also help. The company is already gearing up in that direction.”On Wednesday, the subject expert committee under India’s drug regulatory authority is likely to take up Dr Reddy’s application for emergency marketing approval for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine.“The SEC is likely to meet on Wednesday and will take up Dr Reddy’s application,” a government official told ET.Dr Reddy’s had approached the drug regulator on February 19 to get emergency approval for Sputnik V. The Sputnik V vaccine, which is registered in more than 30 countries, has shown efficacy of 94%, according to peer-reviewed data published in the Lancet.The vaccine candidate from US drug maker Novavax, which Serum Institute is developing for the Indian market and other low- and middle-income countries, is expected to hit the market in the first half of 2021, said Nivedita Gupta, deputy director of ICMR, the government body that is helping with the trials.Novavax and Serum Institute have an agreement to make 1 billion doses for low- and middle-income countries.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/more-jabs-on-way-3-candidates-to-file-final-data-launch-ph-3-trials/articleshow/81178240.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2166_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "These companies are also working to tailor their vaccines for new emerging variants of the virus.

Makes India centre of fintech push", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2192_News_0>NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Amazon.com Inc has added insurance and even gold to its menu of financial services in India, to expand its customer base and attract more subscribers to its Prime loyalty programme in a battleground growth market.The push ramps up competition as financial technology (fintech) rivals and their deep-pocketed foreign backers struggle for profitability in a predominantly cash-based economy where about 190 million adults do not have bank accounts.To boost online payments, Amazon launched its Amazon Pay digital wallet in 2016. It has since introduced a credit card, signed up to a state-backed payments network, and processes payments for movie and flight tickets as well as telephone and utility bills.It began offering auto insurance in July and gold investment products in August - both a first for Amazon.Its US fintech efforts have been modest by comparison, stymied in part by merchant reluctance to use services offered by their biggest retail rival.In India, however, where it has over 100 million registered users, Amazon is better placed to use financial services to win subscribers to its annual $13 Prime plan which offers faster shipping and music and video streaming, tech executives said.To that end, the company aspires to make Amazon Pay the country's payment method of choice, said Mahendra Nerurkar, head of Amazon Pay in India, which has signed up 4 million merchants.<IMG Economictime_PL_2192_News_1>\"Apparently Chinese fashion designers are leaving the back pockets off jeans because no one uses them anymore (for wallets),\" Nerurkar told Reuters. \"We would love to make that happen in India.\"India's digital payment market is set to more than double in value to $135 billion by 2023 from 2019, showed a study by professional services firm PwC and Indian lobby group ASSOCHAM.Thin-margin businessA ban on high-value currency notes in late 2016 amplified a digital payment drive in India, with Amazon joined in the sphere by Alphabet Inc's Google, Walmart Inc's PhonePe, and Paytm, backed by SoftBank Group Corp.Later prospective entrants have faced tougher regulatory scrutiny. Facebook Inc's WhatsApp, which boasts over 400 million users in India, has been awaiting approval to offer payment services for over two years as regulators wrestle with new data-localisation rules.Yet for incumbents, profit has been elusive. Paytm, also backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, has booked losses running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. PhonePe has said it hopes to turn profitable by 2022.Indeed, profit margins in the digital payments business are generally thin, so to make money, Amazon may have to rely on services such as lending and insurance, industry watchers said.\"It is likely that the next step for Amazon would be to distribute exchange-traded funds and mutual funds,\" said Niren Shah, India head of Silicon Valley firm Norwest Venture Partners.Others said Amazon's sheer muscle does not necessarily mean it can succeed in a market as huge and complex as India.\"It's not going to be easy to win over the Indian fin-tech market,\" said a person who declined to be identified due to a business relationship with Amazon. \"It's competitive and varied, so it's going to be a slow process.\"", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/amazon-woos-consumers-with-insurance-gold-products-makes-india-centre-of-fintech-push/articleshow/77888402.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2192_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A ban on high-value currency notes in late 2016 amplified a digital payment drive in India, with Amazon joined in the sphere by Alphabet Inc's Google, Walmart Inc's PhonePe, and Paytm, backed by SoftBank Group Corp.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2192_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-77903356,width-650,imgsize-180126,,resizemode-4,quality-100/amazon-reuters.jpg"}, {"caption": "Amazon 2 - AP", "id": "Economictime_PL_2192_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-77903427,quality-100/amazon-2-ap.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Salestrail launches in India: an activity tracking app to support remote sales teams", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2224_News_0>Finland-based tech company, Liid, has launched their new sales activity tracking app ––Salestrail––which is specially designed to help remote teams adapt, as we face the coronavirus crisis.Earlier this year, Liid noticed a massive 300% spike in searches for ‘Call Tracking Software’, most noticeably in the Indian market.“There was a clear demand for solutions that could help companies manage their sales teams remotely. We wanted to help them swiftly adapt to this ‘new normal’, especially when there’s a greater need for transparency, and as VoIP calls are currently not an option for pan-India businesses,” says Maria Sundström, CEO and co-founder of Liid Oy in a statement.The new Salestrail App’s features are therefore centred on three primary elements: ease of use, cost-effective and quick to implement. But what makes this solution stand out is the unique insights it provides.An activity tracker, not a CRMWearables and health activity trackers have become common to enhance an individual’s physical health and performance. Salestrail takes the same working-in-the-background approach from consumer activity trackers, but applies it to the world of sales to help professionals.The app’s dashboard helps sales leaders quickly check and follow the call performance of their team members and for the whole organisation.“By tracking sales activities you can analyse everything from when is the best time to call your clients to how much time you should spend on your biggest customers,” says Sundström.Some unique features that are on the product roadmap are speech-to-text notes, custom workflows (to fit each team's sales process) and reminders to follow-up at optimal time and day for all ongoing cases. These features will turn the mobile app into a virtual sales assistant. <IMG Economictime_PL_2224_News_1>“What’s interesting is that for many of our clients, the Salestrail App has also become a fun tool for healthy competition. Unlike a personal activity tracker that only tracks individual performance, Salestrail also lets team members collaborate, see their rankings compared to other teammates,” adds Sundström.According to Sundström, sales teams using Liid’s solutions have saved thousands of working hours for companies. “The app saves salespeople around 30-60 minutes every day as 100% of their sales activities get auto-logged with no mistake, while the managers can monitor their team in real-time even remotely,” she says. All you need is the mobile appThe product needs no technical implementation ––no phone configuration, no sim-card changes and no changes to the company’s work process flow. All you need to do is download the Salestrail App and/or login to the online dashboard.“The whole idea was to keep it hassle-free, light and affordable. SMEs rarely have a lot of money to spend, nor do they want to deploy too many technical resources to implement another new software,” Sundström.That said, the solutions fit even large companies who usually have customer relationship management (CRM) in use.“Salestrail can easily integrate with an existing CRM to enrich the contact data and give a much more detailed analysis and unique call insights than any ordinary CRM,” adds Sundström.“Our tech aims to make meaningful call analytics hassle-free and affordable for all, no matter if you are a startup with a 10-people team or a multinational with a giant sales army,” adds Sundström.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/salestrail-launches-in-india-an-activity-tracking-app-to-support-remote-sales-teams/articleshow/79620155.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2224_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The product needs no technical implementation ––no phone configuration, no sim-card changes and no changes to the company’s work process flow.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2224_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-79620235,width-300,imgsize-515876,,resizemode-4,quality-100/product-photo_app-screens.jpg"}, {"caption": "Maria Sundström - CEO_Founder", "id": "Economictime_PL_2224_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79620256,quality-100/maria-sundstrom-ceo_founder.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Why GCPL, Marico, Britannia & Emami missed the FMCG rally", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2227_News_0>ET Intelligence Group: The fastmoving consumer goods (FMCG) sector has become a safe haven for investors amid the Covid-19 crisis, but not all companies from the space look promising. Multinationals such as HUL, Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive and GSK Consumer Healthcare have led the rally in the segment in recent months.However, Indian-owned mid-sized companies Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL), Marico, Britannia and Emami have been the sector laggards over the past one year, posting negative returns at a time when the FMCG has been among those favoured by investors.These companies were suffering from underperformance even in the pre-coronavirus quarters, but the lockdown aggravated their problems. A significant part of the portfolio of these companies is discretionary staples, or non-essentials, a category that has witnessed poor demand amid the panic buying related to coronavirus. While most of these companies were quick to launch hygiene products such as hand sanitisers, it is becoming a cluttered market that is challenging to crack given the restricted distribution and marketing. Most of these companies also have businesses overseas that will face the adverse impact of the spread of the pandemic. <IMG Economictime_PL_2227_News_1>GCPL: The company that was underperforming in its household insecticides business got adversely impacted during the lockdown. The seller of home and personal care products expects the March quarter revenue to decline in high teens owing to the slide in sales in both local and overseas markets. Demand was seeing a pickup in the first two months of the quarter, but slumped in March. The recovery in revenue is expected to be gradual over the next few quarters.Marico: The company had hit a slowdown in volume growth even before coronavirus. As per the fourthquarter update shared by Marico, its Saffola portfolio of edible oils grew, but overall its personal care and grooming products did not do well due to restricted demand.The launch of Mediker hand sanitiser, while being one of the fastest launches by the company, is a desperate attempt to grab a share in the suddenly expanded market for hand sanitisers and washes where several companies, even from non-FMCG sectors, have jumped in.Britannia: For Britannia, the lockdown is likely to result in a temporary increase in sales of some products. However, the underperformance of the company on volume growth over the past few quarters is likely to continue. Besides, the company is currently operating at 65% of its installed capacity because of labour shortage and transportation issues. This is likely to have an impact on the performance of the company, whose stock is part of the Nifty-50 index, in the first quarter of the current fiscal.Emami: The demand for the company’s summer portfolio has been hit hard, resulting in a loss of revenue from the seasonal product offerings. This comes after the delayed onset of winter impacted the sale of its winter products in the quarter to December 2019. Besides, the Emami Group is going through a deleveraging exercise that has taken a toll on its companies’ valuations over the past year.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-gcpl-marico-britannia-emami-missed-the-fmcg-rally/articleshow/75264797.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2227_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "These companies were suffering from underperformance even in the pre-Covid-19 quarters, but the lockdown aggravated their problems.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2227_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-75264866,width-210,imgsize-407167,,resizemode-4,quality-100/fmcg.jpg"}, {"caption": "B1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2227_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-75264862,quality-100/b1.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Brands gain on rising appetite for healthy living", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2236_News_0>Bengaluru: The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of healthy living among a wider set of consumers, brands have said. As a result, premium direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands in the health and wellness space have seen a sustained increase in orders, data shared by ecommerce firms Amazon and BigBasket, as well as the brands themselves showed. These new-age brands include Gourmet Garden, which sells hydroponic fruits and vegetables, and ones such as Kapiva, Oziva, Slurrp Farm, Wow Life Sciences, Yoga Bar and Man Matters, which sell health supplements, snacks and immunity boosters.“Now, people are diverting spends from fancy purchases and non-essentials to higher quality and trustworthy alternatives in food,” said Arjun Balaji, CEO of Gourmet Garden, a Bengaluru-based startup that sells organic items farmed in zero contamination environments.Gourmet Garden has seen a four-times increase in sales compared to pre-Covid-19 levels.“Sales of our leafy greens have shot up several notches to the point where we are short of supply,” Balaji said.Consumers are also choosing to experiment with newer premium brands online, a trend that is hard to replicate in an offline setting dominated by large brands. Hari Menon, CEO of BigBasket, said the spike in healthy eating has been the starkest trend in post-lockdown ordering.“Customers are trying out new brands in the health space,” he said. For instance, baby food brand Slurrp Farm has registered 200% growth over February, while Ayurveda products brand Kapiva has registered 183% growth on BigBasket alone. Sports and energy drinks as a category grew 1.9 times on the platform.There has been a similar buying pattern on Amazon.The company said searches around the health foods category grew by over 17% compared to pre-Covid times.Within that, emerging brands in the healthy snacks category saw sales spike 2.5 times.Vahdam Tea has seen revenue grow three times in last three months owing to increased consumption of wellness products, chief executive Bala Sarda told ET.Man Matters, a digital health clinic for men launched during the lock-own, has seen over 10,000 customers looking for both products and services for health online.“People are looking for products that are clean, plant-based, Ayurveda-based to include as a part of their daily diet,” said Aarti Gill, founder of Oziva, adding that the brand has seen a 50% increase in sales every month for the last three months.A mix of active content outreach, as well as targeted marketing, has helped in building consumer trust.“What we would achieve in 3-4 years, we were able to achieve in 1.5 years,” Dinika Bhatia, co-founder of Nutty Gritties said. Amazon’s launchpad initiative, which handholds emerging brands, helped Nutty Gritties get constant feedback, visibility, and in turn improve rankings on the platform, Bhatia said. The rising reach of content marketing-driven sales via social media apps like Instagram has also helped build brand awareness.“Post the lockdown, we introduced a series of engaging Instagram live do-it-yourself (DIY) sessions and workshops...Through these sessions, customers get an opportunity to learn useful tips, routines and life hacks on topics (including) ...health, lifestyle,” an Amazon spokesperson said.With the digital economy growing rapidly, the top three categories that will see maximum consumption demand are premium products, health and wellness, and lifestyle and recreation, said management consulting firm BCG.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2236_News_1>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/brands-gain-on-rising-appetite-for-healthy-living/articleshow/77878574.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2236_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "These new-age brands include Gourmet Garden, which sells hydroponic fruits and vegetables, and ones such as Kapiva, Oziva, Slurrp Farm, Wow Life Sciences, Yoga Bar and Man Matters, which sell health supplements, snacks and immunity boosters.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2236_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-77878694,width-300,imgsize-739935,,resizemode-4,quality-100/wellness.jpg"}, {"caption": "amazon-info", "id": "Economictime_PL_2236_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-77883082,quality-100/amazon-info.jpg"}]}

It sees potential turnaround in India Household Insecticides (22 per cent of revenue, 45 per cent of SoTP valuation) driven by (1) regaining lost ground from illicit incense sticks (challenges in sourcing, weakness in wholesale), (2) acceleration in category growth (greater usage given consumer focus on health), (3) continued weakness in competition and (4) new product launches. The brokerage also expects margin benefits from mix improvement (India Household Insecticides is margin accretive) and deflationary input prices. Africa business has a high exposure to consumer discretionary categories and outcomes could be binary. That said, Household Insecticides in Africa, though a long-gestation, could benefit from a management change.The brokerage expects overall market expansion from higher usage by consumers being wary of contracting mosquito borne diseases (malaria, dengue). Competitive intensity could also remain low given Reckitt Benckiser (second largest player in India Household Insecticides with Mortein brand) rolling back the split of its businesses in 2019.

{"title": "After testing out 'Fleets' in India, Twitter launches disappearing tweets globally", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2280_News_0>NEW YORK: Twitter is launching tweets that disappear in 24 hours called \"Fleets\" globally, echoing social media sites like Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram that already have disappearing posts. The company says the ephemeral tweets, which it calls \"fleets\" because of their fleeting nature, are designed to allay the concerns of new users who might be turned off by the public and permanent nature of normal tweets. Fleets can't be retweeted and they won't have \"likes.\" People can respond to them, but the replies show up as direct messages to the original tweeter, not as a public response, turning any back-and-forth into a private conversation instead of a public discussion. Twitter tested the feature in Brazil, Italy, India, and South Korea, before rolling it out globally. <IMG Economictime_PL_2280_News_1>Fleets are a \"lower pressure\" way to communicate \"fleeting thoughts\" as opposed to permanent tweets, Twitter executives Joshua Harris, design director, and Sam Haveson, product manager, said in a blog post. The news comes the same day Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced questions from a Senate Judiciary Committee about how they handled disinformation surrounding the presidential election. Both sites have stepped up action taken against disinformation. Zuckerberg and Dorsey promised lawmakers last month that they would aggressively guard their platforms from being manipulated by foreign governments or used to incite violence around the election results - and they followed through with high-profile steps that angered Trump and his supporters. The new \"Fleets\" feature is reminiscent of Instagram and Facebook \"stories\" and Snapchat's snaps, which let users post short-lived photos and messages. Such features are increasingly popular with social media users looking for smaller groups and and more private chats.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/after-testing-out-fleets-in-india-twitter-launches-disappearing-tweets-globally/articleshow/79274298.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2280_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Fleets are a \"lower pressure\" way to communicate \"fleeting thoughts\" as opposed to permanent tweets.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2280_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-79274385,width-650,imgsize-557326,,resizemode-4,quality-100/fleets-are-a-lower-pressure-way-to-communicate-fleeting-thoughts-as-opposed-to-permanent-tweets-.jpg"}, {"caption": "The new 'Fleets' feature is reminiscent of Instagram and Facebook \"stories\" and Snapchat's snaps", "id": "Economictime_PL_2280_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-79274399,quality-100/the-new-fleets-feature-is-reminiscent-of-instagram-and-facebook-stories-and-snapchats-snaps.jpg"}]}
{"title": "India's motorbike makers face a fork in the road", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2285_News_0>By Anjani TrivediIndia’s motorcycle industry is struggling with an existential problem: Which is better, more for less or less for more?That calculus has become a focal point for the country’s makers of motorbikes, mopeds and scooters, as volumes rise and margins shrink. It’s far from simple for a market that churns out more than 2 million vehicles a month. Sales continued to climb in September compared with a year earlier, data from some of the largest manufacturers showed this week.The size and structure of the industry make it difficult to navigate every twist and turn. Two-wheelers account for around 80 percent of India’s vehicle sales. Motorcycles make up more than 60 percent of the segment, with about 1.5 million units sold per month. Within motorcycles, there are several sub-categories such as commuter and sports bikes, with engines that vary in price, size and power. <IMG Economictime_PL_2285_News_1> Bajaj Auto Ltd., one of India’s largest bike makers, has taken the quantity approach, hoping volumes will tip the balance in its favor. The company is trying to strengthen its hold on the lower-end market, aiming to raise its share to close to 50 percent from the current 35 percent. Bajaj “will be taking aggressive stands in price points” for its entry-level machines, Chief Financial Officer Kevin D’Sa said on an earnings call in July.The company dropped prices earlier this year on its most basic model, the CT100, and its iconic Pulsar brand. But it reversed course after an initial uptick in market share that failed to help the top line. Bajaj then introduced a mid-range, basic version of the Pulsar in June to create more choice for aspirational consumers. That didn’t work either — something the company should have foreseen, having taken this approach when introducing its higher-end Discover and V brands. On the earnings call, Bajaj said it was still a couple years away from tackling this segment again.So the reality is discounts haven’t really helped, even in a market as price-sensitive as India’s. Bajaj’s margins have fallen more than 2 percentage points over the past year.Meanwhile, smaller competitor TVS Motor Co. has resisted price pressures and instead pulled back in the lower-end commuter segment. The company has a few high-end products out like the Radeon and Ntorq for younger riders that have hit the spot. It’s also ramping up premium bikes and scooters ahead of the industry, and is increasing exports to other emerging markets.Scooter sales have been rising faster than motorbikes for TVS and posted their highest-ever number in September, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. TVS’s margins have also shrunk, though. On its earnings call, management prudently shifted the conversation away from prices and market share to cutting costs.Their results may be similar for now, but the difference is that TVS has its eyes on the road ahead while Bajaj is still looking at how to rejig a market of the past.For one thing, competing on price will become tougher. In the near term, costs will be forced up whether bike makers like it or not. Last month, India’s insurance regulator raised the mandatory personal accident cover for two-wheelers. Separately, the Supreme Court mandated that new buyers purchase third-party insurance upfront for a period of five years. Taken together, the cost of a basic motorbike could rise by as much as 20 percent. That’s a steep jump for the segment Bajaj is targeting.In addition, India’s transition by 2020 to the Bharat Stage VI fuel-economy norms is already forcing delays in product launches and will come with capital spending (read: costs) to upgrade technology.India’s armies of two-wheeler buyers aren’t just poorer rural consumers; they include up-and-coming millennials. The bike makers to come out on top will be those that find a niche and keep their finger on the pulse. In this tricky terrain, less may in fact be more.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/indias-motorbike-makers-face-a-fork-in-the-road/articleshow/66079197.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2285_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "TVS has its eyes on the road ahead while Bajaj is still looking at how to rejig a market of the past.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2285_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-66079232,width-300,imgsize-525523,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-8.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-9", "id": "Economictime_PL_2285_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-66079246,quality-100/untitled-9.jpg"}]}
{"title": "How a Bangladesh conglomerate managed to make its FMCG products popular in Northeast and parts of West Bengal", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2298_News_0>Mr Noodles is heartily slurped up in parts of northeast India. Packets of Pran Jhal Muri, Potato Crackers, Dry Cake and Family Toast — possibly unfamiliar names in the rest of the country — fly off the small shops there. Even in Siliguri, West Bengal, if you ask for a mango juice at a shop, you might be handed a Frooto instead of a Frooti. Do you want a litchi-flavoured drink? There is Pran Litchi.These are all products of PRAN — Bangladesh’s largest agribusiness conglomerate, set up four decades ago by a retired army officer, Amjad Khan Chowdhury. And it is in no mood to slow down in neighbouring India.“We have set an ambitious target to grow 10 times (in India) from the current levels in the next five years,” Anjanabha Majumdar, director of PRAN’s Indian subsidiary, Pran Beverages (India), tells ET Magazine over telephone and email.“Many new products are at an advanced stage of commercial launch.” When the company set up a food processing unit in Agartala, Tripura, in 2014, it was the first such Bangladeshi plant in India. They followed it up with a second plant in Kalyani, in West Bengal’s Nadia district, which borders Bangladesh, in 2015. “A third manufacturing facility is likely to be set up in the next quarter. Meanwhile, an expansion programme is on the anvil in north Bengal where negotiations to acquire a commercial shed are at an advanced stage,” says Majumdar.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2298_News_1>He, however, refuses to divulge the company’s revenue from India operations, adding that Assam and Tripura have been its key markets. He claims that at least one of their products, Pran Dry Cake, is a market leader in the segment in the region.Bangladesh is finding a growing market in the region, thanks to its booming economy and India’s zero import duties. Interestingly, this has been unfolding even as the Northeast, particularly Assam, has been protesting against illegal migration from the neighbouring country, with the agitation peaking during the recent antiCAA demonstrations.Bangladesh’s economy has been growing rapidly since 2014, with its GDP growth hovering around 8% in 2019. The country recently hit the headlines when the IMF’s World Economic Outlook projected that its per capita GDP was set to surpass India’s in the Covid year of 2020 — quite a feat, considering Bangladesh was earlier branded as an impoverished, underdeveloped nation. (India is supposed to bounce back in 2021, according to the report, surpassing Bangladesh once again. Also, India’s per capita GDP in terms of purchasing power parity is still 11 times more than that of Bangladesh, according to 2019 data.)  Apart from PRAN, the big Bangladeshi companies, some of which have global operations, are BEXIMCO, ACI, Navana and Bashundhara. PRAN’s push is causing worries on this side of the border, though. Ashish Deorah, cofounder of Meghalaya-based Excel Foods that manufactures Yummy Noodles, which competes with Mr Noodles, says the Northeast has become a “dumping ground” for processed fruits and food from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal.Rumpum, a noodles brand from Nepal, for example, is the market leader in Nagaland. Meanwhile, Indian micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) cannot easily explore markets in Bangladesh even when they boast geographical proximity because of the steep duties slapped by the latter, says Deorah, who is also the national secretary of Laghu Udyog Bharati, a national-level association of MSMEs. Deorah says it has submitted several memoranda to the Union ministry of commerce and industry, highlighting Bangladesh’s duties that virtually block India’s agri and food processing products from reaching its markets.“Our processed products are not at all competitive in Bangladesh due to the exorbitant duties. Meanwhile, if a Bangladeshi company exports, say, juices to India, it pays only the GST, which is 12%, and zero import duties,” he says, adding that an Indian exporter to Bangladesh ends up paying 45% as duties (customs duties plus special duties) for juices, 55% for cereal products and 60% for sweet biscuits. The only way out for Indian companies is to set up a factory in Bangladesh to escape duties. But that again would be a costly proposition. <IMG Economictime_PL_2298_News_2>While local MSMEs are concerned about competition from Bangladesh, FMCG and agri-business major ITC, which has a good presence in eastern and northeastern India, is not. “ITC’s extensive distribution infrastructure is enabling it to expand reach and penetration in eastern and northeastern region. FMCG brands in the foods and personal care segments from the neighbouring countries have not made any significant inroads in this region,” says an ITC spokesperson.PRAN’s growing clout in the Northeast can’t be downplayed. In Tripura, it is the largest private sector employer. Its factory employs about 700 people apart from providing indirect jobs to many more.The problem, say MSME entrepreneurs in the Northeast, is not Bangladeshi companies setting up factories in the region. “We don’t have any problem if a company from Bangladesh establishes a factory in India and sells goods in the Northeast. The problem arises when it imports most of its products from Bangladesh where the input cost is very less. And India charges them zero import duties,” says Deorah, adding how PRAN’s litchi drink, manufactured in Bangladesh, is a big challenge to many local entrepreneurs.PRAN’s India subsidiary is called Pran Beverages (India), but the one thing it doesn’t produce are beverages. As Deorah says, probably, it still makes business sense for the company to import some products from Bangladesh rather than roll out their production in India.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/how-a-bangladesh-conglomerate-managed-to-make-its-fmcg-products-popular-in-parts-of-india/articleshow/78970459.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2298_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "PRAN’s growing clout in the Northeast can’t be downplayed.

{"title": "Can Hero Cycles' new electric cycle help it power ahead?", "body": "Pankaj Munjal arrived at work somewhat sleep deprived on a recent Thursday morning. He had arrived on a red-eye flight from Germany earlier that day. But at One Horizon Centre, the upscale Gurgaon office complex where his office is based, a fire drill was underway. It would be a while before he could start work at his office, the nerve centre of India’s largest cycle maker, the 62-year-old Hero Cycles Ltd.Munjal is the custodian of a formidable legacy — the company founded by his father OP Munjal and his brothers was the first in what would become the sprawling Hero two-wheeler empire, now held by different branches of the Munjal family. Hero Cycles was once the world’s largest bicycle manufacturer. Now, while it enjoys a 40% share of the Indian market, Hero Cycles is faced with stagnating growth. The market is growing at just 2%. The mainstay Roadster, the sturdy bicycle used by millions of Indians to commute, has saturated as a segment. In pricier urban segments that are rapidly growing, Indian bicycle makers are facing stiff competition from Chinese and other foreign companies. <IMG Economictime_PL_2379_News_0> Hero Cycles’ sales actually fell by 12% in 2016-17. Profits at the company declined by 57%, from Rs 58.46 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 25.15 crore in 2016-17. (The HMC group of companies under Pankaj Munjal recorded a turnover of Rs 2,496 crore in 2016-17 with profit before tax of Rs 114 cr) These headwinds mean Munjal must get the company to pedal harder and make some sharp turns. While he’s attempting some pivotal shifts in strategy, he has made two acquisitions, Firefox in India and Avocet Sports in UK. There is one challenge that is seemingly insurmountable — Indians don’t particularly like cycling.Munjal recalls a dinner engagement in Brussels some five years ago. As he and his wife Charu got ready to leave, the hosts, local friends of the family, arrived pedalling cycles, with two additional cycles in tow. All four of them, with Charu Munjal wearing heels, pedalled away to the restaurant in their evening best. It’s common in western European cities to cycle everywhere. In China, 37% of households own a bicycle. In Scandinavia, household ownership of bicycles is at 110%, meaning, many households have more than one bicycle. In India, this figure is 9%. Some 1.7 crore cycles are sold in India every year, culminating in sales of Rs 6,500-7,000 crore, say industry estimates. <IMG Economictime_PL_2379_News_1>  <IMG Economictime_PL_2379_News_2> With stagnating sales, Hero Cycles is now pursuing a two-pronged strategy. The first part involves e-bicycles, which can run on battery power, pedal power, or a combination of the two. And the second part involves launching a model in the Roadster segment that is significantly cheaper than existing options. It’s offering affordability at the price sensitive end of the market, and innovation at the top end.Uphill rideThe largest segment of the bicycle industry in India (17 million bicycles a year), is the Roadster, accounting for some 55-60% (9-10 million units) of sales. This segment may well be not seeing growth. It is also losing out to motorised two-wheelers, which, unlike cheap cycles (Rs 3,500-5,000), can be bought on EMIs. There is, however, an unlikely lifeline that has been keeping the segment alive. State governments like to give away cycles under various schemes and the Roadster remains the popular option.The other end of the spectrum is the urban biking segment, where bicycles are bought as a hobby or for exercising. This is seeing a massive 25% growth. Known as the fancy segment in industry parlance, these cycles make up another 25% of the market. The remaining 15% are bicycles for kids. The super-premium segment, where bicycles are priced more than motorcycles, is also seeing a 20% annual growth. Overall, in the past five years, the industry has experienced alternative years of growth and slump. <IMG Economictime_PL_2379_News_3> In the Indian market, Hero’s leadership position, with 28% (does not include Firefox) share, is followed by TI Cycles (23%), Avon (15%) and Atlas (13%). Because of stagnation, there are internecine battles.Hero and Avon have just settled a dispute around a particular design for bicycles. Hero had alleged that Avon had copied its design, and had filed a lawsuit in 2016. Again in 2016, there was a dispute within the Munjal family on the use of the Hero brand. Hero Ecotech, a company owned by the Vijay Munjal arm of the family, sells cycles under the Kross brand. Vijay Munjal is Pankaj Munjal’s cousin.The industry also sees pressure mounting from foreign brands such as Giant, Phoenix or Trek. China-made cycles have also made their presence felt in the market, and AICMA feels there is some underinvoicing happening with imports from China. KB Thakur, secretary general of the AICMA, was recently in Shanghai and feels there is a trick or two that India is missing out on. In Shanghai, Thakur says, there were plenty of aged cyclists, of 70 years or more, cycling through demarcated lanes on busy roads. In India, there are hardly any cities with dedicated cycling lanes.The AICMA has lobbied the government for a national bicycle policy and also the creation of a bicycle development council. It has made representations to the Prime Minister’s Office, too. The letter to the prime minister has pointed out the low percentage of Indian households that own a bicycle. The letter has also urged the prime minister to set up a National Urban Active Travel Ways Authority of India through an act of Parliament. Thakur says that as bicycling does not come under any ministry, there is no one looking after the sector’s interests. <IMG Economictime_PL_2379_News_4> As for Hero Cycles, Munjal is now betting big on a new model, called Lectro. It’s a hybrid of sorts. It looks like a regular bicycle but has a battery hidden inside its frame. On a single charge, which takes 3.5 hours, the bicycle can run 30-40 km, depending on the terrain. Using a mode shifter, a user can choose to run it fully on battery power, pedal power or a mix. It retails for Rs 27,000. It can be charged from a regular plug point with a charging cable that comes with the cycle. Munjal says he had the chance to show the new e-cycle to Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was in London in April. The cycle has been developed at the company’s design centre in London. “The PM had a few snappy questions for us, like how long it takes to charge, and how long a charge lasts,” Munjal says.The Lectro weights around 14.8 kg, about the same as a cooking gas cylinder. It can also be acquired for a down payment of 5,000. Hero has tied up with multiple partners for the financing. This first model is aimed at the urban market and at those who like to cycle as a hobby. The company is planning new versions that will let users lock or unlock the bike from a mobile app and also recharge the battery using the energy generated during the braking action, akin to the regenerative braking technology used in cars.Munjal also plans to launch versions of the e-cycle aimed at other market segments. He plans to launch two-wheeler load carriers, and doesn’t rule out battery-powered threewheelers either. However, apart from expanding the market at the top end, the e-bicycle will also help differentiate Hero Cycles in a segment that is getting busier. Apart from the Lectro, Hero also has the Firefox brand in its stable as well as other premium brands such as Hero Sprint.While this segment is witnessing rapid growth, the competition is also stiff and increasingly global. American bicycle maker Trek, for instance, has been in India for a while. Its bicycles are priced between Rs 25,000 and Rs 3.5 lakh. The products are available on EMIs. Navneet Banka, the country head for Trek, says: “We are very bullish on the super-premium market in India and we will strongly promote cycling for this segment.”Hawkish Stance The other prong of Hero Cycle’s new strategy is a product called the Hawk — a sturdy Roadster priced significantly lower than rival models in the market. The company is aiming to sell it at Rs 1999. Munjal recounts the genesis of the Hawk and why pushing the price point lower became necessary. At a meeting with the then prime minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P Chidambaram, Munjal says, the bicycle industry had explained how the rural segment that usually bought cycles was now keen to upgrade to motorised two-wheelers.While the government of the day saw this as a story of poverty alleviation, Munjal felt there was a still a segment that wanted a cycle but could not afford it. Hero decided to target this segment and bring the price down further. The cycle design was tinkered with to make it lighter by changing the welding and grades of steel used. And to help finance the bicycle, Hero Cycles is tying up with self-help groups. The Hawk is already being tried in some villages in Rajasthan and will be commercially launched sometime later in the year. “It is lighter, but it is still good enough for a milk man to carry his milk cans around,” Munjal adds, hinting at who the target customer might be.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/can-hero-cycles-new-electric-cycle-help-it-power-ahead/articleshow/65084660.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2379_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2379_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65084857,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2379_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65084912,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_2379_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65084917,quality-100/2.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2379_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65084963,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_2379_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65084970,quality-100/2.jpg"}]}

Fund-III is a spiritual successor to the first two funds, doing what we do best - and good companies at an early-stage, covering seed to Series A,” Pranav Pai , founding partner at 3one4 Capital, told ET in an exclusive chat. Fund-III is a Sebi-registered Category-I venture capital fund that has been backed by a significant number of investors that have also backed 3one4 Capital’s earlier investment vehicles. According to Pai, a majority of the Limited Partners in Fund-III are of Indian origin. For its Continuum Fund, 3one4 Capital had roped in Emory Investment Management — the $7 billion US endowment that manages the assets of Emory University, Emory Healthcare, and The Carter Center — as one of its anchor investors. <IMG Economictime_PL_2378_News_1>“We should be backing more companies, and could end up with 25 companies at least with Fund-III. Global LPs now have no problems coming into Indian funds., given the easing of regulations,” Pai said, without disclosing the names of the investors in Fund-III. The firm, which has over 50 companies in its portfolio, has made the first close of the new fund at $40 million, and will now manage assets of about Rs 1,550 crore, almost double of what it had a year ago. The investment theme for the new fund will be a continuation from its earlier funds, and which include placing bets in sectors, such as SaaS and enterprise automation, direct-to-consumer, media and Content, fintech, and deep technology among others. “With this new fund, 3one4 Capital is purpose-built to be deeply involved across the lifecycle of the next innovation engines from India. Our deep involvement model is designed to help founders optimize for sustainable growth by serving as a force multiplier on the path towards defensible long-term value creation,” Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital, said.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2378_News_2>“We do not have any Chinese affiliates as of now, and nor do we intend to actually change this anytime in the future. We have had opportunities in the past. But It’s also very important for Indian funds to be aligned and aware of the greater macroeconomic implications,” he added.Prior to launching its latest fund, 3one4 Capital had launched four previous funds, also of which have been oversubscribed. Its first fund, launchd in 2016 closed at Rs 100 crore while it launched its second fund in 2017, with a target of Rs 150 crore, finally closing at Rs 250 crore. The firm counts the likes of consumer product company Licious, mobility startup Yulu, new-age banking startup Jupiter and enterprise HR software solutions company Darwinbox among its portfolio. It has had three exits till date - Jigsaw Academy, Ressy and JustDoc - all of which were acquired.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/3one4-capital-launches-new-100-million-fund/articleshow/77886782.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2378_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Prior to launching its latest fund, 3one4 Capital had launched four previous funds, also of which have been oversubscribed.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2378_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-77887031,width-300,imgsize-75083,,resizemode-4,quality-100/money-istock.jpg"}, {"caption": "PRANAV-PAI---3ONE4-CAPITAL", "id": "Economictime_PL_2378_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-77887045,quality-100/pranav-pai-3one4-capital.jpg"}, {"caption": "SIDDARTH-PAI---3ONE4-CAPITA", "id": "Economictime_PL_2378_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-77887055,quality-100/siddarth-pai-3one4-capita.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Royal Enfield focusses on its own branded gears and accessories as the new growth engine", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2432_News_0>In the quest to milk its iconic motorcycle brand Royal Enfield, widely called Bullet, the favourite of the best bikers in India, its owner Eicher Motors is adopting a strategy that mirrors what other iconic brands have successfully monetised.Royal Enfield is not just a bike. The company wants to create a new revenue stream by selling its own branded gears, accessories, apparels and more. Royal Enfield gear like T-shirts and helmets can be found in standalone stores at Khan Market in Delhi or in Colaba, Mumbai, where the core business is just gears and accessories and not bikes.The non-motorcycle business (spares, apparel’s, accessories etc) accounted for 8% of Royal Enfield’s total business in FY-17, which is estimated to have crossed 10% in FY-18 and Eicher sees it more than doubling in the next five years. People in the know say it could potentially be a $800 million to a billion dollar business - about the same size as Ferrari’s non car business or Harley Davidson or Triumph motorcycles - i.e. a quarter of the total revenues.As the riding culture grows in India, motorcycling is becoming a way of life say biking connoisseurs. Owning a brand like a Royal Enfield, Triumph or Harley is a fashion statement now. Not surprisingly, the company is ensuring that its gears and apparels are found in upmarket locations across the country. Royal Enfield gears, T-shirts, jackets, helmets and shoes can be found in standalone stores of Khan Market in Delhi or in Colaba, Mumbai, where the core business is just gears and not bikes.Apart from standalone stores, the company has gradually seeded itself in retail chains like the Central Mall across half a dozen locations, which eventually will turn into double digits, where Royal Enfield will retail its gears, helmet and apparels amongst other things.Speaking on the sidelines of Royal Enfield Classic 500 Pegasus limited edition launch, Samrat Som, head, apparel and accessories business at Royal Enfield told ET “the whole idea is how do you convert the newly converted motorcycling chap? Inspire him to adopt motorcycling as his “way of life?” through the apparels and accessories the company is constantly able to engage with the customer during the entire ownership lifecycle, says Som. <IMG Economictime_PL_2432_News_1> Som declined to give the numbers but agreed on the potential growth of 100s of millions of dollars.“I can’t quote numbers but these are potential opportunities. We know that a successful motorcycle business like ours could have a sizable turnover coming from non-motorcycle business like global peers,” added Som.And the potential is something that has begun to look apparent. At 8 lakh units, Royal Enfield branded helmet was the fourth largest brand in the country in FY-18. In the year gone, Royal Enfield sold more than 1 lakh riding gears and 8 lakh helmets. For every 7 motorcycles that Royal Enfield sold last year, it sold one gear.The company says usually jackets and helmets are considered purchase decision, but out of its experience of selling gears and accessories, the company has started getting a lot of impulse buying at these retail stores. Interestingly 33% of the total helmet sales come from the central departmental store for the company. Eicher is focussing on high footfall areas or malls to generate additional business. It is also in discussion with several other mall majors like Phoenix for further expansion.All this is apart from more than 800 touch points – which will cross 1000 in few years where it sells gears, apparels, shoes in some form or the other. Royal Enfield is also leveraging the online platform to give access to brand Royal Enfield, apart from its own online platform. The company sells its merchandise through Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra among others. Sales through ecommerce accounts for 16% of the total non-motorcycle business.Vimal Sumbly, managing director of Triumph India Motorcycles, said 12.5% of his company’s revenues come from non-motorcycle business of gears, accessories, parts and that segment of business has been doubling every year.“Globally, bike majors enjoy about 15% to 25% of their total revenue from gears and accessories business, but the potential in India is huge. Our nonmotorcycle business should touch 20% in the next three years,” added Sumbly.Triumph has been increasing its fashion clothing collection rapidly and with every new launch, the company offers over 50 customisation or accessorisation option to its customers. Triumph has summer, winter and core biking clothing options. The apparels are no more restricted just for the male rider. Either. There are options available for the entire family including the women and kids.Indian brands can potentially enjoy almost a third of their business from allied segments, which is double of the global average thanks to the huge bike park and growing number of millennials, said the head of Triumph Motorcycles in India. “The youth of today is not buying a product; he or she is buying into the brand.They are buying into a lifestyle. Their understanding of brand is very sharp and they like to express and indulge themselves. All this presents a huge opportunity for motorcycle brands like ours to keep them engaged with the brand,” added Sumbly.This area of business is a big space for vehicle makers to tap into and these are highly margin accretive to the business as well.Even for a new entrant like Ducati which entered in 2013, the share of apparels and accessories already accounts for 16-21% of the overall market. “It is a very important part of business and an avenue to build a brand. We always say, that when you sell a bike, you dont sell just the bike, you also need to sell accessories along with it. There are hundreds of options available for a rider to personalise his bike. He can buy add ons that match his personality or the kind of ride he prefers - on road, off road, ride on the hills, appropriate accessories are available to enhance the ride,”said Sergi Canovas, MD at Ducati India Pvt Limited.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/royal-enfield-plans-to-create-a-revenue-stream-in-by-selling-its-own-branded-gears-and-accessories/articleshow/64515559.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2432_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "This area of business is a big space for vehicle makers to tap into and these are highly margin accretive to the business as well.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2432_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-64515684,width-300,imgsize-147277,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2432_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64515590,quality-100/untitled-1.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Hero MotoCorp must prepare for a showdown as it faces aggressive new competitors in scooter & premium segments", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2448_News_0>They said it was an amicable enough divorce — as divorces go — though it had its share of shock and awe, as would the end to any 26-year-old partnership. But it is Hero MotoCorp chairman Pawan Munjal’s own admission that splitting with Honda was a “against conventional wisdom.” Rather like its Hollywood counterpart, ‘The Breakup’ has left both partners squaring up for a share of the same turf.Seven years on, Hero’s market share has slipped to 37%, from 44%. Even that is considered optimistic, given that not many people gave this partner a chance after the separation. Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI), more predictably, has galloped to 29% market share, from 13%. It’s a showdown, no doubt.At a recent annual dealer convention at the Al Sahra Desert Resort on the outskirts of Dubai, the Hero chief had a word of caution. “In a world driven by ‘disruptive’ ideas, our future competition is not just going to come from our usual industry peers. It may not even come from any of the automotive companies that exist today. Some startup tech companies may come up from nowhere to disrupt the industry drastically,” Munjal warned.He may well worry. Munjal knows his task is cut out to retain the mainstream market. Although it still commands more than 70% market share in the commuter (mass market) motorcycle segment, Hero MotoCorp’s presence has been bitten off at both ends by simultaneous ‘scooterisation’ and popularisation of premium segment motorcycles. Honda’s trump card — the Activa, for the first-time buyer — played out and earned it leadership position and 55% market share in scooters.As scooterisation rode the crest, the share of mass market motorcycles narrowed the volume gap between scooters and entry-level motorcycles to a mere 4%. At the end of FY18, automatic scooters accounted for 33% of overall market, against 20% in 2011-12, whereas 100cc motorcycle contributed 37% in 2017-18, compared with 49% in FY12. In fact, HMSI began the new fiscal with record sales, bringing down the gap with Hero to just 41,491 units in the domestic two-wheeler market, albeit for just one month.SALES Market share in (), %   The gap was 1.47 million units per annum at end of FY18, a record year for Hero. It sold 7.6 million motorcycles and scooters, and began FY19 with 16% growth in April, giving indication of yet another year of double-digit growth. Hero remains the third-largest scooter player in the country, behind TVS and HMSI. It currently has three models in its scooters portfolio — the Pleasure, Maestro Edge and Duet. It will soon launch upgraded 125cc versions, Duet 125 and Maestro Edge 125. Recent scooter price reductions by the company resulted in its market share rising to 15.2% in March 2018, from 13.2% in December. Nonetheless, experts feel there is scope for more.A recent HDFC Securities report notes, “The management believes Hero MotoCorp is underrepresented in the scooter and premium motorcycle segments. Launches would facilitate overall market share gain. The Xtreme 200R and Xpulse 200 will test HMCL’s market competency going ahead, in the premium market segment.” An upgrade is on Munjal’s mind too. “As the market leader,” he had said at Al Sahra, “we should be the one driving …technological change. We are working on an entire range of new mobility solutions. To start with, you will soon see a range of premium products.” <IMG Economictime_PL_2448_News_1> THE BIG PREMIUM PUSHThe world’s largest two-wheeler maker is chaffing at the erosion in its share of the domestic premium motorcycle segment, from 15-16% a decade ago to low single digits today. The rapid launches of youthful motorcycles by Japanese and homegrown competitors alike overtook its top performers, Xtreme, Hunk, Achiever, ZMR and Karizma.This has led to a series of measures by Hero MotoCorp to get back in the fast lane, including a range of premium launches lined up for this year. Company officials declined to divulge the details but a top Mumbai-based dealer says on condition of anonymity, “We have been told that as many as four new premium motorcycles are coming this year. All are going to be on the 200cc platform.”Hero has had to take several measures after the Honda breakup, one of the first being strengthening its research and development (R&D), at the Centre of Innovation and Technology (CIT) in Jaipur. “The CIT saw investment of $120 million,” says an executive associated with the company, requesting anonymity. “but there is pressure to deliver products beyond commuter segments, where Hero has no significant presence.” <IMG Economictime_PL_2448_News_2> Hero’s 49% stake in the US-based and now-bankrupt Erik Buell Racing (EBR) also didn’t help. That not only pulled back Hero’s new product range by several years but has also left the company to deliver products across segments in a short span of time. Already, it is working overtime to plug gaps in scooters and premium motorcycles alongwith ensuring that the BS VI solutions are ready in time by 2020.BMW veteran Markus Brauns--perger, Hero roped in as chief technology officer three years ago, to lead its 600-strong multinational R&D team, says Hero has “taken a strategic call to focus a lot more on the premium 200-300cc segment.” “We will move up the value chain gradually,” he adds. “The Xtreme 200R and XPulse —the anywhere bike — are reflective of our product development capabilities.” “The premium motorcycle segment – particularly sub-Rs 1 lakh — is an attractive market,” says Malo Le Masson, head, global product planning, Hero MotoCorp. “Our product strategy is to meet customer needs, rather than have multiple products at a gap of every 10cc.”Munjal is personally driving the premiumisation agenda, which includes starting a chain of premium outlets and branded merchandise. “The New Hero is all about technology and youth,” says the chairman. “When I talk of premium, I mean not only products, but also a completely premium makeover.” Market watchers, however, caution Hero to take the gradient to premiumisation in first gear. “It is a prudent strategy to first concentrate on the 200-250 cc segment, which was Hero’s space not too long ago, and then aim for the higher categories,” says Mahantesh Sabarad, head, retail research, SBI Cap Securities.VERSUS HONDAIn 2013, Shinji Aoyama, then chief operating officer of Honda’s global motorcycle business, claimed that HMSI would overtake Hero to become market leader by 2015. He continues to hedge on that statement. HMSI senior vice-president, sales and marketing, YS Guleria was far blunter in his acknowledgement of his company’s number 2 position. Asked if HMSI is poised to overtake Hero in the near future, Guleria says, “We just don’t have the capacity.Even if we decide to add a new assembly line, it will take at least two years to go on-stream. So the question doesn’t arise as of now.” According to a report by HSBC Securities and Capital Markets, “Despite competition and a weak presence in the premium market, Hero has strongly defended its domestic motorcycle market share over past five years, keeping it in the narrow 51-53% range. ”This is not to say Hero can rest on its laurels. “We will continue to set benchmarks in developing new technologies for the future of mobility,” Munjal had said earlier. “We will also keep expanding our global footprint.” The benchmarks including a presence in 50 global markets and its vision to surpass 10 million units in annual sales by 2020.CAPEX IS THE WAYHaving lost out to its main rival in states high on urbanisation and scooter markets, Hero has been ramping up manufacturing facilities, gearing up to take installed capacity to 11 million units of motorcycles and scooters per annum. As K Srinivas, cofounder, WheelsEMI, and former president of the motorcycle business at Bajaj Auto, says, “People who are writing off Hero as a strong player are underestimating power of the brand.It is more difficult to build the brand than to build the engine. The challenge (for Hero) would be in transitioning to bigger bikes and scooters, where the market is moving to.” But with its erstwhile partner pulling up beside it, Munjal’s company may find it tough to live up to its name.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/hero-motocorp-must-prepare-for-a-showdown-as-it-faces-aggressive-new-competitors-in-scooter-premium-segments/articleshow/64266646.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2448_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The rapid launches of youthful motorcycles by Japanese and homegrown competitors alike overtook its top performers, Xtreme, Hunk, Achiever, ZMR and Karizma.

Rupesh Bhansali, head-mutual funds, GEPL Capital, said, “It is relatively safe to invest in the government's debt ETF. It has low expense ratio and sovereign support which reduces default risks. These instruments are likely to have high liquidity as strategic investors such as pension funds will also invest in them.” <IMG Economictime_PL_2468_News_1> According to the data from Value Research, after the drop in inflows into debt schemes for two consecutive years to 2018, inflows in debt schemes turned positive to Rs 70,872 crore in 2019. Inflows in government securities too ended at Rs 625 crore during the same period after falling in the previous two years.“When compared to insurance products, the debt ETF is likely to provide higher returns after taking into account the taxes,” said Radhika Gupta, CEO, Edelweiss Asset Management, which recently launched a corporate bond ETF called Bharat Bond ETF According to S Shankar, CFP, Credo Capital, the posttax returns on insurance products hover at 4-5 per cent compared with 6-6.6 per cent for debt ETFs after considering indexation.The maturity period will be a crucial factor for debt ETFs according to a fund manager who did not want to be named. “Lower duration (3-year, 5-year) ETFs generate stronger response from investors than high duration ETFs (10-year),\" he said.This is reflected in the response to the recent Bharat Bond ETF launched by Edelweiss Mutual Fund. The 3-year category ETF was subscribed 2.3 times while it was 1.4 times for the 10-year category ETF.Fund managers and distributors expect the government to raise Rs 30,000-50,000 crore in the next one year and Rs 10,000-15,000 crore in six months through debt ETF.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/why-debt-etf-is-a-better-choice-than-insurance-products/articleshow/73949948.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2468_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Investment safety and possibility of better returns in times of economic slowdown are some of the reasons which may attract retail investors towards the debt ETFs.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2468_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-73949943,width-300,imgsize-945769,,resizemode-4,quality-100/etf-shutterstock_1130598437.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2468_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-73949955,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}

After gaining 13 per cent in the three months to February 7, its stock has lost nearly 12 per cent in the past seven trading sessions. In addition, the December quarter performance reflects pressure on the margin due to rising raw material costs and higher marketing and advertising expenses. While the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant may report a sustained topline growth in the coming quarters due to introduction of new products, analysts expect lower profitability.The stock trades at a peak valuation – 60 times trailing earnings and 55 times forward earnings. With a weak December quarter performance, it is unlikely that the stock would be able to sustain such a valuation. Besides, most mutual funds are caught on the wrong side with their holding in the counter at a multi-year high of 3.1 per cent. Most of this addition was done during the December quarter. The stock’s valuation data for the last five years shows that it has not been able to sustain the valuation above 55 times earnings.<IMG Economictime_PL_2479_News_1> For the company, which has December ending financial year, 2018 was one of the finest years in terms of profitability with nearly 25 per cent EBIDTA margin, the highest in the last 10 years.

In the December quarter, EBIDTA margin dropped to 20.7 per cent -- a year-on-year drop of 380 basis points. The earnings dropped by 2 per cent compared with an estimated growth of 15 per cent.A higher marketing costs on new products was the major reason of margin contraction.

{"title": "Battered by competition, Intex plans to make products for Chinese firms", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2485_News_0>KOLKATA: This may be a classic case of ‘if you can’t beat them, join them’.Bowing down to the Chinese handset brands which has almost wiped away the domestic mobile phone industry, the second largest home grown maker Intex Technologies is now planning to contract manufacture for the Chinese to make a turnaround.Intex promoter and director Keshav Bansal said in the light of tariff war between the US and China, few Chinese companies are in final talks with Intex for manufacturing and export of products to USA from India. This, he expects, will be one of the key strategy to revive the company. Intex has been badly hit by Chinese brigade of Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Intel and Realme.In 2018-19, Intex Technologies has become a third of what it was in FY17 as per its latest filings with Registrar of Companies sourced from Veratech Intelligence. Revenue from operations plunged by 52% to Rs 1,387.3 crore in FY19 as compared to the previous fiscal.Intex sales has been declining year-on-year after touching a peak of Rs 6,233 crore in FY16 due to the entry of Chinese brands. The company, which was profitable all this while, also plunged into losses last fiscal posting net loss of Rs 281.3 crore as compared to a net profit of Rs 13.8 crore in 2017-18. <IMG Economictime_PL_2485_News_1> The senior executive of another erstwhile leading Indian brand, who requested anonymity, said the company is also working with a Chinese contract manufacturer. He said Chinese companies are only looking at partnership with Indian firms who have their own manufacturing plant to utilise it.“It is difficult to match China in scale and speed. We cannot compete with the Chinese in the cost of assembling which goes to a low of Rs 30-35 per unit for feature phones and Rs 100-Rs 250 per unit for smartphones without SMT assembling,” he said.Veratech’s founder Mohit Yadav said one-third of Intex’s turnover comes from cellphones where it is facing stiff competition from Chinese brands. “This has led to a sharp decline in the company’s revenue and net profit. Company’s USP is value for money where Chinese have an upper hand, and it will need a completely new strategy to revitalize growth,” he said.Bansal said the entry of Jio, Chinese players and predatory pricing by ecommerce players have triggered this decline of revenues of all Indian handset companies. He said Intex has planned new products for launch in 2020 such as those with artificial intelligence, smart home and office solutions, security surveillance products, personal care, smart watches and fitness bands.As per market trackers, Indian handset brands share in the smartphone market has come down to less than 3% in July to September as compared to 8% same period last year with five brands – Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, Realme and Oppo – together controlling over 87% of the market.The Indian brands have less than 1% share in smartphones, while in feature phones Lava and Karbonn have managed to stay in the league of top five.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/battered-by-competition-intex-plans-to-make-products-for-chinese-firms/articleshow/72432337.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2485_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Intex sales has been declining year-on-year after touching a peak of Rs 6,233 crore in FY16 due to the entry of Chinese brands.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2485_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-72432421,width-650,imgsize-17101,,resizemode-4,quality-100/intex-agencies.jpg"}, {"caption": "graph", "id": "Economictime_PL_2485_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-72432435,quality-100/graph.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Toyota, Maruti, Tata Motors and auto giants are stopping production of some models", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2496_News_0>Mumbai: Come April 1, some of the popular passenger vehicles to run on Indian roads will go missing as auto manufacturers are rationalising the number of vehicles they produce given the high cost of transition to BS-VI variants. Some of the models to go off the shelf include the Etios, Liva, Corolla Altis from Toyota, KUV100 diesel variant and Bolero Plus from Mahindra, Hexa, Safari Storme, Zest, Bolt and all the older generation cars of Tata Motors, Maruti and Renault diesel cars. While Hyundai has transitioned most of its models to BS-VI, only the Xcent (prime) diesel, which catered to the fleet segment, will be discontinued. Instead, the Korean auto major has launched the Xcent CNG variant for the fleet segment.Industry executives believe that OEMs would replace the vehicles with newer models and variants. With the clamour for gasoline engines growing, auto companies may look at such products in lieu of diesel-powered vehicles, say experts.“At Mahindra, we are upgrading most of our current portfolio to BS-VI along with planned new product launches and a couple of limited volume variants that are getting discontinued on account of BS-VI will be replaced with some of our other existing products,” said Veejay Nakra, head of sales & marketing of Mahindra’s automotive division. The Bolero Plus 9 seater people mover and Plus Ambulance will be discontinued. The KUV100 diesel will be discontinued since the XUV300 is the flagship offering in the compact SUV segment. The KUV100 on gasoline and bi-fuel (gasoline-CNG) variants will continue, adds Nakra. <IMG Economictime_PL_2496_News_1> It is, however, no surprise that companies are using the BS-VI transition to quietly retire products which did not perform well in the market . Naveen Soni, Sr VP – sales & service of Toyota Kirloskar confirming the discontinuance of Liva and Etios, said “We always study and evaluate the market, continue to understand customer preferences and trends. This also applies to cases when we have to discontinue an existing model to vacate plant capacity for advanced and better technologies to come in. In order to service the needs of our customers, we are now offering Yaris and Glanza in BS-VI avatar against the discontinued Liva and Etios respectively. Apart from the Etios series, we will also be discontinuing the Corolla Altis, having seen a conscious shift in customer preferences from the C sedan segment to C MPV segment.”Automobile companies need to see through a prism of commercial viability and the future of the product. Decisions are taken product-wise and the costs involved upgrading the product, said Arun Kumar, ex Nissan India head & auto consultant.The country’s largest vehicle manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki, however, seems to be unfazed. Shashank Srivastava, ED, (marketing and sales), said “Maruti is manufacturing BS6 vehicles from end January 2020 and this transition from BS-IV to BS-VI was planned a year in advance. Best-selling mass models such as Alto and Baleno were upgraded with BS-VI petrol engines in April 2019. This was closely followed by WagonR, Swift and Dzire in June 2019 and Ertiga in July 2019, XL6 in August 2019, S-PRESSO in September 2019; Eeco, Celerio, Super Carry, Ciaz in January 2020 and Vitara Brezza, IGNIS in February 2020. We had also announced end of BS-IV diesel vehicles nearly a year in advance so that our customers have an informed choice on fuel type.”Tata Motors declined to comment. Sources in the know said while Tata Motors will do away with older generation cars, and the focus will be on Nexon, Altroz, Tiago, Tigor, Harrier and the EV segment.Vendors have also been helping and working towards upgrading variants of petrol, CNG, manual/automatic transmission or AMT to BS-VI.

{"title": "Companies see cash as king, cut capex plans", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2546_News_0>MUMBAI: Bogged down by the coronavirus-related lockdowns, India Inc has decided to adopt a strategy of financial prudence for the new fiscal year. As costs remain constant while incomes decline, companies across sectors are revisiting their capital expenditure (capex) programmes. ‘Cash is king’ is the new mantra corporates are strictly abiding by, as they delay heavy investment plans, revise their sales budgets and bring their cost plans to a new realistic Covid-19 normal.JSW Energy director (finance) Jyoti Kumar Agarwal said the company is revisiting all its plans, operational as well as strategic, in light of the pandemic. “Much like non-essential travel, we have decided to put off any non-essential, discretionary expenditure for the moment. We are also redrawing our strategic road map in the near term while keeping a nimble approach given the rapidly evolving circumstances. While we do have sufficient liquidity to last through a prolonged dislocation, we would nevertheless prefer to conserve as much capital as possible given the unprecedented nature of the situation.”Some industries, like cement, move in tandem with the GDP growth numbers. “We expect this quarter of fiscal 2021 to be a damper for the industry and hope to see strong signs of revival in the third quarter,” said Birla Corporation COO Sandip Ghose. Normalcy could return only in the fourth quarter. “Costs that are postponable, will be postponed. When we are not selling anything, we don’t need to spend on on-ground marketing activities,” said Ghose. Power and transportation form high costs for the cement industry, while labour runs in single digit rates. “If plants are not run at optimal capacity, production costs will go up. With the market not able to pay higher prices for the cement bags, players, which operate on thin margins, will be in a bind,” said Ghose. TCS, which saw a dip in its fourth quarter profit of fiscal 2020, sees margin contraction in the short term. It is looking at costs across the board, which includes slashing travel expenses and suspending salary increments. Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO of India’s largest IT services player TCS, expects the peak impact of the virus outbreak to reflect in the current quarter’s earnings and sees TCS’s financial performance returning to normalcy in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2546_News_1>The FMCG sector too has been impacted by the Covid-induced lockdown. Godrej Consumer Products MD & CEO Vivek Gambhir said, “Ensuring sufficient liquidity and a strong cash position is an important priority. Major capital expenditure decisions will get deferred by companies till there is more clarity in the evolving environment. Maintenance and capital expenditure for incremental capacity expansion and lines for new products launches will continue.”Although food is an essential commodity and there’s increased demand, factories are functional only partially as there are constraints on raw material, packaging and labour. Mother’s Recipe-Desai Foods executive director Sanjana Desai said, “We would need to revise our sales budgets and purchase forecasts for at least the next few months, as we expect the global recession to hit hard.”But largest biscuit-maker Parle Products plans to stick to its capacity addition plans this year. Executive director Arup Chauhan said, “We are currently in excess of 75% of our production levels with 50% worker strength. Production is ramping up every day. Stocks in the pipeline are moving really fast now and we believe, given that nutrition is going to be key for consumer health, we will increase our capacities by 20% this year.” Costs that companies will target could include fresh hiring, rentals, training & development budgets and salaries. Valuations in M&As (mergers & acquisition) may also decline. Executive Access India MD Ronesh Puri said, “Hiring will take a back seat and that will hit our industry. Some companies are struggling to pay salaries, and some are even thinking of vacating large rental places and shifting to smaller ones to save on costs. Salaries are either being staggered, or cut, or employees furloughed.” Chauhan of Parle Products, however, said, “Even if working capital is impacted, we are not cutting salaries or jobs. On the contrary, we are motivating our workers and employees and assuring them of benefits as well.”The impact on M&A activity would be mixed. Singhi Advisors MD Mahesh Singhi said, “Most companies will start re-assessing their business portfolios and de-leverage their balance sheets by selling off assets generating returns below certain threshold level. The increase in availability of assets will enable well-capitalised buyers to cherry pick these and structure transactions with staggered payouts and, in turn, lower risk-adjusted valuations.”Lower valuations will be expected by most strategic buyers since their own valuations would have dropped in the falling markets and risk perceptions would have changed. “We can expect increased PE-backed M&A transactions for companies building up capacities through acquisitions to meet increased traction and areas where global de-risking will be required where China has a monopolistic position,” said Singhi.According to Gambhir, this will be a good opportunity to scout opportunistically for M&A. “Companies that have strong balance sheets could find interesting companies to consolidate their presence in existing categories or enter new categories. Some of the smaller players could find the terrain more challenging over the next few quarters and may look to sell,” said Gambhir.Enhanced M&A activities will be seen in growth sectors like speciality chemicals, electronic manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare services and medical consumables. “We may also see need-based/compulsive deals in beaten down sectors like auto components, commodity packaging and metal processing. However, finding a buyer in such situations will be equally difficult,” said Singhi.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/companies-see-cash-as-king-cut-capex-plans/articleshow/75369753.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2546_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_2546_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-75369802,width-300,imgsize-293831,,resizemode-4,quality-100/money-.jpg"}, {"caption": "graph toi 25th apr", "id": "Economictime_PL_2546_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-75369948,quality-100/graph-toi-25th-apr.jpg"}]}

ITC may use own cash reserves to invest directly in startups that could give ITC entry into newer categories and business models, or provide digital or physical infrastructure.ITC already invests in alternative investment funds (AIFs), which, in turn, invest in startups.

The idea is to showcase its entire FMCG range under one roof, not to compete with traditional sales channels, Puri said. Consumers can, however, buy from these stores. The company will also expand its ecommerce store front, itcstore.in, to sell all FMCG products from August. At present, the website sells chocolates and coffee. It will start with deliveries to Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad initially. The company has tied up with ecommerce logistics partners for last-mile delivery. Its own ecommerce distributors will fulfill orders. “Eventually, we may even merge the ecommerce site for Classmate notebooks into this and will also launch an app for itcstore.in,” said Puri.ITC also plans to launch 40-50 FMCG products every year to achieve `1lakh crore in revenue from this business by 2030. It launched 50 FMCG products in 2018-19, its highest ever in a single fiscal. Puri said the company has launched 26 products this year. The industry has been facing a slowdown from the second half of last year, Puri said.ITC, however, is optimistic about long-term growth due to India’s low per capita consumption and demographics. “Some of the policy directives and reforms will also lead to higher consumption.

In the premium segment, OnePlus8 and Apple iPhone SE were launched globally last month and are expected to go on sale by the second half of May.Besides, Samsung has slashed the online price of its Galaxy M31 variants by Rs 500.<IMG Economictime_PL_2553_News_1>As per estimates, about 20 million smartphones were expected to be sold during April. “We believe 70-80% of this pent-up demand may play out in May and June,” said Shah.Faisal Kawoosa, chief analyst at TechArc, said the top five smartphone makers – Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Realme and Samsung – will try to reframe their launch calendars which were disturbed due to the 40-day lockdown.But overall demand isn’t expected to revive anytime soon.Leading mobile phone firm Xiaomi said last week that demand for smartphones will remain muted in the April-June quarter and a rebound is likely to take place in the second half of the calendar year.Market research firm IDC expects India’s mobile phone market to follow a U-shaped recovery from the third quarter onwards.“The pent-up demand from the first half of the year will gradually shift to the second half, rolling over to 2021 as well. A revival in consumer demand is expected around the festive quarter of 4Q20; with amplified marketing and promotional activities,” Navkendar Singh , research director, client devices and IPDS, IDC India said in a report.He said that with Covid-19 expected to hurt the overall market in 2020, mobile phone firms should support offline channels with hyperlocal delivery initiatives in key cities.To aid their offline retail partners, firms including Xiaomi and Vivo have also adopted the hybrid O2O (offline to online) model where customers can order a device from their nearest retailer via the firm’s official portal. Samsung, on the other hand, is offering home delivery of its finance service for customers to choose their lending option.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/smartphone-makers-resume-launches-eye-pent-up-demand/articleshow/75700923.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2553_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Market research firm IDC expects India’s mobile phone market to follow a U-shaped recovery from the third quarter onwards.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2553_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-75700924,width-650,imgsize-78265,,resizemode-4,quality-100/smartphone.jpg"}, {"caption": "Back to Business_Logo_300x316_Pixel", "id": "Economictime_PL_2553_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-75709568,quality-100/back-to-business_logo_300x316_pixel.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Parts running out, handset production in India could soon stop completely", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2568_News_0>New Delhi | Mumbai: Top smartphone makers in India have started to feel the pinch of the extended lockdown of component factories in China, with the likes of market leader Xiaomi expecting component prices to rise as supplies have started getting hit. Retailers say the stocks of Apple iPhone 11and 11Pro models, which are imported, are running out as the impact of the deadly coronavirus starts to hit home in the world’s second largest smartphone market.Industry players fear that local production of handsets may come to a complete halt starting next week in the absence of supplies from China. Analysts expect smartphone sales to fall 10-15% in the January-March quarter, but expect a sharper impact in the April-June period, and four to five week delays in new launches.“The extended shutdown in China is likely to have an impact on our supply chain and, there is a risk of impact on the overall quantum of component supplies,” a spokesperson for Xiaomi, India’s top smartphone maker, told ET. “While we are working to explore alternative supply channels for components and raw materials, the immediate impact is that the short supply might cause some negative pressure on the prices of these components,” the spokesperson added.India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told ET that the industry has started running out of stocks and if things don’t turn around by this weekend, then “there will be serious disruptions”.Industry officials say battery and some camera modules are made in Vietnam, while displays and connectors are majorly made in China. Chips are made in Taiwan but are sent to China for the final build-up. Feature phone sales are set to take a massive hit since the key printed circuit board (PCB) component is imported from China.“For February, sourcing of components and materials take place in December and January, while for March, sourcing was supposed to take place in mid-February, which is not happening. So, after the first two weeks of March, there will be a shortage of devices,” one of the officials said.But stocks of Apple’s iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are already running low, or are already out in some stores, said retailers.“We do not have iPhone 11 of 128 GB, a popular model. For the others, right now, we have handsets available but very few remain. There has been no new supply. We hope that the new supply will come next month,” said an employee at the Apple store in one of the largest malls of New Delhi.This supply crunch is not restricted to just one city. <IMG Economictime_PL_2568_News_1> “Most of the 11 pro series are not available and there is very limited stock of iPhone 11-64GB. We have returned customers who wanted the series in 128 GB,” said the manager of an Apple store in central Mumbai.He added that the stock crunch also included Apple Watches and Macbooks. “We were told it will take at least three weeks for new supply,” he added.In China, only some factories have got permission to open, even as the death toll from the deadly coronavirus outbreak crossed 1,000. A news agency reported that Taiwan’s Foxconn, the main manufacturer of iPhones, hopes to resume half of its production in China by February-end, and touch 80% of production in March.Apple didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.“If there is pressure on components, then there is an increase in production cost, and it can have an impact on the prices of certain products in India. At the same time, companies will delay new product launches since they won’t have supplies for production,” Tarun Pathak, associate di- rec- tor at Counterpoint Research, said.He expects a 10-12% decline in smartphone sales in Q1, while TechArc founder Faisal Kawoosa pegs the fall at 10-15%.“We expect new launches to be pushed back by at least 4-5 weeks and the ones which are being launched will have limited stock. And, we don’t expect factories to run on full capacity in February. If the virus is contained in March, it will still take two months for commercial activities to come back to normal in China,” Pathak added.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/parts-running-out-local-handset-output-may-stop/articleshow/74109307.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2568_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Top smartphone makers in India have started to feel the pinch of the extended lockdown of component factories in China, with the likes of market leader Xiaomi expecting component prices to rise as supplies have started getting hit.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2568_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74109317,width-650,imgsize-71248,,resizemode-4,quality-100/mobile-agencies.jpg"}, {"caption": "graph", "id": "Economictime_PL_2568_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74109327,quality-100/graph.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Airtel launches converged digital entertainment platform ahead of Jio's home broadband launch", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2599_News_0>NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel launched a digital entertainment services platform christened Airtel Xstream, three days before Reliance Jio Infocomm’s home broadband is set to go live, taking the rivalry between the two telecom operators to the next stage.The Sunil Mittal-led telco’s platform will allow customers to access diverse digital content on a screen of their choice – television, PC or smartphone – with a unified user interface.The content on Airtel Xstream will include live TV, videos, music, news and sports that can be viewed using an OTT (over the top) smart stick, an internet-enabled set-top box and handheld devices.Airtel’s offering is aimed at combatting Jio’s imminent home broadband blitz that analysts said could trigger another disruption, primarily in the urban digital TV and home broadband market.The telco unveiled two Android-based connected devices on Monday – an Xstream OTT stick and an Xstream 4K hybrid box – priced at Rs 3,999 each, that will make any TV a smart device. The hybrid box comes with a complimentary 1-year subscription worth Rs 999 to all Xstream content in addition to a month’s subscription to an HD direct to-home digital TV services pack.“Airtel Xstream is India’s first converged entertainment platform that will cater to needs of a new generation of consumers looking for seamless and converged entertainment across multiple screens at home and on-the-go,” Adarsh Nair, chief product officer at Bharti Airtel, said in a statement.ET reported in its August 22 edition that Airtel would bundle a customised Android-based set-top box to deliver digital entertainment and fast broadband services in September.Airtel’s entertainment service platform “is a strong counter-offer ahead of JioFiber’s launch,” signalling the telecom market is rapidly moving towards quad-play, bundling a mix of mobile, digital TV, fast broadband and landline services, said Rohan Dhamija, a partner at Analysys Mason.However, he was sceptical about the “actual impact and utility” of Airtel’s hardware because there are already “several hardware options in the market from the likes of Google and Amazon that can transform an ordinary TV into a smart one, coupled with apps in circulation from TataSky and Hotstar that customers can easily download to enjoy a television-like experience on their smartphone screens.”<IMG Economictime_PL_2599_News_1> An Airtel user of Netflix or Amazon Prime won’t be able to transfer the balance to the stick or the hybrid box. So, experts said this is “effectively over and above the fixed costs.”Mukesh Ambani-led Jio’s home broadband plans – which is likely to also provide access to apps such as Jio Cinema, Jio TV, Jio Cinema and music, besides gaming, video calling and virtual reality via its set-top box – will be priced between Rs 700 and Rs 10,000 a month.Brokerage Jefferies said the “key for JioFiber will be the pricing,” once the plans are commercially rolled out.Analysts said Jio’s promise of a free HD or 4K LED smart television along with a 4K set-top box to those opting for its yearly home broadband packs could be the game-changer and induce customer churn at urban-focussed TV distributors such as TataSky, Airtel Digital TV and Siti, especially with national cable TV players Hathway and Den Networks already in the Reliance fold.“Competition is busy doing what they are doing, but we are obsessed with our customers,” Airtel’s Nair told ET.Latest regulatory data pegs the national DTH user base at about 73 million, with Dish TV commanding a 40% market share, followed by Tata Sky (25%), Airtel Digital TV (22%) and Sun Direct (12%). Airtel is said to have been in talks to acquire Dish TV to beef up its DTH play.Jefferies said average revenue per user (ARPU) for broadband ranges from Rs 400 to Rs 1,000 a month, with 100 GB plans generating Rs 600 to Rs 1,000. Additionally, TV ARPUs are about Rs 200.Airtel’s home services ARPU grew 1.2% sequentially to Rs 825 in the quarter ended June, while its digital TV services ARPU fell almost 33% sequentially to Rs 157 in the first quarter.Airtel executives said that with the OTT stick, an ‘Airtel Thanks’ customer gains automatic access to digital content. Others need to buy a Rs 999 subscription to access such content, beyond the first 30-day free offer. Airtel Thanks is a rewards programme for select customers.In the case of DTH, subscription to content is automatic and existing Airtel digital TV customers can upgrade to Airtel Xstream box by paying a flat Rs 2,249.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/airtel-launches-converged-digital-entertainment-platform-ahead-of-jios-home-broadband-launch/articleshow/70945847.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2599_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Airtel Xstream is India’s first converged entertainment platform", "id": "Economictime_PL_2599_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70945862,width-300,imgsize-647710,,resizemode-4,quality-100/airtel-.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2599_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70953260,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Car makers rev up launches to get past rough patch", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2633_News_0>MUMBAI: Automakers in India have lined up more than three dozen product launches, including upgrades, for the next six to nine months, as they seek to revive sentiment in a market that is going through its worst phase amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Year 2020 was to see a large number of product upgrades because of new BS-VI emission standards. There were also 21 all-new vehicles lined up. The lockdown pushed the launches back, resulting in a packed schedule for the rest of the year — an average one launch a week.  Industry trackers predict a minimum 20% decline in automobile sales in India in 2020. “It’s a Catch-22 situation for carmakers right now,” said Gaurav Vangaal, an associate director at market research firm IHS Markit. Demand will be weak, but new models could change the mood and “carmakers are desperately hoping for this,” he said. New products are expected to have aggressive price tags and easy financing options to attract buyers. <IMG Economictime_PL_2633_News_1>An all-new small car is the most anticipated launch from Maruti Suzuki, while Hyundai Motor is set to bring in a new-generation elite i20.

{"title": "Consumer goods revival hopes dashed", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2651_News_0>KOLKATA | MUMBAI: Consumer goods market for essentials, groceries, household products, smartphones and electronics are seeing further moderation in growth, belying expectations of a revival during quarter ended March.The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) market grew 1% during January, a sharp fall from 2.4% the same month, a year ago according to a latest study by Kantar Worldpanel, a global consumer research firm owned by communications and advertising giant WPP. In fact, unlike previous quarters where slowdown was largely led by rural markets, latest data revealed that urban growth, at 0.2%, dragged down the entire segment even as hinterland consumption remained that same at 1.8%.Smartphone sales trackers have revised downward their sales estimates for the industry, while consumer electronics companies for the first time said sales would take a hit in both the current quarter as well as in April-June due to the coronavirus outbreak. The virus could also weigh on sales of FMCG, although it is too early to predict, say companies.“We will have to wait-and-see how the situation evolves. Things are too dynamic and uncertain at this stage to call out any trends. A lot will depend on how long this crisis lasts for. We will continue to focus on enhancing our distribution and launch affordable innovations to drive growth,” said Vivek Gambhir, managing director, Godrej Consumer Products. <IMG Economictime_PL_2651_News_1> Several states have scaled up precautionary measures to curb the spread — from closing public places, educational institutions, pubs and restaurants, cinema halls to shuttering malls till month-end. This, in turn, could hurt out-of-home and impulse consumption across categories, said Marico CEO Saugata Gupta. “All depends on how soon this thing dies down since there are possibilities of a long-term impact,” he added.Latest numbers obtained from industry officials quoting Nielsen, suggested that growth in several categories such as soaps, laundry, toothpaste, shampoo, skin creams and biscuits more than halved during January and February, compared to a year ago. (see graphic) Despite sales soaring since a week, especially for food items, due to panic buying, it will still be difficult to compensate for the tepid growth companies witnessed over the past two months.“The growth will surely improve but will not reach the levels that we had a year ago. Also, we have historically seen a lull after such massive rush to buy consumer staff and we have to brace for such anomaly,” said Mayank Shah, category head at Parle Products.Analysts have started to re-rate consumer stocks with lower sales guidance, too. Electronics and smartphone makers say the issue is more demand-driven now compared to problems on the supply side, which the companies faced during lockdown of China, when component availability was biggest concern.“Initially we thought smartphone sales will be better in March with the government increasing GST on smartphones by 6% which would come into effect from April. But smartphone purchase is no longer on top of the mind for consumers,” said Navkendar Singh, research director at International Data Corporation that estimates sales to be down by 5-10% in January to March Counterpoint Research too revised its shipment outlook from 10% decline earlier to 15% as compared to same period last year. The firm's senior analyst Karn Chauhan said if the COVID-19 situation remains critical, the smartphone market will be further impacted especially in the first two months of April-June quarter. In 2019, the smartphone market grew by 8%.For refrigerators, washing machines and air-conditioners, the industry is estimating similar deep impact on sales. The industry, which was expecting 12-15% growth in January to March quarter due to buoyant sales in first two months, now expects a flat quarter due to 15-20% decline in volume sales in March, said Kamal Nandi, president of industry body Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA). In 2019, sales growth was the best in four years at 9%.CEAMA is fearing similar degrowth in April, too, which alone contributes 15% of the industry’s annual sales.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/consumer-goods-revival-hopes-dashed/articleshow/74702192.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2651_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) market grew 1% during January.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2651_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74702226,width-300,imgsize-420768,,resizemode-4,quality-100/4.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_2651_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74702229,quality-100/2.jpg"}]}

One of the divisions would focus on premium bikes and international markets, while the other would handle mass-market motorcycles, scooters and mopeds.Arun Siddharth, who was vice-president for motorcycles, has now been made VP-marketing, premium two wheelers, international business and TVS Racing. Aniruddha Haldar, who was marketing vice-president for scooters and the corporate brand, has been given additional responsibility of mass-market motorcycles.The new structure was put in place a few months before the rollout of the new big bike. Developed in partnership with BMW, the 310 RR is a new flagship that may see multiple iterations in the future.<IMG Economictime_PL_2673_News_1> Siddharth said that TVS Motor is now not restricted to onesegment, with the addition of new models like the Apache RR 310.“The RR 310 is our halo bike. The higher priced sports bike segment is still very small but has a huge potential for growth. We have announced that we are planning to sell about 10,000 bikes in the first year since launch and the reception has been very strong so far,” added Siddharth.Already a leader in the moped segment and the second-largest player in scooters, TVS is steadily increasing its market share with Apache, which currently has a share of 38% in the 150-250 cc space.Apache is just behind Bajaj Pulsar in the segment. Against the segment growth of over 10%, TVS Motor has seen more than 20% growth in the last 3-4 years.Being a full-range player, TVS created Performance Zones across 52 outlets in the country in 40 cities. These zones are purposely being kept part of the same outlets, as the company expects RR 310 could have a positive ruboff on the other bikes.Unlike the past, TVS Motor adopted a completely digital and experiential marketing strategy against the traditional medium of marketing through newspapers and television.Siddharth says that since the customer base is fairly niche, the approach had to be different.

The new-generation global van, called T1N, will come in both diesel and electric avatars, and different seating configurations.<IMG Economictime_PL_2766_News_1> “Shared mobility is the key strand on which our future path has been defined,” managing director Prasan Firodia told ET. The next step is to ride on domestic leadership with a global play, he added.“This is the best time to be in the people transportation business. There is an increased emphasis from the Government of India to push public transportation with rising congestion … on the other hand, there are many new shared-mobility platforms springing up in India creating new demand. That, along with global markets with new gen products, we are looking at easily doubling or tripling our volumes,” Firodia said.With the T1N platform, Force Motors is seeking to create a new premium category in the people carrier space, as well as launch products that are benchmarked against some key international brands and meet the requirements in over a dozen markets of the Middle East, Africa, South Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.Close to half a million mid-size vans are sold globally with the likes of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Ford Transit and Renault Trafic leading the market. Force Motors has a limited presence globally with a 4-5% share. With the T1N and three derivatives expected on it, Firodia said the aspiration was to touch 10% of the global share.“There is a big gap between products offered by Mercedes-Benz, Ford or Renault in the global markets and the Chinese. Our endeavour is to bridge the sweet spot by offering premium products at an attractive price,” Firodia said.Force Motors had set up a dedicated team of 150 engineers for the global van project a few years ago. The company also went for domain experts: for design, it relied on an Italian design house, while for ride and handling, a UK firm was brought on board. Besides, Japanese and European engineering houses helped it in crash worthiness and a German firm in body engineering. This, Firodia said, was the biggest project delivered by the company in the last one decade.Locally, sales of the Tempo Traveller have grown thanks to increased acceptability in a wide range of operations, such as ambulance, school bus, feeder bus as well as app-based city transport.

{"title": "FMCG companies losing speed: Growth slows for third quarter", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2787_News_0>NEW DELHI: Growth in India's fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector is declining as lower spending in urban centres and slowdown in rural growth crimp consumption, according to market research firm Nielsen.The country’s largest market researcher on Wednesday said value growth in the FMCG space in the April-June quarter of 2019 dropped to 10% from a year ago. It was also the third consecutive quarter of slowdown. The Q2 growth numbers follow softening from the third quarter of last year when the sector registered 16.2% growth, it said.Revising its forecast for the year, Nielsen said FMCG growth for the first half of 2019 stands at 12% against its earlier prediction of 13-14%.“Based on an analysis of key factors, a revised forecast for the year-end of 2019 estimates all-India FMCG growth to be in the 9-10% range,” Sunil Khiani, Nielsen’s South Asia head of retail measurement services, said. Within this, the food category is expected to grow 10-11% while personal care and home care segments are expected to grow by 7% and 8%, respectively.Consumer facing companies said growth forecasts are lower than what they expected earlier. “Distributors generally operate on cash but during elections they were cautious to transact or carry higher amount of currency.This affected trade especially in smaller towns,” said B Krishna Rao, senior category head at Parle Products, which gets more than half of its sales from rural markets. “With good monsoon and a stable government, the situation may improve, but growth rate expectations are lower now than what we envisaged during the start of the year.\"According to Khiani, at the beginning of the year there was softening driven by essential and impulse food categories. “However, this quarter has witnessed a slowdown across all food as well as non-food categories, with salty snacks, biscuits, spices, soaps and packaged tea leading the slowdown,” he said.Nielsen cited four key factors impacting growth-—macroeconomic, government policies, monsoons and a low base effect.“There is a looming concern on increasing inflationary pressure, which was at 1.9% at the beginning of the year and has already moved up to 3.18% in June this year,” he said.Vivek Gambhir, MD, Godrej Consumer Products , had told ET last week that “over the last few quarters, FMCG in rural has grown ahead of urban. However, the pace of rural growth has been slower than historically, when rural was growing more than twice the growth of urban. Our hope is that the government’s efforts to revive the rural economy should lead to better rural growth in the second half of this fiscal year. To deal with the slowdown, we are focusing on driving volume growth through new product launches and consumer offers, as well as fast-tracking growth in alternate channels such as modern trade and e-commerce.”The Nielsen retail panel data outlines two key contributors to the overall slowdown in the FMCG sector—rural growth losing steam and fading advantage of small manufacturers.“The FMCG growth trend is dampened by volume-led growth, which has moved 3.6% points down from 9.9% in Q1’19 to 6.2% in the second quarter of the year,” it said.Rural India accounts for 37% of overall FMCG spends and has historically been growing at 3-5% points faster than urban on account of increasing affordability, availability and demand.However, rural growth is slowing down at double the rate of urban in recent quarters. This has brought rural growth closer to urban growth in Q2’19, according to Khiani.Nielsen also said the degree of decline in growth for small manufacturers post the goods & services tax (GST) implementation has resulted in an overall contribution of 50% to India’s slowdown story. <IMG Economictime_PL_2787_News_1> The market researcher said the slowdown is driven by the north and west zones, where growth has come down to single digits in Q2’19. Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Assam are leading the slowdown.It said the rural slowdown in these markets is reiterated in key macro-economic indicators including slowdown in rural output, reduced government spending, and untimely rain impacting crops in most North Indian markets.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/fmcg-companies-losing-speed-growth-slows-for-third-quarter/articleshow/70270548.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2787_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Rural India accounts for 37% of overall FMCG spends.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2787_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70270576,width-300,imgsize-44659,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2787_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70270520,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Consumption tale twist: Bharat lags India in June quarter", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2808_News_0>Growth in rural consumption was slightly slower than that in urban areas in the June quarter, the first time this has happened in over two years, due to liquidity issues and lower farm wage growth that impacted sentiment, said companies and analysts.Consumption in rural India, which accounts for about a third of the market, has been under stress over the past three quarters even though its rate of expansion has been faster than that in the cities. Rural growth rates, which were nearly double those in urban areas, moderated to 1.5 times in the December quarter and subsequently about 1.2 times in the March quarter.“Rural growth has further moderated and is now growing at the same level as its urban counterpart or slower due to the weak overall macroeconomic scenario including lower government spending, liquidity crisis hurting wholesalers, lower procurement despite MSP (minimum support price) hikes and limited beneficiaries of the PM KISAN scheme,” said Abneesh Roy, executive vice president, Edelweiss Securities.While market researchers Nielsen and Kantar Worldpanel (formerly IMRB) have not released data for the June quarter, numbers for the first two months of the period indicated visible rural stress. The rural market grew 3.3% in volume during April and May, compared with a 6.6% expansion in urban areas, according to Kantar data.Purchase Behaviour Linked to Farm OutputKantar Worldpanel is a global consumer research firm owned by communications and advertising giant WPP. This is the first instance of urban outpacing rural consumption in at least two years.In the last quarter of FY19, the fast-moving consumer goods market grew 13.6% with rural growth at 15.2% compared with 12.7% in the urban market. The overall market, however, further decelerated to 12.2% in April and 10.2% in May, said officials citing Nielsen data. <IMG Economictime_PL_2808_News_1> “There is a general slowdown in rural demand. While the demand has been slowing down sequentially from the October-December 2018 quarter, it is still higher year-on-year,” said Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer at Dabur, the maker of Vatika shampoo and Real juices, which derives 45% of its overall domestic sales from rural areas. “This slowdown, however, is not structural. For Dabur, rural growth is still 3-4% ahead of urban.”Sales of branded daily needs in the nation of 1.3 billion people have increasingly relied on the rural hinterland, home to more than 800 million, whose purchase behaviour is largely linked to farm output. The agriculture sector grew 2.9% in FY19, compared with 5% in FY18.“We see smaller regional companies growing well but larger firms with higher salience on the overall market has been dragging down the overall market,” said B Krishna Rao, senior category head at Parle Products that gets more than half its sales from rural markets. “Sentiment is not very optimistic and the situation is made worse because of the liquidity crunch, partly due to the election.” ICICI Securities met executives of 40 companies — 18 listed and 22 unlisted — across the consumer space to gauge the extent of the rural slowdown.“The conclusions were rural demand slowdown is likely to lead to growth deceleration in FY2020 and recovery will take time,” it said in an investor report. “Consumption deceleration continues across the board — urban consumer staples (are) outperforming rural.” The 40 companies ranged from large, listed, urban-focused ones to smaller regional players, it said.Companies, however, expect government efforts and a normal monsoon will revive the rural economy and should lead to better growth in the second half of the fiscal year. “The pace of rural growth has been slower than historically, when rural was growing more than twice the growth of urban,” said Vivek Gambhir, managing director, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. “To deal with the slowdown, we are focusing on driving volume growth through new product launches and consumer offers as well as fast-tracking growth in alternate channels such as modern trade and ecommerce.”", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/consumption-tale-twist-bharat-lags-india-in-june-quarter/articleshow/70136118.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2808_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In the last quarter of FY19, the fast-moving consumer goods market grew 13.6% with rural growth at 15.2% compared with 12.7% in the urban market.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2808_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70136135,width-300,imgsize-369316,,resizemode-4,quality-100/growth-fall-bccl.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2808_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70136120,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Price cap to take a toll on quality of premium hygiene products", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2817_News_0>MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Hygiene product makers said they will have to stop pushing premium value-added products and innovations within segments such as sanitary napkins, hand washes, disinfectants and adult diapers if the government puts a cap on their prices.A list of essential hygiene products is reportedly being finalised and these categories could come under price control. Companies say premium items that are costly to manufacture compared with basic versions are still being sold at lower margins unlike pharmaceutical companies that use similar technology and raw materials but have different pricing. Therefore, the analogy doesn’t hold for hygiene products, they argue.“For advertising spends, new launches and even innovation, we need profitability,” said a senior executive at a multinational consumer goods company. “The margin for us and trade is not very high since they are nascent categories and we are focussing on increasing usage by squeezing margins already. Also, it is still not clear whether all price points will be covered.”Companies say using cheaper raw materials to maintain pricing will translate into lower-quality products. In India, the sanitary napkin segment is controlled largely by three firms — Procter & Gamble, Unicharm and Johnson & Johnson. RB, which owns Dettol, has a significant chunk of the hygiene and liquid antiseptic market.“If price regulation is notified as a blanket cap, RB could be one of the most impacted and lose its pricing power, since Dettol is their biggest brand in India,” said a senior executive associated closely with the multinational. <IMG Economictime_PL_2817_News_1> Marketing Strategy May be Hit TooThe proposal comes months after RB introduced a high-margin, chemicals-free range of soaps and handwashes under the Dettol flagship brand, about 10-20% more expensive than the base brand. The India arm of the UK healthcare and consumer products maker rolled out the range in June.India is a top-five market for Dettol and has over 10% value share in bar soaps; in the smaller, handwash category it has 45-50% share. “Price regulation could impact marketing strategy too, since RB is a top advertiser,” said the person cited above. “Dettol has also been the face of the company’s Rs 100-crore Banega Swachh India campaign for five years now.”P&G declined to comment. RB, Hindustan Unilever and ITC didn’t respond to queries. HUL sells Lifebuoy, while ITC sells Savlon, which has a small presence in the segment.While the government is revisiting the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) to make relevant additions and omissions, it’s also preparing separate lists for medical devices, disposables and hygiene products.The Times of India reported on August 25. It currently regulates prices of about 384 essential medicines, including medical devices such as stents, by imposing a cap on their maximum retail price. Drugs companies are allowed to raise prices by up to 10% annually for their products. There is also a cap of 30% on trade margins for 42 cancer drugs.“Prices of adult diapers or feminine hygiene in India are among the lowest in the world. And there is no question of making super-profit in an open market. However, we feel the government must be referring to products and prices that consumers have to pay at institutions and hospitals, where such products can be classified as essentials,” said Kamal Johari, founder of Nobel Hygiene, which is a leader in the adult diaper category with their brand, Friends. “Patients end up paying more due to monopoly of these hospitals which dictate prices by marking them up several times over retail prices.”Lower prices typically lead to a rise in sales but not necessarily in discretionary segments. About six years ago, the government included condoms in the list of essential medicines and fixed their ceiling price in the Drug Pricing Control Order (DPCO). This in turn led to sales of the contraceptive declining a year ago for the first time as companies lowered marketing spends and halted innovations.In 2017, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), an expert committee set up by India’s drug pricing regulator, decided that prices for prophylactics will be fixed in two broad categories--ordinary condoms and those with special features.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/price-cap-to-take-a-toll-on-quality-of-premium-hygiene-products/articleshow/70834704.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2817_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A list of essential hygiene products is reportedly being finalised and these categories could come under price control.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2817_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70834722,width-300,imgsize-98620,,resizemode-4,quality-100/handwash.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_2817_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70834729,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}

In December last year, Google had launched 'Shopping' in India to allow users to easily filter through offers, review prices from multiple retailers and find products to shop.  \"We've witnessed incredible momentum since launch of Google shopping last year. Indian shoppers engage with our shopping experience more often, and for longer periods of time compared to other markets,\" Google Shopping Vice President - Product Management Surojit Chatterjee told .  He added that there are now over 200 million offers available on Google Shopping.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2844_News_1>  \"We have seen a strong traction, especially for small and medium businesses... clicks on listings that direct to small and medium business websites have increased by 30 percent,\" Chatterjee said.  He added that the company is now introducing new tools to help businesses connect with shoppers easily.  Through Google My Business (GMB), any local retailer can create an online store and connect with millions of shoppers searching for products online. Going forward, when these retailers post photos of their in-store products, they will automatically be surfaced as product listings on Search and in the Google shopping tab.  \"By way of this launch, Google is bringing 20,000 local businesses that are already on GMB into the shopping experience...

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday kept its key lending rate unchanged and sharply lowered its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast to 5% from 6.1%, while maintaining an \"accommodative\" policy stance.India's economy grew 6.8% in FY19. But economic expansion slowed to 4.5% in July-September, the weakest pace in more than six years, from 5% in the June quarter.“However, this slower pace of growth underlines the need to fully implement existing reforms and continue lowering barriers to trade to generate the investment and jobs India needs to raise living standards across the country,\" said OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.The OECD report noted that India has greatly expanded its participation in global trade in recent years but private investment remains relatively weak, employment rate has declined amid a shortage of quality jobs, rural incomes are stagnating, and per capita income varies considerably across states.“Further reforms to modernise the economy are now needed to drive the creation of high-quality jobs, as well as measures to improve public services and welfare,” it said.<IMG Economictime_PL_2875_News_1> Speaking at the launch of the report, chief economic adviser to the government Krishnamurthy Subramanian said global economic growth is significantly low, which is having an impact on India as well.“The global economy today is at one of its significantly low points... the current lull is particularly exasperated by a consistent attempt to downgrade the power of multilateralism,” he said.As per the report, restoring growth to the higher levels needed to provide ample jobs and ease inequality will require accelerating the pace of structural reforms to revive investment and exports. Macro Policies Monetary policy should remain accommodative as long as inflation is set to remain comfortably close to the target, the survey said. It called for India to “improve transparency” in off-budget transactions and its contingent liabilities as the government deficit-to-GDP ratio has declined but public spending programmes are being financed off the budget.“Establishing a fiscal council would help monitor progress toward fiscal targets and bring transparency,” the Paris-based organisation said. This comes after the government included extra budgetary resources, comprising fully-serviced government bonds, in the budget estimates for 2019-20.India’s public debt-to-GDP ratio remains relatively high, the survey said. Although the central government deficit and state deficits have declined, off-budget financing has increased, it said.Services Trade, Labour Laws Reducing restrictions to services trade imposed by trading partners and by India on imports would further boost trade in services, also giving a lift to manufacturing and the general economy.The OECD estimates suggest India would be the biggest beneficiary of a multilateral cut in services trade restrictions. Even without a multilateral agreement, moving alone to overhaul regulations would have a positive impact.Doing more to simplify complex labour laws – many of which discourage hiring by becoming binding as firms grow above stated thresholds – would help raise the share of quality jobs demanded by a fastgrowing and well-educated youth population in a country where the vast majority of employment is informal.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/more-reforms-needed-to-boost-jobs-incomes-oecd/articleshow/72392704.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2875_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_2875_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-72392709,width-300,imgsize-382574,,resizemode-4,quality-100/graph-random-getty.jpg"}, {"caption": "6th dec graph 2", "id": "Economictime_PL_2875_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-72392747,quality-100/6th-dec-graph-2.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Harsh Mariwala talks product failure, importance of going to marketplace; shares success story behind Saffola oats", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2926_News_0>Good ideas often fall flat in the marketplace. “Market research can only get you so far when it comes to launching a new product. You have to go to the marketplace to see whether what you are offering is working in the real world,” said Harsh Mariwala, Chairman, Marico Limited, at an event in Mumbai. A product might have all the right ingredients, but the cost of innovation is often failure. Big businesses might be able to stomach the loss. The death of a new product, however, could pose an existential threat to smaller rivals. Good businessmen, Mariwala reckons, have the necessary nous to shape consumer behaviour without burning their fingers by investing in half-baked ideas. “Whether it is the name, formulation, pricing, or packaging, every aspect of the merchandising plays a role in the eventual success or failure of the product. What happens in the prototype phase is that instead of going to the market research, you are testing your hypothesis among a group of people. For that, you should be willing to change things in order to innovate,” he said. Even established companies like Marico are not immune to the odd miscalculation. “Around five years back, we thought that there would be demand for baked snacks. All the snacks in the market at that time were fried. I, personally, was backing that product internally,” recounts Mariwala. The top management thought it wise to leverage the Saffola brand’s appeal with health-conscious consumers for the pilot project.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2926_News_1> “We have Saffola, which is good for the heart. So we thought, why not offer a baked snack under the Saffola brand? We went ahead and launched it in Bombay,” he said. Prototypes are rarely backed by advertising campaigns, and are hence reliant on positive feedback from consumers. Despite the brand’s street cred with “health-food” eaters, sales figures were anaemic. “The product didn’t do well because in our minds, Saffola was associated with health. Hence we gave more emphasis to the health part and not so much about the taste. It was a very healthy snack but perhaps not that tasty. Consumers in that segment want something tasty to munch on,” Mariwala conceded. Not one to be dissuaded by this failure, he took aim at another segment that was underserved in terms of options. “We saw an opportunity in the breakfast cereal business around three years back. Indians like a savoury breakfast instead of a sweet breakfast. So if you look at oats, people mix it with milk, and add a little sugar and perhaps, nuts. We thought: can we offer savoury oats that do not compromise on taste?” Market research was conducted, and the taste bud of the average Indian, mapped.“Some people like spicy food, others less so. So for each taste palate, we had different formulations for our oats. And we are talking about an extremely clear cut marketplace. We’ve been able to take on the likes of Kellogg’s and Quaker and because of our innovation; our market share went up even though we didn’t have a presence until then. We are not the market leader by any means, but we have established a niche,” Mariwala said. “The key learning for us was that in the marketplace, you have to give consumers what they want.”", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/harsh-mariwala-talks-product-failure-importance-of-going-to-marketplace-shares-success-story-behind-saffola-oats/articleshow/74414681.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2926_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The Marico boss spoke candidly about product failures.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2926_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74415174,width-650,imgsize-1038223,,resizemode-4,quality-100/the-marico-boss-spoke-candidly-about-product-failures-.jpg"}, {"caption": "“The key learning for us was that in the marketplace, you have to give consumers what they want\", said Mariwala.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2926_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74415201,quality-100/the-key-learning-for-us-was-that-in-the-marketplace-you-have-to-give-consumers-what-they-want-said-mariwala-.jpg"}]}

Forty-seven year-old Gupta’s company Nirvana Being sells a range of products to meet the Indian consumer’s growing need to combat air pollution — from air purifiers to masks to “air bags”. It has also made `12-15 crore in annual revenue in the process. “While the air quality is hazardous in several Indian cities throughout the year, it is between mid-October and mid-March that we see peak traffic on the site,” says Gupta. “Owing to the bursting of firecrackers and burning of crop stubble, the level of toxicity in the air shoots up. Consequently, people, especially in Delhi-NCR, are concerned about air pollution at this time of the year,” says Shashi Ranjan, scientist and cofounder of healthcare solutions company PerSapien Innovations. Two years ago, it launched nasal filters under the brand name Airlens. He claims to have sold lakhs of nasal filters across the country. Over the last two-three years, Amazon India has seen a sharp rise in the demand for products in anti-pollution category — air purifiers, masks, humidifiers — from different parts of the country.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2940_News_1> “As per our search data trends, we have seen a 70-140% increase this year over the last two years combined in searches for air-purification options like masks, air purifiers or plants,” says Shalini Puchalapalli, director, category management, Amazon India. “We have seen a significant rise in the growth of air-pollution masks and are looking to serve 5x the number of customers this year over the last two years combined,” she adds. The growing numbers have prompted another ecommerce player, Snapdeal, to organise “special pollution stores” online where users can find all anti-pollution products in a curated collection, says a company spokesperson. During winter, Snapdeal gets several orders for pollution masks with neck warmers from north India. Air-quality sensors, air purifiers for home and car, and seeds of indoor plants are other popular items in the category.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2940_News_2> That’s not all. Anti-pollution items have permeated the beauty category too. A basic search for “anti-pollution” on beauty portal Nykaa throws over 400 product results across 100-odd brands. Six months ago, Nykaa’s beauty vertical, Nykaa Cosmetics, launched an anti-pollution foundation in 15 different shades to suit different skin tones. The company claims the product contains biosaccharide gum-4, a plant extract, that prevents skin damage from dust, micro particles and UV rays. “It is now 30% of our entire foundation business,” says Reena Chhabra, CEO of Nykaa’s private label arm FSN Brands. Brands like Pond’s, Vaseline, Colorbar, and Faces Canada have introduced a range of anti-pollution creams & face washes over the last couple of years. While many homegrown companies fret about the seasonal demand for antipollution products, they claim the popularity isn’t limited to Delhi-NCR. The region does comprise 70% sales in the category at Snapdeal, but this year it is “already witnessing an increase in search and purchase from various cities in north India, including Chandigarh, Ambala, Amritsar, Meerut and Kanpur”, says its spokesperson. One-tenth of Airlens’ orders come from Chennai, Bengaluru, Indore and Pune, says Ranjan. Even Nirvana Being receives 10% of its sales from Mumbai, Pune, Goa and the Northeast. Gupta has seen a 40-60% year-on-year growth in overall revenue from consumer sales over the last three years. Ranjan’s Airlens saw a 200% hike in sales between 2017 and ’18. He has sold over 50,000 filters this year.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2940_News_3> “When it comes to air pollution, we have gone from mitigation to adaptation. Dealing with it is part of our lives. Now we are designing our lifestyle accordingly,” says Shrey Goyal, a social entrepreneur who shuttles between Paris and Delhi for work and uses air purifiers at home and nasal filters outdoors. Anti-pollution accessories are a worldwide phenomenon now, he says. People in China, Japan and Korea wear masks in daily lives. Cyclists in London’s rush hour wear them like one would wear a helmet. “Back home in Delhi, I have seen women wearing patterned masks,” says Goyal.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2940_News_4> It points to another aspect of this trend — the glamourisation of anti-pollution products. A couple of years ago, Nirvana Being collaborated with fashion designer Manish Arora to launch a range of masks. Gupta says, “There’s a stigma around wearing masks. We try to combine fashion and function to remove that stigma. People buy masks in several designs to match their outfits.” Nirvana Being is the regional distributor of Vogmask, a US-based brand popular for its “stylish filtering respirators”. “We run design contests for fashion students. Selected designs get money & recognition from Vogmask,” says Gupta. Four new designs have been launched in India ahead of Diwali, he adds.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2940_News_5> Airlens’ nasal filters are also designed with fashion-conscious users in mind. “Unlike masks, nasal filters don’t cover three-fourths of your face but fit inside your nostrils so they are barely visible. Plus, they allow you to talk and eat with ease,” says Ranjan. During research for Airlens, he found that the human nose has a complicated structure. “After studying a great deal, we came up with two sizes of filters that could work for 70-80% of Indian noses.” Even then, last year, Suneel Ranaut, a user who made a verified purchase of Airlens on Amazon, posted a picture of the nasal purifiers he had received and wrote: “Colour should be brown it is black (sic).” It also means that when you mix fashion with functionality, you have to be sensitive to a range of your customers’ concerns, including skin tones.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/demand-for-anti-pollution-products-hike-during-festive-season/articleshow/71556781.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2940_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_2940_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-71556866,width-300,imgsize-727287,,resizemode-4,quality-100/mask-sunday-et.jpg"}, {"caption": "MASK 6 SUNDAY ET", "id": "Economictime_PL_2940_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-71557073,quality-100/mask-6-sunday-et.jpg"}, {"caption": "MASK 5 SUNDAY ET", "id": "Economictime_PL_2940_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-71557074,quality-100/mask-5-sunday-et.jpg"}, {"caption": "MASK 4 SUNDAY ET", "id": "Economictime_PL_2940_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-71557084,quality-100/mask-4-sunday-et.jpg"}, {"caption": "MASK 3 SUNDAY ET", "id": "Economictime_PL_2940_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-71557085,quality-100/mask-3-sunday-et.jpg"}, {"caption": "mask 2 sunday et", "id": "Economictime_PL_2940_News_5", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-71557086,quality-100/mask-2-sunday-et.jpg"}]}
{"title": "SaaS startup Clumio taps into Indian talent, launches R&D center in Bengaluru", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_2941_News_0>BENGALURU: SaaS-powered firm Clumio on Thursday announced the launch of the Clumio Research and Development Center in Bengaluru. Founded in 2017 in Santa Clara, California by Poojan Kumar, Kaustubh Patil and Woon Jung, Clumio provides a secure backup as a service for enterprises that reduces the cost and replaces the complexity of managing data across all clouds with a SaaS-powered approach. The firm aims to build and deliver SaaS-based data protection services on its platform built on AWS in its R&D center. The firm is hiring to fill roles across Software Engineering, Cloud Operations and Customer Support and Success. It is also creating a strong base in India already having 34 employees and planning to expand to more than 70 by the end of 2020.“A lot of companies, including multi-billionaire companies, take years to enter India. However, Clumio is a young startup and we started our operations in India very early. We are eager to tap into the great talent that is available in India. The India center will have its own charter and will play a big part in innovation to build cloud solutions,” Poojan Kumar, CEO and co-founder, Clumio, told ET Digital. The firm’s other R&D center is present in San Jose and the India center will also act as support for the global team. The engineering teams will play an integral part in product development and building best-in-class technology solutions. Some of the solutions developed by Clumio Research and Development Center with the support of its India team includes the recent addition of Microsoft 365 to its secure backup as a service. The team also built the REST API platform for Clumio. When asked if Covid-19 was an opportunistic timing to announce the opening of R&D operations in India since people are now understanding the importance of cloud computing and data backup, Kumar said the movement to cloud will only accelerate from here.  <IMG Economictime_PL_2941_News_1>“Every CIO that we talked to is basically saying that what they were going to achieve in the next 10 years, they now want to achieve in the next five. COVID-19 is going to make it harder for enterprises to do things themselves. It's hard to expect people to touch stuff and be present physically and people no longer want to put anything in the physical data centers. Companies want to leverage the cloud because it's all seamless and touchless,” he said. He added that automation is the key here and companies are realising that cloud services and cloud providers are available to get the job done without requiring as much manpower. Sandeep Soni, GM and Vice President of Engineering, India operations, gave his two cents on India’s position in the adoption of cloud services. “We are somewhere in the beginner and the intermediate stage. As far as adopting cloud technology is concerned, I think the US market is a little ahead, but we are getting there. Because a lot of cloud-based offerings and subscription models are being popped up in the media for people to consume and people are becoming more and more open to adopting,” he said. He added that every major cloud provider from AWS to Azure to GCP has a planned region or a planned expansion in India which indicates that there is a healthy demand for cloud services in the country.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/saas-startup-clumio-taps-into-indian-talent-launches-rd-center-in-bengaluru/articleshow/76061174.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_2941_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The team also built the REST API platform for Clumio.", "id": "Economictime_PL_2941_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76061447,width-300,imgsize-151457,,resizemode-4,quality-100/saas-startups.jpg"}, {"caption": "PoojanKumar-Sandeep-Soni", "id": "Economictime_PL_2941_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-76061573,quality-100/poojankumar-sandeep-soni.jpg"}]}
{"title": "ET Awards 2019: The superlative C-suite decides winners of ET Awards for Corporate Excellence", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_0>The first order of business as the nine-member jury for The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2019 met went through without any debate. Infosys non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani was unanimously selected jury chairman. Then, the debate started.The 2019 jury, as with every ET Awards jury, was a group of big achievers — put a group like this together and you’re guaranteed crackling conversation.Ask them to pick the best and brightest of India Inc, and you’re guaranteed fascinating and insightful debate.Ethics were top priority. It’s not just that Bhavish Aggarwal left the jury room when members were deliberating on the Business Leader of the Year award — he was a contender. Some jury members volunteered to recuse themselves because they were acquainted with nominees in various categories. Chairman Nilekani was firm, though, saying he had full faith in the integrity of the jury, and unless a jury member was directly related or was a nominee her/himself, he didn’t see any reason for a recusal. He was firmly supported by Mittal.Vigorous debates started right from the first award, Business Leader. Who’s more of a leader — a professional CEO or an entrepreneur?Nilekani, who has been both, presided over a debate that saw Sadhguru, Mittal, Morparia, Munjal and Shroff make strong cases, often disagreeing with each other.Every award was a two-step decision. The first round of voting pared the nominee list down to two, the second round chose the winner. All voting was by secret ballot and all results were announced by the chairman. For every category, jury members used their own wisdom, listened to each other, looked at detailed company numbers provided to them by the ET Intelligence Group and asked dozens of sharp questions. Deciding the winner for some categories took longer than others.When picking the Business Reformer, the jury had a long and fascinating debate on how to assess a public administrator’s contribution to easing conditions of entrepreneurship. Discussion went beyond choosing the winner, to fundamental aspects of the relationship between the state and business.Entrepreneur and Global Indian of the Year were two more categories that saw particularly high-spirited debates. Is entrepreneurship getting equated with a cash burn, valuation-chasing game, asked more than a few jury members. But what’s entrepreneurship without risk-taking, asked others. Are we biased in favour of B2C companies, was another sharp question.Deliberations on the Global Indian category showed the close understanding many jurists had of global business across sectors.How ‘Indian’ are global Indians, was another fascinating subplot.The issue here was to fairly assess whether success in the West can coexist happily with joyful expressions of Indian identity.And when the jury was choosing Businesswoman of the Year, the debate looked too close to call till the last minute. ET reinstated this category in 2019, and the high quality jury debate that preceded the vote on the winner showed why it is so necessary to champion India Inc’s smartest women.When Nilekani announced the winner of the last category and thanked the jury for a spirited and thoroughly fair debate, more than two hours had passed since they assembled. Two hours during which some of the best in business picked the best in business this year – and the bonus was a thoroughly interesting discussion.Friend, philosopher, FM: A special award for Arun Jaitley <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_1> A skilful parliamentarian who was respected on both sides of the aisle, former finance minister, past winner of the ET Awards, and a towering presence at the award ceremonies, Arun Jaitley, the jury all agreed, will be missed by all. The jury for The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2019 unanimously voted to institute a Special Award in order to recognise Arun Jaitley’s enormous contribution to public service, especially his role in championing economic reforms. Not only was Jaitley a central figure in building consensus over the goods and services tax, but even the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code came into being under his watch.Business Leader: Charting a different path to the top spot <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_2> Nearly six years ago, Sanjiv Mehta became the first Indian chief executive at Hindustan Unilever who had never worked at the country’s biggest consumer goods company earlier. That was not the only departure from the tried-and-tested CEO template of HUL, the gold standard in consumer marketing in India. Unlike his recent predecessors who had cut their teeth and built their reputation in the rough-and-tough of marketing, 58-year old Mehta is a chartered accountant who transited to a broader profile.The unprecedented move didn’t fail HUL. Its market capitalisation nearly trebled to Rs 4.35 lakh crore since Mehta joined the firm in September 2013 as it added about Rs 3 lakh crore in value — more than the combined market cap of rivals Colgate, Dabur, Marico and Godrej Consumer Products. Mehta also oversaw the Indian business outpace Brazil to become the second largest market behind the US in terms of sales for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever.Mehta credits various initiatives for HUL’s impressive growth in a tough and highly competitive market. “We have been creating a future-fit portfolio through extensive market development and strategic acquisitions; rebalancing scale and driving focus through initiatives like ‘Winning in many Indias’ (WIMI); making our organisation nimble by setting up country-category business teams to empower people to experiment; and leading digital transformation across our value chain to build new capabilities that will fundamentally reshape the way we do business,” he said.Under WIMI strategy, the maker of Rin and Dove reorganised its go-to-market operations from the traditional four sales branches to 14 consumer clusters. HUL also added a fifth branch in central India to accelerate sales in a relatively underpenetrated but high-growth market. This, in turn, helped counter regional competition and improved market share.Born to SP Mehta, an RBI employee, Mehta has been with Unilever for 26 years.He worked in about 20 countries in three different regions — South Asia, South East Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa — before his India stint.But when Mehta took over HUL — which is among the most important units for Unilever, accounting for nearly 9% of its overall sales — in 2013, the situation wasn’t normal. The overall fast-moving consumer market had gone into what can be described as a lull period, after recording 17-18% growth in the preceding years. The growth rate more than halved to 6-7% between 2013 and 2016. India’s consumer goods sector saw a series of disruptions, from two consecutive bad monsoons to demonetisation woes and short-term trade issues after the introduction of GST.But, in his six years at the helm, Mehta helped increase HUL’s sales from Rs 25,810 crore in 2013 to Rs 38,224 crore now. That’s over Rs 12,000 crore in incremental sales, or more than the size of Nestlé or P&G’s overall business in India. Last fiscal, HUL posted Rs 8,500 crore of Ebitda, with margins at its highest ever at 22.9%. Mehta was appointed president of South Asia and a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) in March this year.Lifetime Achievement: DMRC’s hero is a Metro Man to the core <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_3> He’s the most “revolutionary disruptor in urban transport,” said a member of the jury at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence, which conferred the Lifetime Achievement award on E Sreedharan, popularly known as Metro Man. He is “one of the most amazing builders of modern India” in terms of values as well as infrastructure, said another member of the jury.“I am very happy and elated for this recognition,” Sreedharan told ET.Government departments are known for missing project completion deadlines. No major infrastructure project has been completed in India without delays and cost overruns.But under Sreedharan, the Delhi Metro — independent India’s most ambitious transportation project — became operational before its completion deadline.Maverick civil engineer Sreedharan went on to repeat the feat, delivering project after project months before official deadlines, saving the exchequer thousands of crores in cost overruns.Armed with a free hand from the government, Sreedharan ensured that the Delhi Metro progressed at great speed along with transparency in awarding contracts. In just two years and nine months, the first phase of the Delhi Metro was completed, three months earlier than originally scheduled.The project’s 124 km second phase, estimated to cost Rs 24,000 crore, took only four-and-ahalf years to be commissioned.The 85-year-old veteran, who is from the Indian Railways Engineering Service, has spent almost 60 years building railway lines, bridges and metro networks, and has delivered some of country’s most critical infrastructure projects such as the Konkan Rail, Kolkata Metro and Delhi Metro.In the 1970s, Sreedharan was entrusted with designing India’s first metro network in Kolkata. Then came the Konkan Rail project, an engineer’s nightmare in terms of construction. The project ran between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats from Mangalore to Roha in Maharashtra.He had joined the railways as an assistant engineer in 1954 and retired from it after 36 years of service in 1990.After spending seven years at Konkan Rail Corp, he became managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corp in 1997. Sreedharan retired from Delhi Metro in December 2011 at the age of 79 and moved back to Kerala. He was then approached by many state governments to help implement metro projects.Sreedharan helped deliver projects with a total investment of about Rs 10 lakh crore, according to ‘Karmayogi: A biography of E Sreedharan’. From the Pamban Bridge to the Kochi Metro, none of the projects executed by him were touched by even a hint of corruption.Indeed, this was something the jury recognised. Sreedharan is currently heading a central government committee to fix technical standards for all upcoming metro networks. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_4>  <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_5> Businesswoman: A beautiful business model   Nykaa has emerged as one of the most recognisable consumer brands in the fast-growing online beauty category without raising billions of dollars in investor capital. This has been one of the standout differentiators for Nykaa’s founder Falguni Nayar.Credited with building an ecommerce platform very differently from the rest the industry, Nayar has won the coveted Business Woman of the Year Award. Nayar’s ability to steer clear of heavy discounting and massive funding to spur growth in a typically cash guzzling industry has helped her uniquely position Nykaa amid competitors.“I have always believed this (ET Awards for Corporate Excellence) is one of the most coveted awards since the time I started working in Mumbai. I have always looked up to the people who have won this award previously. You have to pinch yourself to believe you are in the same room as some of the previous winners,” Nayar told ET after winning.A former investment banker at Kotak Mahindra Capital where she was the managing director, Nayar founded Nykaa in 2012. “I am so glad that I jumped into entrepreneurship. I believed in technology and I believed in the Indian consumer. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_6> The way it is panning out, the sky’s the limit,” said Nayar.Nayar’s 180-degree shift from being a career banking professional to striking out on her own with a consumer-focused startup was one of the key reasons the jury picked her.In the past seven years, the online retailer has expanded into offline stores, launched new categories like fashion and continued to grow amid competition from bigger ecommerce players like Amazon and Flipkart’s Myntra. Nykaa doubled net revenue to Rs 1,230 crore in the previous fiscal, pushing aggressively into newly-launched categories such as apparel and fashion. Its valuation, too, has kept pace with growth.Apart from Nykaa Fashion, it has also set up Nykaa Man to build its men’s grooming business, and introduced Nykaa Pro, a portal for professional beauty consumers, with an aim to diversify its business. The company will focus on building heft in its fashion and apparel categories, and grow offline stores to 70 by March next year, from 35 currently, Nayar told ET in an interview earlier this year.Nykaa began by curating beauty products and embellishing it with edgy content, including reviews and expert recommendations customers could use to make informed decisions about beauty needs. Since then, however, Nykaa has done what none of the big ecommerce companies have been able to do in the beauty space. Its inhouse eponymous brand, which contributes 10% to overall sales, has been an important lever of growth.Nykaa will start distributing products more aggressively and widely across third-party offline stores to scale up this year, Nayar told ET in April. Nayar will have to position her fashion and apparel offering in such a way that it is not only focused on selection and price, but also build stickiness and engagement like it did in the core beauty category.Global Indian: A ten-fold growth in market cap: Priceless   When Ajay Banga took over as the president and chief executive at Mastercard in July 2010, he followed a list of illustrious Indians who have made it to the top of multinational companies after the 2008 economic crisis, such as Vikram Pandit of Citibank, Deven Sharma at Standard & Poor’s and Piyush Gupta of Singapore-based DBS Group.Banga’s stint as CEO has resulted in a profitable decade for the shareholders of the payment company. Since Banga took over in July 2010, Mastercard’s net income has increased four times to $2 billion for the quarter through June 2019 from $458 million in 2010. The rise in income has also resulted in better returns for shareholders as shares have risen 10-fold in that period, to $269 at close in New York last week. Its market capitalisation is $270 billion.Under Banga, Mastercard has diversified revenue away from consumer credit cards towards the more predictable commercial payments and debit and prepaid cards, and added new streams of services such as data analytics, consulting and loyalty platforms. Data on the company’s website shows that of the $5.9 trillion gross dollar volumes reported in 2018, 11% came from commercial businesses — up from 9% in 2012 — and 46% from debit and prepaid cards which contributed 41% in 2012.Banga has spoken out against cryptocurrencies, calling them junk. “The idea of an anonymised currency produced by people who have to mine it, the value of which can fluctuate wildly — that to me is not the way that any medium of exchange deserves to be considered as a medium of exchange,” Banga said last year.An economics graduate from Delhi University, Banga’s entire career has been at multinational companies. He began with Nestlé in India after doing his management from IIM Ahmedabad.At Nestlé, Banga spent 13 years across sales, marketing and management.He also worked at PepsiCo at a time when the Indian economy was just starting to enjoy the fruits of liberalisation.Banga’s first job in the financial sector was with Citibank, which he joined in 1996 and rose to head the US-based lender’s unit in Asia Pacific.He joined Mastercard in 2009 as president and chief operating officer, before being named the CEO of the payments giant.Banga, who got the Padma Shri in 2016, was earlier this year awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Now, as The Economic Times Global Indian of the Year, the 59-year old joins an elite company comprising global business leaders like Adobe Systems chief executive Shantanu Narayen (2018) and Fairfax chief executive Prem Watsa (2017).Banga was modesty personified when he spoke to ET, giving credit to his colleagues and partners for the success he has enjoyed throughout his career. “It’s an incredible honour to receive this recognition. It is a testament to what we can accomplish when we combine a culture of decency with a solid business strategy that includes actions to solve societal issues. But you know, they say it takes a village; in my case I am very fortunate to have terrific employees and partners who inspire, cajole, guide and assist me every day,” Banga said.As one of the captains of American industry, Banga has called for a ‘mahagatbandhan’ between the two largest democracies of the world, India and the US.“What I want to really see is a time in the world when the two greatest democracies are engaging at every level — socially, culturally, politically and economically,” Banga said at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum earlier this year.Company: An NBFC with a difference   BAJAJ FINANCEYou don’t need to be a bank to build a financial services supermarket, as visualised by Sandy Weill of Citigroup and by KV Kamath in India. You can do it by being a non-banking finance company (NBFC) as well.Bajaj Finance, started as a result of the demerger of Bajaj Auto over a decade ago, has become the largest technology-driven retail franchise in the NBFC space, with a market capitalisation of Rs 2.35 lakh crore. Defying market challenges, Bajaj Finance has continued to showcase strong sequential growth over the past year, while several others floundered. Growth has come on the back of use of analytics, cross-selling and a large retail ecosystem.What started as a captive two-wheeler financier of Bajaj Auto has grown into a diversified retail lending business by expanding to consumer electronics, white goods and digital goods. While financing for consumer durables, two-wheelers and personal loans are helping maximise profit, entry into mortgage, small business loans and commercial lending is aiding in building scale. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_7> “On behalf of Bajaj Finance, we are thrilled to receive this award,” Sanjiv Bajaj, managing director of holding company Bajaj Finserv, said about being adjudged the Company of the Year. “Our 12-year journey at Bajaj Finance has been to create an entrepreneurial-driven, innovative and high-quality lending business. Our focus is to build this into India’s first industrial-scale fintech lender.” Bajaj is vicechairman of Bajaj Finance.The company has grown assets under management by 41% and profit by 43%, even as margins and asset quality remained stable at end of June, despite the liquidity situation since the IL&FS crisis broke out in September 2018. The NBFC sector has seen disbursements shrink 30% in the period. In retail, Bajaj Finance has 37 million customers, 97,000 points of sale and a balance sheet of Rs 1.25 lakh crore.Key drivers at the company are Nanoo Pamnani, Bajaj and Rajeev Jain.Amid tight liquidity, Bajaj Finance maintained a Rs 6,400-crore liquidity buffer, with diversified liability mix bank borrowings at 35%, deposits at 16% and market borrowing at 39%. It is in the middle of raising funds to maintain leverage at about 6x.What came as a natural hedge for Bajaj Finance is a diversified product portfolio across tenors. After early warning signals in digital product and twowheeler financing, it slowed lending and brought in higher diligence.Gross non-performing loans remained at less than 2% backed by cautious lending. It cut down exposure to loans against property, infrastructure and construction, before stress seeped in. Investment in digital paid off. Zero-cost EMIs aided consumer durables lending. Bajaj Finance has been adding 1 million customers every quarter with initiatives such as cobranding wallet business, partnering with Mobikwik and co-branding credit card with RBL Bank.MethodologyThe categories of Company and Emerging Company of the year 2019 recognise only listed companies, and consider performance for the financial year 2018-19. The shortlists are prepared after extensive number crunching by ET’s research arm, ETIG.For the Company of the Year, profitable companies which were listed before April 1, 2018 with an average market cap for the month of March 2019 of over Rs 30,000 crore were considered. For the Emerging Company of the Year, profitable companies listed between April 2013 and March 2018 and incorporated after 2000 were considered.In both categories, ETIG used a set of financial data points to generate a composite score for each company, and ranked the companies on this score. The top five were shortlisted for discussion by the ET Awards jury.The data points used to generate the composite score are net sales (FY19), operating profit (FY19), net profit (FY19), market capitalisation (March 2019), return on equity (March 31, 2019), share price appreciation for the year March 31, 2018-March 31, 2019, growth in revenue over a three-year period (CAGR), growth in operating profit over a three-year period (CAGR) and growth in net profit over a three-year period (CAGR).Emerging company: Growing from the grassroots to the clouds <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_8> Bandhan’s transition into a bank from a microfinance company has been the Reserve Bank of India’s first such experiment turning into a resounding success.The microlender, which begun the journey in 2001 with practices to meet rural needs, had to shift its focus beyond villages and create a new ecosystem as it got off the block as a bank on August 23, 2015. In the next four years, it garnered Rs 43,700 crore of public deposits, a hallmark of trust and recognition across the spectrum. On the asset side, Bandhan’s outstanding loans crossed Rs 45,400 crore at end of June with growth as high as 39% year-on-year, amid chaos in the financial system which saw government banks reeling under asset quality stress and non-bank lenders facing heat with cash flow mismanagement.“The ET Award is a huge recognition to Bandhan’s business model which touches lives at the grassroots, and will be an inspiration to our entire workforce who helped create the Bandhan Bank brand in just about four years,” founder and managing director Chandra Shekhar Ghosh said. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_9> “The award is a responsibility bestowed upon the Bandhan family.” Supported by marquee global investors such as GIC and International Finance Corporation, Bandhan has added 7.25 lakh new bank accounts in the June quarter alone to create a massive customer pool of 1.73 crore. It has 1,000 bank branches, along with more than 3,000 doorstep service centres catering to its 1.36 crore micro credit customers, much to the envy of its rivals. About 75% of its offices are in the unbanked districts, which makes Bandhan an important player for the government’s financial inclusion drive.The lender, with 85% exposure to economically weak borrowers, is in the final stages of acquiring housing finance company Gruh Finance with Rs 17,700 crore, which will not only help diversify its loan portfolio but also provide geographical balance.“We still have an unexplored market in microfinance, in MSMEs, in housing loan segment. Till these markets exhaust, there is no point in experimenting with the big-ticket loan market,” Ghosh had said in an interview to ET in July.Bandhan’s June quarter profit grew 45.4% to Rs 701 crore. On the same yardstick, IDFC First Bank, the other one to get a universal banking licence along with Bandhan, posted a loss of Rs 617 crore. A net interest margin as high as 10.45% (for the first quarter) keeps Bandhan Bank’s profitability high. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_10>  <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_11> Business Reformer: A CM who never sleeps   In a few weeks from now, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will face probably the most consequential elections so far in his political career.In 2014, Fadnavis was just one among the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in the state who lived and worked in the shadow of seniors such as Nitin Gadkari. A Nagpur boy, few expected him to scale and occupy the highest political position in the state. One of the questions to be answered in the upcoming state elections is whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s gamble in overlooking other party leaders with prominent caste support and selecting Fadnavis as the chief minister in the winter of 2014 has paid off or not.The Maharashtra chief minister has earned many admirers, especially for the manner in which he has pushed for a massive infrastructure upgrade in Mumbai as well as the rest of the state, something that the ET Awards jury cited when making its decision. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_12> “Maharashtra has always been at the forefront in attracting industries,” Fadnavis told ET. “It however had been lagging behind other states in the last few years,which is why when we came to power we initiated various ease of doing business measures to attract more investment and ensure that companies don’t face hurdles. And the results are in front of us. We have received Rs 3.75 lakh crore FDI (foreign direct investment) in five years compared to Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the previous five years. This award is a recognition that we are on the right path and that also pushes us to achieve more.”One of his first acts after he came to power was to set up a war room in the state administration and get people from the private sector to run it. The war room helped execute projects at a rapid pace. For instance, the 11.40 km Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar metro project took more than 15 years to plan and execute under earlier governments. In contrast, the Fadnavis government is pushing to complete the more challenging 33-km underground Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ line by December 2021. The war room chaired by the chief minister is also working on projects such as the coastal road and the Mumbai-Nagpur expressway.With many industries complaining about delay in getting clearances, the chief minister, within a year of coming to power, halved the number of permissions needed to set up an industry in the state to 37 from 75. Fadnavis has also been instrumental in cutting time needed for project clearances, though businessmen still complain about harassment by municipal and district-level officials. While the state administration at the top has been receptive to investment and keen on speeding up clearances, local problems still persist in some sectors.A little-known aspect of his style of governance is the appointment of people with out-of-the-box thinking and integrity to key posts such as that of the Mumbai Police Commissioner or the Maharashtra DGP’s post. The chief minister has not just focused on industries but also on agriculture.He has pushed for more agro-processing industries and for establishing cold-chain centres in rural regions.Entrepreneur: He always delivers, and so does his company <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_13> Sriharsha MajetyCEO, SwiggyIn just five years of starting up, Swiggy cofounder Sriharsha Majety has built one of the largest online fooddelivery companies that can rival many global counterparts in size. Its rapid scale up and diversification into areas outside of food delivery made Majety the elite jury’s choice for Entrepreneur of the Year this year.Widely known for his execution skills in the fledgling consumer internet industry, Majety has expanded Swiggy into several new areas, launching grocery delivery, on-demand concierge and a bunch of private label food brands over the past year, as he sets sight beyond food delivery.“It’s very exciting to get validation for the work we’re doing at Swiggy and thanks to the many people who’ve helped us get this far,” said Majety on winning the award. “I think our focus on customer service has helped us get here and is what will push us in the future as well.”Swiggy has grown from clocking around 700,000 orders a day till a year ago to doubling that number to 1.4 million daily orders today, becoming among the fastest growing Indian consumer internet startups.Aside of the genetic growth, Swiggy’s diversification foray has been pushed by Majety’s belief that hyper-local deliveries are at the core of great customer service. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_14> Swiggy’s expansion beyond food started in September last year when it acquired hyper-local delivery startup Supr Daily.Seen as a bid to utilise its already large fleet, now at 45,000 agents, to deliver for categories beyond food, within six months the company launched Swiggy Stores—a rival to Dunzo and BigBasket—that curates inventory from stores near users’ locations to deliver everything from flowers to health supplements.Swiggy’s diversification mirrors that of China’s largest food delivery network Meituan-Dianping, which has a small stake in the company. “The capability of having India’s largest delivery fleet will be a key driver towards building many businesses over time,” said Majety. “That’s the one thing that I am very happy about having built and we will continue to invest in it.”Its expansion is being funded by a $1-billion cheque investors cut for Swiggy in December last year, $650 million of which came from its largest backer, South African internet and media conglomerate Naspers. This also valued the company at $3.3 billion, making it among the most valuable internet firms in the country.In a recent interview with ET, Bob van Dijk, the group CEO of Prosus and Naspers, while talking about Majety and the competition Swiggy faces against Zomato said, “The reason why we are so comfortable with Swiggy is basically that Harsha and his team have shown their abilities to execute really well. I think we have our bet on the winner, and the potential of the market is huge”.Losses, however, continue to mount for Swiggy and its monthly cash burn of $40-50 million is being questioned.In the year ended March 31, 2018, its losses soared 93% to Rs 397 crore on revenue of Rs 422 crore, but its revenue growth zoomed 232%.Corporate Citizen: For child, community & country <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_15> Wipro, India’s fourth largest IT company, involves its employees in giving back to society and the neighbourhoods where it operates, through Wipro Cares. The impact of this is measured. In 2018-19, more than 12,500 employees of Wipro spent around 30,000 hours of volunteering time with partner organisations at 20 locations in India, the US, the UK, Japan, Australia and the Philippines. The company engages employees to imbibe founder Azim Premji’s philosophy of contributing back to society in education, primary health care, community ecology and disaster rehabilitation.As a business, more than 40% of its electricity consumption is from renewable sources; over 42% of freshwater requirement, or about 1,400 million litres a year, is met through treatment and recycling of water equivalent to one day’s consumption of Bengaluru, a city of more than 12 million people.“Wipro is an exemplar of a successful, ethical and a socially responsible organisation,” Premji wrote in his letter to employees when he stepped down from his executive role at Wipro in June. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_16> Wipro’s journey towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) began in 2001 with its first intervention in school education. Since then, it has expanded to participate in community care and ecology and environment. It set up the Wipro Foundation, a separate entity created in 2017, to manage its CSR programmes.The Bengaluru-based company’s business practices and activities in giving back to society have won it the 2019 The Economic Times Corporate Citizen of The Year Award.“We are deeply honoured by this recognition. It is the dedication and hard work of over 175,000 Wiproites across the globe that has made us what we are,” chairman Rishad Premji said. “This award further strengthens our resolve in contributing to developing a just, equitable, humane and sustainable world”.Wipro’s strategy has been to develop and strengthen organisations that work in making systemic reforms in school education in India. It has partnered with more than 116 organisations across 22 states in India with an effective reach to 20,000 schools, 40,000 educators and a million children. Through Wipro Cares, the company addresses the needs of more than 40,000 children from underprivileged communities and 2,200 children with disability.It also has Wipro-earthian, a programme to engage students on sustainability. It has reached over 2,200 schools and 2,600 teachers in 32 states and union territories.Wipro has not just focused on helping its community within India. Through the Wipro Cares initiative, employees engage with disadvantaged communities which are proximate to its facilities. Wipro Science Education Fellowship, which began in 2012, is a programme designed to develop teachers’ capacities to teach better in their schools and help other teachers teach better.It has replicated this model in the US and UK.Policy Change Agent: A unique achievement via hard work <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_17> Rarely has a bureaucrat been given charge of so many crucial government positions simultaneously. For softspoken Ajay Bhushan Pandey, juggling key positions comes with ease. As serving chief executive of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the 57-yearold bureaucrat was given additional charge as chairman of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Network in September 2017.In addition to spearheading these two crucial government projects, Pandey, a 1984 Maharashtra Cadre Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, was appointed revenue secretary in November last year.Pandey was instrumental in scaling up use of Aadhaar in delivery of government subsidies and benefits, which led to savings of over Rs 90,000 crore by eliminating ‘ghosts’ and duplicates.“It is under his steering that Aadhaar has earned worldwide acclaim,” the government said when it appointed him revenue secretary last year. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_18> The government called his stint at UIDAI “remarkable” and added that he played a key role in establishing and steering Aadhaar across the country and drafting the historic Aadhaar legislation for providing statutory basis to the unique identity.“He also successfully explained Aadhaar and its benefits and the underlying technology to the five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court through his two day long power-point presentation in the open court room, which helped the government in successfully defending the Aadhaar case against 37 petitions,” the government had said.This work won him the ‘Policy Change Agent’ in a near unanimous vote from the high-profile jury for the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence 2019.“This award is recognition of Aadhaar which has empowered more than 120 crore Indians with a lifelong digital and secure identity for ease of living,” Pandey told ET. “Aadhaar has helped transform the governance, brought in transparency and ensured that government benefits and subsidies are directly delivered to the deserving and marginalised sections of the society,” he added.Pandey is a graduate in electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur. He also secured an MS and a PhD in computer science from the University of Minnesota. Prior to joining UIDAI in 2010—in the early days of the project— Pandey handled several key positions in his state cadre of Maharashtra, which included land revenue management, sales tax department, and the information technology ministry, among others.Known for his frank talk, after taking over as revenue secretary, Pandey said his priorities were to help the government improve tax-GDP ratio, enhance tax compliance through integration of technology, stabilise the implementation of GST, and bring transparency and simplification of laws and procedures for better tax administration, particularly for startups, and ease of doing business.Pandey was instrumental in ensuring that every communication from the income tax department carries a document identification number or DIN, verifiable on department’s portal, to bring about transparency and accountability in its functioning. <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_19>  <IMG Economictime_PL_3007_News_20>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/et-awards-2019-the-superlative-c-suite-decides-winners-of-et-awards-for-corporate-excellence/articleshow/71367357.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3007_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Every award was a two-step decision.

Patanjali, which had challenged multinationals’ dominance in the consumer segment, also saw its overall sales decline in FY18-19.The slowdown of Patanjali came initially on trade disruptions caused by the GST regime two years ago and then strong competition from large companies who shored up their portfolio with own ayurvedic offerings.“They faced distribution turmoil soon after GST as they were not equipped with handling return of goods. Also, many companies launched natural variants as well as matched prices, which impacted Patanjali, which had limited distribution network compared to established firms,” said Abneesh Roy, executive vice-president of institutional equities, at Edelweiss Research.About 60% of all new launches in 2018 were in the natural space, a 49% jump from two years ago, a recent Kantar report said. <IMG Economictime_PL_3017_News_1> At present, Patanjali has more than 200,000 sales counters and about 100 Patanjali mega stores.

But it is done with large acquisitions for now.“Our key geographies of India, Brazil and Germany are where we expect future growth avenues to come from. We are seeing from other companies, too, a lot more focus back on the Indian market,” said Aman Mehta, chief marketing officer of Torrent Pharma.Aman is the son of Samir Mehta, founder and CEO of Torrent Pharma. He will be expected to take over the reins of the pharma business from his father in the coming years. The 28-year-old, a graduate of Columbia Business School, however, says that as a professionally run organisation, his succession will also be a step-by-step process.“For us it is about diving deep into one role first and then moving to other roles, rather than the other way round.

So it is about taking it step-by-step”, Mehta told ET in an exclusive interview.<IMG Economictime_PL_3020_News_1> For now, he said, the focus of the company will be on launching new products in categories such as cardiology and diabetes, which is also the fastest growing therapy segment in India.Torrent is betting on its new launches like cardiac drug Ticagrelor and anti-diabetic drug Vildagliptin and Remogliflozin for its future quarter growth.In 2019, Torrent reported 13% growth in sales to Rs 4,328 crore, when the overall market grew at 9%.The Indian pharma market, once the darling of investors, has come under pressure in the last five years. Regulatory actions in the US markets and policy changes at home, including price cuts and the implementation of GST, have chipped away the double-digit growth of companies that had churned out billionaires from the sector.Torrent, too, has come under US drug regulator USFDA’s scrutiny for quality issues.

However, in India, Chromebooks have failed to take off on the same level due to various reasons. That hasn’t stopped brands from launching a Chromebook every now and then to test the waters and this is exactly what HP is doing with the Chromebook x360.HP Chromebook x360 is one of the best-looking Chromebooks we have come across. HP has given it a premium look and feel with a matte white ceramic finish. It weighs just 1.68kg and has a tapered design which makes it easy to carry around as well. We did notice that the white colour top lid tends to pick up dirt quickly and required cleaning regularly. The x360 is a convertible - it comes with a fluid chrome plated hinge enabling the screen to be rotated 360 degrees. Like any convertible laptops, you can rotate the screen to any angle and use it as a laptop, a touchscreen tablet or tent mode for a presentation. There are few Chromebooks with this convertible design and combined with the plethora of apps available on Chrome App store, it makes the Chromebook x360 great for any type of usage.The 14-inch display is bright and shows vivid colours. It has slim bezels on the sides which helps reduce the overall footprint of the laptop. The touchscreen works great for input, gestures as well as for gaming. The good thing is that it is full HD resolution which makes the screen a joy to use for multimedia, gaming as well as reading. In terms of ports, it has a full-size USB port, a headphone/mic jack, microSD slot and dual USB Type-C port (one on each side). You can use either USB Type-C port for charging which is a feature we hope a lot of other brands adopt. We loved the chicklet style keyboard – the keys have a good amount of travel and its comfortable to type. Plus, it is backlit which is always a great feature to have on a laptop. Its trackpad is also large and responsive plus works great for gestures on Chrome OS. <IMG Economictime_PL_3039_News_1> Opting between Chrome OS and Windows depends on the user requirements. However, in case you are wondering how good is Chrome OS, then you should know that it has come a long way since its announcement. Not only does the OS work great for basic usage of internet surfing and multimedia, but it also proved to be great for productivity and office work. You get access to all the apps and games available on Google Play store on Android. We used it to play PUBG and it worked butter smooth even though it ran on medium graphics settings. Switching between running apps was instant and we faced no issues accessing content on USB flash drives and hard drives. Performance is zippy thanks to the hardware although we do feel that 64GB of internal storage feels limiting. You can add a MicroSD slot for storage expansion but at the asking price, it would have been great if it came with at least 128GB storage.Battery life is one of the big highlights of the Chromebook x360. With basic usage of Google docs, multimedia playback and surfing on chrome, we got a backup of slightly over 11 hours on a single charge regularly. This makes it ideal for a full day of usage. HP uses a Type-C port for charging, so you get a compact size charger that is easy to carry around. Some of the other features that impressed us include the loud speakers, dedicated volume buttons on the side and dual band WiFi connectivity. What we didn’t like is the sub-par webcam quality. One of the big reasons in my opinion for the lack of Chromebook adoption in India has been its price. Considering that you can get a laptop running Windows OS for almost half the price of this Chromebook, it will be difficult for this one to find a lot of success in the end consumer space. In the same price segment, you can easily get Windows-based convertible laptops such as the Lenovo Yoga 530 or HP Pavilion x360.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/hp-chromebook-x360-review-great-for-workplace-productivity-good-battery-life/articleshow/70797200.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3039_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Battery life is one of the big highlights of the HP Chromebook x360.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3039_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70797368,width-650,imgsize-275943,,resizemode-4,quality-100/battery-life-is-one-of-the-big-highlights-of-the-hp-chromebook-x360-.jpg"}, {"caption": "HP Chromebook x360's 14-inch display is bright and shows vivid colours.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3039_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70797377,quality-100/hp-chromebook-x360s-14-inch-display-is-bright-and-shows-vivid-colours-.jpg"}]}

Alphonso mango is the latest addition. The first farm product to get a GI tag in India was Darjeeling tea in 2004. <IMG Economictime_PL_3057_News_1> “We are developing quality assurance system for GIs since there are certain products that are popular with foreign audiences,” the official added. “The idea of governments promoting local GI products is not unheard of. Scotch whisky is one such example. The move will benefit local art and craft industry,” said an expert on intellectual property rights.GI tags are awarded to products that have a specific geographic origin and possess qualities or a reputation due to that place. Once a country accords GI status to a product, its name cannot be used by producers of the same product at a different place.The government wants to popularise existing GIs so that both producers and consumers recognise their significance, according to the official.“Just like the government has associated itself with Khadi, now they want GI products to be easily identifiable and maintain integrity of such products. This is a positive step, especially at a time when the European Union has a strong regime on GIs and IPR,” said another IPR expert.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/government-wants-gi-products-on-bigger-retail-canvas/articleshow/66980560.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3057_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The first farm product to get a GI tag in India was Darjeeling tea in 2004.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3057_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-66980612,width-300,imgsize-245789,,resizemode-4,quality-100/tea-think.jpg"}, {"caption": "Retail-BCCL", "id": "Economictime_PL_3057_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-66980632,quality-100/retail-bccl.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Four years into a slide, Audi hopes to fight back with new cars", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3067_News_0>MUMBAI: Audi is staring at its lowest sales this decade in India as a slowing automobiles market, weak product portfolio mix, and mounting competition combine to dent volumes. The German luxury car maker is, however, putting in place a strategy to rebuild volumes by 2022.ET learns that this will be the fourth consecutive year of decline for Audi in India, and the car maker is set to close this year with sales of just 5,000 units, a fall of more than 27% since last year - and the lowest absolute volumes since 2010.The first to cross the five-digit sales mark in 2013, Audi is headed into a rough patch for the next two years, with the company deciding to exit diesel cars after April 2020. Some of its entry-level cars - A3, Q3 and Q5 – have already seen the end of local production.To be sure, Indian luxury car market too is staring at a double-digit decline in 2019, but Audi's slide is more pronounced. Audi India, head Rahil Ansari, said in his last interview before returning to the headquarters that the next two years will be tough for the industry. Audi has put in place a roadmap, with Balbir Singh Dhillion as the new head of the Indian operations, to get back to the volumes game by 2022. Ansari's last day was 31st August 2019. “I do agree that we have been silent and we didn't have sufficient product ammunition in the past 12 months. There are some gaps in our portfolio; we have informed the HQ about the same. The cars are coming now to create some excitement,” added Ansari.The new A6 is coming in the second half of September, the new A8 and Q8 are coming in December and then E-Tron next year. However, for the entry segment A3 and Q3 that account for over a third of volumes, there is no visibility on the A3 BS VI version yet, the Q3 BS VI may come as a CBU and Q5 is likely to get a go-ahead for BS VI option with local manufacturing. The company may look at adding Q2 in the CBU avatar as well.Ansari was non-committal on local production of specific models. He, however, said that there is going to be a gap for local production for some BS VI products.With limited local manufacturing for entry-level models for a few years and no diesel for the immediate future, people in the know say the company’s volumes may further slide in 2020 to below 4,000.Ansari said that for Audi the growth phase will start from 2022 onwards and until then, it is preparation time to boost volumes, with a long-term focus on petrol and hybrid cars. <IMG Economictime_PL_3067_News_1> The company attributes the fall in volumes and market share to both local and global factors. Taxes and the slowing economy pulled volumes down locally, whereas transition to the global WLTP has led to new launches getting delayed until the second half of 2019.Experts reckon that constant change in top management has hurt many international car brands, and the relocation of Ansari to a global role happens at a crucial juncture for the brand. The appointment of Dhillon would ensure continuity as he was already a part of the leadership team.Industry insiders say that the lack of focus from HQ on India has hurt brand Audi in the domestic market. Ansari refuted the claim, saying that despite the low volumes, India as a market is often discussed by the board.Ansari acknowledged that HQ expectations of India to deliver higher volumes and quicker growth have not materialized, but the delay is due to the rupee depreciation and high duties, besides other factors.“HQ is surprised by the frequency of change. While GST has remained stable, other taxes have crept up, compelling us to look at price increases,” added Ansari.Audi has also been hurt by dealership closures, and the company reckons bringing back Dhillon will help the brand as he understands the dealer ecosystem well.Ansari said the broader market is expected to remain tough for the next 12-24 months.With the channel partners also sensitized about the future business plans, Ansari said the focus was now on bringing about a mindset change and looking at opportunities such as BS VI petrol instead of BS VI diesel. “Not having a diesel is a USP, I think,” he said.“There is no growth expected but it will consolidate. But we're clear about this. The company's okay with this,” said Ansari. “The company has basically decided that this is the way forward for India. We will first test the waters and see. We will start with the A6 as petrol. And Q8 will come as petrol, and the A8 will come as petrol.”", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/four-years-into-a-slide-audi-hopes-to-fight-back-with-new-cars/articleshow/70941308.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3067_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Audi is headed into a rough patch for the next two years.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3067_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70941318,width-300,imgsize-747448,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_3067_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70941314,quality-100/2.jpg"}]}

Consequently, many companies and start-ups have gone out of their own domain and pitched support to the fight by manufacturing sanitisers and face masks to help mitigate the crisis. Navi Mumbai-based menstrual products start-up Saral Designs, led by Suhani Mohan and Karthik Mehta, joined hands with the Mahindra Group to modify their sanitary pad-making machine into producing 3-ply surgical masks.  Bengaluru-based Bione launches India's first at-home testing kit for Covid-19On Friday, Anand Mahindra virtually inaugurated the Mumbai plant set up within the auto major's premises in the Kandivali factory. Pawan Goenka, Managing Director of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), took to Twitter to announce that the production of 3-ply masks will start today. Posting a video from the plant, Goenka said that Mahindra engineers worked with the Saral team day and night to set up the manufacturing unit in in four days. The company plans to ramp up the production to 10,000 masks per day in the next fortnight. The surgical masks will be UV-sterilised and come with a bacteria filter layer of 99.95 per cent efficiency.Mahindra was impressed with Mohan who is an IIT-Bombay graduate, and called her a hero who had moved from banking to entrepreneurship. She had started making menstrual hygiene products and had then sought Mahindra's help to make face masks for healthcare professionals and other coronavirus warriors, he shared in a tweet with his followers. The 64-year-old business tycoon also mentioned Shruti Agarwal, Mohan's junior at IIT, in his tweet. He also said this could be the sequel to the 2018 Akshay Kumar-starrer ‘Padman'.

{"title": "Germ theory: How probiotic products are flying off the shelves", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3120_News_0>The gastroenterology department on the ninth floor of the new building at the 95-year-old King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai’s Parel is no different from the rest of the hospital — crowded, with relatives of patients waiting in corridors, and often making a bed for themselves on the staircase. A room on the floor serves as the office of Shobna Bhatia, head of the department, an old hand at research on probiotics and expert on the use of human gut bacteria in the treatment of intestinal diseases. Her current research is focused on finding alternatives to the usual medicines that deal with problems related to the human digestive system. Her team is researching how the source of discomfort in the tummy might actually lie in the brain (think tummy aches before exams). Bhatia elucidates the problems she faces on the use of probiotics, live cultures of human gut bacteria, and bacterial spores, in treatment. Back in 1989, research by a group of doctors, led by Bhatia, had showed lactobacillus acidophilus, the socalled good bacteria usually found in the human gut, destroyed another bacteria, campylobacter pylori, often blamed for causing acid peptic disease. However, when the good bacteria were used to treat patients’ symptoms, there weren’t enough positive results. Bhatia explains that, like her own research, much of the research around probiotics are far from providing a clinching evidence of the medicinal ability of probiotics. Bhatia uses probiotics sparingly, for treating noninfective diarrhoea and antibiotics-induced diarrhoea. However, probiotics have moved beyond such limited uses. Plenty of over-the-counter (OTC) probiotic products are available as curd or fermented. ed milk or other kinds of drinks. The market is burgeoning. According to Varun Suri, CEO of consumer division of Morepen Laboratories, ethical (drugs that need a prescription) probiotics market is Rs 1,100 crore, while the OTC market could be many times bigger. A reputed gastroenterologist, who spoke to ET Magazine on condition of anonymity, says patients often put pressure on him to prescribe probiotics. The doctor, who practises at a top private hospital in Mumbai, says there are far-fetched claims about bacteria found in the human body that can be used to induce diabetes, obesity and even autism. Doctors agree that research findings, as of today, are inadequate regarding specific benefits of probiotics (beneficial bacteria), the efficacy of different strains and the quantity to be used. It will take another decade for clarity to emerge, they add. There could be scenarios where probiotics might be harmful. Indian pharma companies are, however, keen to make the most of the market. Suri of Morepen adds: “In the ethical market, probiotics are mostly yeast-based or spores-based, which is limiting. Live bacteria cultures, which add variety to the flora of the gut and body, are few. Also, those live bacteria do not survive stomach acids completely, so efficacy is a question.” Probiotics and prebiotics (material that allow gut bacteria to thrive) are being consumed for all kinds of reasons, including for taste. Introduction of healthy gut bacteria harvested from the stool of a healthy donor, either through an enema or orally, has also gained ground. Stool donation by super donors — whose bodies have specific strains of useful bacteria — might soon be in vogue in India. It is already prevalent in other markets. Super donors can earn up to $40 per sample, according to one estimate. Morepen is gearing up to meet the challenges of the probiotic market and solve the key problem of delivering live bacteria into the right part of the human body, and in adequate quantity. Suri says Morepen has tied up with Vesale Pharma of Belgium to overcome the delivery challenges of probiotics, and will be launching their products in India in a few months. Mankind Pharma is another company betting big on probiotics. “I think probiotics have a role to play in fighting all diseases,” says Rajat Singhal, senior manager-medical affairs, Mankind Pharma. “Over the years, it has evolved for different therapy areas. Doctors have started prescribing it with antibiotics to deal with cardiology-related issues and diabetes. We, at Mankind, are looking at respiratory and peadiatric applications.” Some pharma companies that have older probiotic products are keen to repackage them and try and fight other diseases. Yakult, a popular brand of probiotic fermented milk, marketed in India by Yakult Danone India, has put up many research papers on its website for anyone who cares to check. Back in 2011, the Indian Council of Medical Research released a set of guidelines for use of probiotics in food, through a report prepared by a committee of experts. The scene has changed rapidly since then, and multiple bodies of probiotics industry are already active in India now. Kefir Milk and Kombucha are two of the probioticbased health drinks that have caught the fancy of the Indian urban market. Kefir is a grain found in the mountains of east Europe. When the grain is fermented, it is believed to produce lactic acid, which is also produced by lactobacillus. In the past four years, kefir-based brands such as MO’s and Kefir Life have reached the Indian market. Abhimanyu Singh Rathore, who launched KefirLife in the National Capital Region, says he is targeting just about 1% of the OTC probiotic market. In some cases, probiotics have gone beyond treatment and have emerged as a fad. But, as experts say, there are too many grey areas for comfort.GREY AREAS OF THE GUT  Lack of definitive research on effectiveness of probiotics treatment, especially comparative studies between different cultures of bacteria.Uncertainty over whether probiotics may harm patients, as administered bacteria might leak out of the digestive system and into other organsLack of monitoring of patients and how probiotics are being bought or ingested, with or without prescriptions.Uncertainty over effectiveness of imported culturesA brief history on INGESTING BACTERIAJohn Harvey Kellog  The American doctor and nutritionist (also the inventor of breakfast cereals), was an early proponent of probiotics or use of intestinal flora or bacteria for well-being. His late 19th century method used a pint of yogurt, half of it administered orally and the other half as enema.Ilya Mechnikov  Russian scientist and Nobel Prize winner in 1906, for his theories on phagocytosis, suggested senility was an effect of chemicals produced by bacteria that reside in the human gut. He proposed a diet of fermented milk containing bacilii that produced lactic acid. This diet became hugely popularIsmar Isidor Boas  a contemporary of both Kellog and Mechnikov, identified lactobacillus acidophilus, the lactic acid producing bacteria.<IMG Economictime_PL_3120_News_1> Since the 1980s, doctors started prescribing lactobacillus for a whole range of conditions.The new millennium saw an information explosion, linking human body bacteria with obesity to fatty livers and even autism and use of probiotics for treatment.Faecal microbiota transplant (donor stool administered as enema or orally in small quantities in capsules), which introduced healthy gut bacteria into the intestine, is now used for treating some forms of ulcerative colitis.POPULAR PROBIOTIC PRODUCTS Brands like Vizylac, Vibact or Nutrolin B Plus are often prescribed, along with antibiotics like amoxicillin, to prevent the onset of diarrhoea.<IMG Economictime_PL_3120_News_2> Brands like VSL 3 or Enterogermina are expensive, contain live bacteria, need refrigeration and can be used for inflammatory bowel diseases.Probiotic yogurt containing live spores of bacteria and fermented milk, by brands such as Amul or Yakult, is available over the counter.<IMG Economictime_PL_3120_News_3>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/germ-theory-how-probiotic-products-are-flying-off-the-shelves/articleshow/67397718.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3120_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Plenty of over-the-counter (OTC) probiotic products are available as curd or fermented milk or other kinds of drinks.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3120_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67397881,width-300,imgsize-317131,,resizemode-4,quality-100/germ-thumb.jpg"}, {"caption": "germ5", "id": "Economictime_PL_3120_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67397928,quality-100/germ5.jpg"}, {"caption": "germ7", "id": "Economictime_PL_3120_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67397932,quality-100/germ7.jpg"}, {"caption": "germ8", "id": "Economictime_PL_3120_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67397941,quality-100/germ8.jpg"}]}
{"title": "82% healthcare startups are offering improved affordability in their products: EY survey", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3145_News_0>The Indian health care system is being reshaped by three forces: increasing health care demand, technological ubiquity and rising patient awareness, says a report. Rising prevalence of lifestyle related diseases and an ageing population are the major factors leading to increasing demand of specialised health care in India. EY announced the launch of the report ‘Life Sciences 4.0: transforming health care in India’ at BioAsia 2019, Hyderabad, on Tuesday. The report highlights how technology is disrupting the health care ecosystem in India as we are entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0).However, the Indian health care system currently lacks sufficient infrastructure to meet the health care demands of the country. This lack of sufficient health care infrastructure has led to a supply-demand imbalance, making health care less affordable and accessible for all. While a steep supply-demand imbalance is visible in the country, India at the same time is also one of the fastest technology adopters, globally. While the health care industry in the country has started showing early signs of disruption, it is critical that the life sciences companies get ready to lead the change. Indian life sciences companies have started taking small, experimental steps on their journey. Some of the key areas where the companies have started adopting digital technologies include patient engagement (tools/services for increasing patient awareness about disease/health), physician engagement (tools/services for sharing educational material; interactive portals to connect, etc.), field force effectiveness (technology interfaces such as tabs for e-detailing and easy day-to-day reporting; smart mobile apps for appointment bookings), R&D efficiency (clinical trial data management solutions; technology and data to improve R&D productivity), and supply chain management (use of software to streamline supply and demand and connect buyers to sellers quickly). Range of innovative solutions developed by the surveyed startups:       There are broadly four business models that can describe majority of the Indian life sciences companies. Each of these types of companies need to invest into building capabilities dependent on their chosen business models.The Indian health care industry has already started showing early signs of disruption: <IMG Economictime_PL_3145_News_1> Sriram Shrinivasan, Global Emerging Markets Health and Life Sciences Leader and National Health Services Sector Leader, EY in a statement said, “Today, in India and globally, technological advancements are redefining products and enabling customisation of services in the health care industry. Emerging technologies (robotics, blockchain, 3D printing and artificial intelligence) and scientific breakthroughs such as gene editing have led to the transformation of life sciences companies’ business models. Going forward, life sciences companies must invest in the three new capabilities: personalization, customer engagement and data literacy.”EY conducted a survey with 60 life sciences and healthcare startups in India to gauge the success factors, challenges, collaboration landscape, growth areas for startups and their digital maturity. 35% of startups highlighted that taking feedback from customers (patients and physicians) was one of the most important success factors, followed by focus on product innovation, and industrial and technical know-how of the resources. 42% of the respondents feel that receiving timely and substantial funding will provide opportunity for driving further business growth, while 38% felt product innovation and rising market potential due to rising incomes, health and technological awareness also have a key role to play. 23% of the respondents also pointed towards strong government support as a responsible factor for attaining the next level of business growth.“Digital health care is one of the key focus areas under the umbrella of the government’s digital initiatives. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has several initiatives designed to deliver better health outcomes and the ‘Ayushman Bharat’ program is another initiative towards ensuring better access, improved quality and affordable health care to the citizens of India,” said Shrinivasan in a statement.Digital deals by top global biopharma (20 companies) and Medtech companies (21 companies): <IMG Economictime_PL_3145_News_2> In terms of business challenges, the startups are facing, 35% mentioned receiving funding was the key challenge, followed by understanding of regulatory process and collaboration with bigger life sciences and healthcare companies. The lack of sufficient funding was evident from the fact that 43% percent of the respondents were bootstrapped while 42% are also leveraging government incubators. Further, the difficulty in getting into collaborations is also visible from the very low percentage (5%) of companies with more than 10 collaborations while majority (69%) have 0 to only 3 collaborations.With the changing pace of acceleration, life sciences companies, whether big or small need to invest in platform capabilities to capture future value, regardless of their business models. They must lay down an effective strategy to build a workplace of future and while doing so must align their talent and digital strategy with the overall organisational vision.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/82-healthcare-startups-are-offering-improved-affordability-in-their-products-ey-survey/articleshow/68168075.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3145_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "With the changing pace of acceleration, life sciences companies, whether big or small need to invest in platform capabilities to capture future value, regardless of their business models.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3145_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68168164,width-300,imgsize-401540,,resizemode-4,quality-100/thinkstockphotos-488644583.jpg"}, {"caption": "Graph2EY", "id": "Economictime_PL_3145_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-68168211,quality-100/graph2ey.jpg"}, {"caption": "Graph3EY", "id": "Economictime_PL_3145_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-68168237,quality-100/graph3ey.jpg"}]}
{"title": "FMCG companies wake up to a million Indias", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3147_News_0>Punjab likes tea with extra milk, so Hindustan Unilever (HUL) sells stronger blends in the state. The brand names are the same, the packaging is pan-Indian, but the tea itself changes from region to region. Welcome to the era of ‘micromarkets’ where one size no longer fits all, and marketers slug it out for dominance in each one of the ‘many Indias’.“Step back and compare South Mumbai to suburban Mumbai,” said HUL CFO Srinivas Phatak, “there’s a fundamental transformation in the profile of consumers.” Their tastes and budgets are different, so the way stores are stocked differs. For companies, the challenge is to achieve the right level of ‘disaggregation’. “If you are able to get that right, you are able to service the consumers very differently.” <IMG Economictime_PL_3147_News_1> The fight for every inch of ground is partly technology-driven. Earlier, the FMCG majors were in an unassailable position. Their scale of distribution and communication, and their brand equity, kept new players out. But now, any upstart can catch consumers’ attention on social media. This by itself may not weaken brand loyalty, but new brands can have phenomenal trial rates.HUL woke up to this changed reality first with its ‘Winning in Many Indias’ (WIMI) strategy that sorted the country into 14 clusters. Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) is launching its ‘Conquering Micro Markets’ (CMM) plan in phases, and Dabur India has lined up its ‘Project RISE’ (Regional Insights and Speed in Execution) that sees India as 12 geographical clusters. “Different states are growing differently from a GDP perspective, or in terms of infrastructure and agriculture,” said HUL executive director (home care) Priya Nair. “Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu are very different structurally, in terms of their GDP patterns, income profiles and consumer habits. The right strategy in Chhattisgarh is not equal to the right strategy in TN.”A company may be ahead in a region or a state, but focusing on micro-markets tells it where it can do better within the region. “We are zeroing in on micro-markets through what we call dynamic district regions or DDRs,” said GCPL CEO (India & SAARC) Sunil Kataria. “In UP alone we have around 7 DDRs. Till now, we would do maybe one television ad for entire UP. When we look at DDRs, the game changes completely.”“We used to be 4-5 branches a decade ago, and it worked very well for us then. Today, we think 14 WIMI clusters is the right way to do it. Maybe, in some time, it could be a completely different paradigm,” said HUL’s Phatak.Maharashtra is one of the biggest states for FMCG companies in terms of size and value. GCPL has divided it into seven smaller district clusters under its micro-markets plan — Vidarbha East, Vidarbha West, Marathwada, Khandesh, Kolhapur-Konkan, Desh Pune and Mumbai plus Thane. “There are pockets in Maharashtra where GCPL has headroom for growth. Our micro-marketing approach for cluster districts gives us an opportunity to understand these skews,” said Kataria. “Each of these districts exhibits its own unique cultural nuances in language, food, occupations and the media they consume.” <IMG Economictime_PL_3147_News_2> In Marathwada, for instance, both Marathi and Dakhini are spoken. It is drought-prone and under-developed. Vidarbha in the state’s east is surrounded by Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and most people speak Varhadi and Zadi dialects of Marathi and Hindi.Kataria said a region’s standard of living affects its media consumption, which is an important part of marketing strategy. “For example, in Vidarbha and Marathwada, TV is the lead media followed by mobile, while print and digital penetration is relatively less. However, in the Kolhapur-Konkan region, apart from TV, print and digital are also well received by consumers. In cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune, internet penetration is the highest along with the influence of cinema.” <IMG Economictime_PL_3147_News_3> How effective are these micromarket strategies? “In Northeast India, where Dabur did a pilot of Project RISE, revenue grew about 30% in the cluster,” said Dabur India CEO Mohit Malhotra. “We may get lead measures, but the final proof would be if my share changes in 4-5 months. In six months, we would like to see some quick wins. It will take one year to get an idea of how to do this,” said Kataria.Understanding the change is one thing, building a marketing strategy around it is another. Considering that India has 10 million FMCG outlets, of which about 6 million are in rural areas, the task is tough. Old-school marketing based on gut-feel doesn’t work anymore. Now, it’s all about deriving consumer insights from data.“It’s easier said than done. One thing we are realising is that the way we all learned marketing over the years is changing completely,” said Kataria, indicating that mindsets need to change. While GCPL will have a regional trade marketing head in each of its regions, it may need to double efforts for local implementation.Systems, processes and technology also need to be brought up to date to implement such a differentiated marketing plan. HUL has a head for each of its WIMI clusters. “We expect marketers to have a more experimental mindset. As an organisation, we are investing significantly in experimentation on how to win the consumer,” said Phatak, adding that anyone who has the scale and capabilities along with the ability to be agile, responsive and nimble will succeed.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/fmcg-companies-wake-up-to-a-million-indias/articleshow/70272157.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3147_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Maharashtra is one of the biggest states for FMCG companies in terms of size and value.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3147_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70272252,width-300,imgsize-637403,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "2", "id": "Economictime_PL_3147_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70272192,quality-100/2.jpg"}, {"caption": "3", "id": "Economictime_PL_3147_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70272268,quality-100/3.jpg"}, {"caption": "4", "id": "Economictime_PL_3147_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70272216,quality-100/4.jpg"}]}

This automated and tech-led warehouse, located in Hoskote area, is spread across 3,60,000 sqft. The launch is in line with Pepperfry’s aim to strengthen its services in South India, which contributes to 40% of the marketplace’s overall business.The facility is located along the highway and is equidistant from key demand centres in Bangalore, which results in a reduction in overall transit time and long-haul movement cost across markets, as well as allows hassle-free movement of vehicles. This improved infrastructure will also ensure overall customer experience will go up with faster delivery rates.The home and furniture segment is a category with big-ticket and bulky products, which require facilities that allow the use of airspace such that products can be stacked to maximize utilization of the floor space. The warehouse therefore has a clear height of 12 meters with VNA type flooring, roof insulation, ridge louvers for ventilation, motorized rolling shutters for docks, fire hydrant and sprinklers with fire NOC, a sewage treatment plant and premium wall fencing. <IMG Economictime_PL_3159_News_1> Ashish Shah, founder and COO, Pepperfry said in a statement, “South India is the largest market for us with a 40 percent contribution to our overall business, and the new warehouse will help us augment our business from the region.

{"title": "Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio in talks with US handset company Flex for smartphone production", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3165_News_0>Reliance Jio Infocomm is in talks with US contract manufacturer Flex for locally producing about 100 million mobile phone handsets as the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco seeks to rapidly enhance its market share by signing on the majority of those users now using feature phones. “Jio is in advanced discussions for a large order and that has caused a stir in the market, even prompting Flex to negotiate some tax benefits with the government in the SEZ where its factory is located,” a person familiar with matter told ET.Both Flex and Jio didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries.Another person said that Flex currently has the capacity to manufacture around 4-5 million devices per month at its factory in the special economic zone (SEZ) near Chennai. “However, the company wants to be able to sell the produced units in the domestic tariff area (DTAs), without attracting the duties, at rates similar to that of FTAs,” the person said.Telco Must Bear Maintenance CostsAny move by the government to allow selling goods produced in the SEZ in DTAs without attracting duties would allow the handsets to be priced affordably, making it attractive for the first-time smartphone buyers, said experts.It is only natural that Jio is targeting the next low-hanging fruit, the bulk of India’s 500 million featurephone users who would switch to smartphones if the bundled price points for the service and handsets were attractive. <IMG Economictime_PL_3165_News_1> Jio’s objective of rapidly gaining market share is clear from the size of the imminent order. Data from Counterpoint Research showed that 118 million and 134 million smartphones were sold in 2016 and 2017, respectively, in India. The agency expects the number to be around 150 million in 2018.An ICICI Securities report on the telecom regulator’s data showed that Vodafone Idea was leading the pack, with a revenue market share of 32.8%, followed by Bharti Airtel at 30.9%, and Reliance Jio at 26.1%.But Jio was making rapid gains, compared with losses of its rivals, due to largely expanding market share in the rural areas and tier-3 towns after the launch of its 4G VoLTE featurephone — JioPhone. Jio’s recent Monsoon Hungama offer of exchanging any old featurephone for a JioPhone for around Rs 1,000 (including six months recharge) has also proven to be a hit, with users of plainvanilla phones upgrading to 4G and contributing to the upsurge in Jio’s subscriber base at over 252 million by end-September. By contrast, Vodafone India and Bharti Airtel reported declines.PHONE SUBSIDY MODELA report by research firm Bernstien said that Jio’s phone subsidy model could help it lead the market in the future, especially if its rivals failed to match up. “If left unchallenged, we believe Jio could reach the leading revenue market share by 2021 and by subscribers by 2022. We now expect Jio to reach 28% revenue market share and 26% subscriber market share by the end of this financial year,” the report said.Navkender Singh, associate research director at market tracker IDC, said Jio is currently in a sweet spot, and could target the top end of featurephone users to convert them into the Rs 2,000-Rs 2,500 smartphone-user segment.“With its deep pockets, Jio is the best placed to seize the opportunity to upgrade at least the top 60% of the featurephone users,” Singh said, cautioning that the telco must bundle attractive plans.“To pull this off successfully, Jio will have to take care of the maintenance of the phone along with, may be, 1GB of data a day,” Singh said. He explained that one of the concerns deterring featurephone users from switching was the scare of easily broken screens, which could cost up to half of a new smartphone. “There is no point in buying a phone at Rs 2,000 if a broken screen would require a Rs 1,000 charge. So, Jio will have to absorb this cost if it wants customers to buy in,” Singh said.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/mukesh-ambanis-reliance-jio-in-talks-with-us-handset-company-flex-for-smartphone-production/articleshow/67101003.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3165_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Jio’s objective of rapidly gaining market share is clear from the size of the imminent order.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3165_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67101008,width-650,imgsize-99806,,resizemode-4,quality-100/jiophone-agencies.jpg"}, {"caption": "graph", "id": "Economictime_PL_3165_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67101018,quality-100/graph.jpg"}]}

It features a single rear camera instead of the multiple lens in the newest iPhone 11.The iPhone SE includes wireless charging and dual SIMs, and comes in black, red or white.While the iPhone had been in the works for months, the launch comes amid a pandemic-induced economic slump which has hammered the smartphone market and hit consumer sentiment.\"It is incredibly fortuitous timing,\" said Bob O'Donnell, analyst with Technalysis Research.\"This is the exactly the phone a large percentage of people will want. It's hard to justify spending $1,200 on a smartphone in this economic climate, yet people still depend heavily on their phones and a lot of people want to upgrade.\"O'Donnell said the new device is also likely to appeal to consumers seeking a small-format handset, and in countries where consumers may have not been able to afford iPhones.While the timing of a more affordable iPhone is good \"given the recession we are likely entering very soon,\" Apple would have been shrewd to fuel sales with financing offers such as postponing payments for a year, according to analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. <IMG Economictime_PL_3220_News_1>Without finance incentives, Moorhead said, \"I question how many of these the company actually wants to sell.\"Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said Apple had the devices were ready \"and ultimately decided to release and green light this smart phone to the market in hopes of gaining contained success out of the gates.\"Ives said in a note to investors he expects Apple to sell from 20 million to 25 million iPhone SE handsets by year's end.The Silicon Valley company played up the iPhone SE as a portal into its \"robust ecosystem\" of digital products and services including television and music streaming services.\"The first iPhone SE was a hit with many customers who loved its unique combination of small size, high-end performance and affordable price,\" said Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing.\"The new second-generation iPhone SE builds on that great idea and improves on it in every way.\"The move comes a week after South Korean colossus Samsung introduced new smartphones that included a model designed to work on much-hyped new-generation 5G mobile networks and priced less than $500.The new Apple smartphone \"fits into a portfolio and hitting the right price with the right features seems like a carefully balanced recipe,\" Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi said.\"It's a product that serves the purpose of getting the most pragmatic users to upgrade after holding on to their phones for years. These users might be coming from a hand-me-down or a secondhand iPhone or even be Android users looking for their first iPhone.\"Analysts question whether Apple will stick to its schedule of releasing a high-end device in September due to the current economic situation and disruption to the supply chain.\"I'm hearing production is ramping up in most parts of the supply chain,\" O'Donnell said.\"So they could still release new high-end phones in the fall if they want to.

{"title": "Incense winning mosquito war, repellent makers feel the bite", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3270_News_0>Google’s parent company and Bill Gates may be investing in technologies to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases but mainstream mosquito repellent makers in India are seeing a slowdown in their business.For market leader Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) and Jyothy Laboratories, the household insecticides category has degrown in the last three years due to competition from fast-acting imported incense sticks and also on account of climate change that impacts the breeding pattern of mosquitoes. Incidentally, the slowdown also coincides with the ramp up of the cleanliness drive in the country, though a direct causation cannot be drawn.<IMG Economictime_PL_3270_News_1> For the quarter ended March 2019, GCPL’s revenue from the home insecticides business stood at Rs 553 crore, down 6 per cent from a year ago, having declined at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6 per cent in the preceding two years. Likewise, for Jyothy the revenue declined 4.4 per cent to Rs 100 crore for the quarter ended March and dropped at a CAGR of 2 per cent in the previous three years.An Edelweiss equity research report in October last year had held the incense sticks to be a new disruption in the household insecticide segment, especially in rural areas. According to the report, sales of incense sticks have been growing at the fastest pace within the household insecticides segment, as consumers shifted to it from coils. Among the sticks, the illegal incense sticks are very highly dosed with chemicals that are banned for in-home usage.Both GCPL and Jyothy have launched their own incense stick brands to reclaim lost market share. In GCPL’s earnings call last week, managing director Vivek Gambhir mentioned that the company is working with authorities to shut down factories manufacturing illegal sticks, cautioning the sellers and trade channels about the illegality of the products and driving consumer awareness towards the hazards of using illegal sticks.Besides the product-related disruption, climate change has also impacted the mosquito repellent business. “Extreme weather conditions and extended summer and winter have impacted the incidence of mosquitoes,” said Ulhas Kamath, joint managing director of Jyothy Labs.The GCPL’s management does not ascribe to the notion that mosquito infestation is going down.While GCPL is hopeful of the category’s growth on the back of launch of new products, Jyothy has been reducing its overall share of business from this category. “We have managed to reduce the share of mosquito repellent products to 12-13 per cent of the total revenue from the peak share of 22 per cent,” said Kamath.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/incense-winning-mosquito-war-repellent-makers-feel-the-bite/articleshow/69262760.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3270_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3270_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-69262760,width-210,imgsize-92937,,resizemode-4,quality-100/.jpg"}, {"caption": "Snip X", "id": "Economictime_PL_3270_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-69262847,quality-100/snip-x.jpg"}]}

The exchange may launch the contract in May, with delivery in June.“The economic utility of this product is very high to the rice-processing trade like millers and tillers and exporters. They usually have a holding period of five months to a year for basmati rice and any price volatility impacts them badly,” Sanjit Prasad, managing director of ICEX, told ET.“This variety of rice is not covered under the minimum support price. Hence, an electronic trading platform lends itself to a fair and transparent price-discovery process, keeping in mind the demand and supply forces of the commodity. The commodity exhibits very high price volatility, up to 70 per cent, annually.” Iran is the largest buyer of the basmati 1121 variety from India.<IMG Economictime_PL_3275_News_1> “We have seen that sudden policy changes of the US regarding Iran made this commodity vulnerable to volatility, putting the rice processing and exporting industry to huge risk. With the introduction of futures contracts, the trade will be able to hedge the risk,” said Prasad, chief executive of ICEX. Domestic consumption of this commodity is also witnessing high growth. The exchange has been working on this for over a year and has been in touch with several market participants to understand the contours of the contract.The physical market size of basmati paddy 1121 is around 10 million tonnes and the estimated value is about +36,000 crore. The delivery centre is Karnal, Prasad said. ICEX expects 1 per cent of the Rs 36,000-crore physical market to use the price hedging on its platform in the first year.

{"title": "The countdown begins: Apple likely to launch credit card next month", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3289_News_0>Apple and Goldman Sachs’s hotly anticipated new credit card is now just weeks away from launch, according to a person familiar with the companies. The release will be the culmination of an intense, high-stakes development process for the Silicon Valley giant and the Wall Street stalwart.The Apple Card is targeted to launch as early as the first half of August. That timing means the project is on schedule for the summer release date that Apple first announced in March. People who own an iPhone will be able to sign up for the card via the Wallet app, which will have built-in Apple Card support as part of the latest iOS 12.4 update.The closely watched collaboration between Apple Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. represents one of the most ambitious ever attempted between an old-world finance titan and a tech company. It also involved the mixing of two very different corporate cultures as the companies split up responsibilities for the project and worked together on the new technology, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the process was private. <IMG Economictime_PL_3289_News_1> \"Apple is a great partner and we together are excited about delivering a product that we think customers will love,\" a Goldman Sachs spokesman said in a statement. Representatives for Apple declined to comment.In March, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and some of the bank’s highest-ranking executives visited Cupertino, California, to attend the much-anticipated announcement of the card. On stage, Tim Cook and Apple Pay executive Jennifer Bailey delivered the news with characteristic Apple fanfare.The outpouring of press coverage about the partnership helped Goldman Sachs bring attention to its efforts to make financial products for everyday people. While the bank has long been a Wall Street institution, it has only recently attempted to ramp up its new consumer-facing business. For Apple, the credit card is thought of as a way to bring in more recurring revenue from iPhone users and further enmesh them in its web of services.The companies divvied up responsibilities for developing and managing the project. Apple designed the card and will handle its software interface for iPhones. Goldman Sachs is responsible for the underlying infrastructure, managing payment disputes, handling transaction data and collating information for monthly statements.Goldman Sachs currently has dozens of people working on the product out of its Manhattan headquarters, plus other dedicated employees in satellite offices, said the people. The Apple side of the project is managed by the company’s Apple Pay and Wallet app teams. <IMG Economictime_PL_3289_News_2> At the time of the announcement, Solomon told employees that the partnership was “a major step in the growth of our consumer franchise,” and added that the bank’s lack of legacy credit card technology made it the “best partner” for the effort.In May, Apple expressed concern with the underlying technology Goldman Sachs had developed to power the credit card, according to people familiar with the discussions. At the time, Apple informed the bank that it was unhappy with some of the card’s mechanics and asked for changes. The pressure mounted on Goldman Sachs staffers as the card neared its planned launch date.The different viewpoints appear not to have derailed the card’s progress toward its summer release. Apple employees and retail workers have been testing the card for several weeks or more, depending on their role at the firm.In addition to its stark white appearance and digital-first design, the credit card aims to entice customers with no fees, deep iPhone integration, a unique system for tracking spending and a privacy-centric approach. The product has been designed to be used primarily via Apple Pay, rather than as a physical credit card. However, the company will also issue users an actual card for merchants that don’t accept Apple Pay.The Apple Card features a cash-back rewards structure instead of points, offering users 1% on purchases made with the physical card, 2% for Apple Pay transactions and 3% for purchases of Apple products or services.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/the-countdown-begins-apple-likely-to-launch-credit-card-next-month/articleshow/70395561.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3289_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The Apple Card features a cash-back rewards structure instead of points, offering users 1% on purchases made with the physical card, 2% for Apple Pay transactions and 3% for purchases of Apple products or services.

{"title": "Ratan Tata-backed ClimaCell launches minute-by-minute, hyper-local weather app in India", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3356_News_0>Boston-based weather technology firm ClimaCell, which has been backed by Ratan Tata, has launched its weather assistant app on Android and is also opening their Asia Pacific (APAC) office in India. Launched in 2019 on iOS, ClimaCell’s Weather Assistant has already generated just under 3000 ratings in the App store with an average rating of 4.6 stars out of 5. “40% of the people who downloaded the app have reported that it is now their go-to app for weather forecasting,” Nadav Itach, SVP & Managing Director of APAC office of ClimaCell told ET Digital. According to Itach, India represents a huge opportunity for ClimaCell. And while the firm is expecting a global growth by expanding to Android, it believes that one of the markets that will benefit is India as more than 90% of the phones in the country are on Android. “With a lack of hyper-local weather infrastructure in addition to a volatile climate and weather relient population, the demand for our weather-of-things approach will be beneficial to extensive audiences across a number of use cases including both consumer and business applications. This is why ClimaCell has decided to open an APAC office, with a branch in India,” he said. The Weather Assistant app provides real-time detailed forecasts and sends actionable alerts to users. For example, users will receive alerts such as “it will stop raining in Delhi’s Connaught Place in 17 minutes” or “it will start raining in 25 minutes in Mumbai’s Gateway of India”.Also, the app provides users the flexibility to connect to their calendars and get updates and alerts. Therefore, if one has to attend an outdoor event during the week and the weather forecasts call for drizzles of rain, the app will send an alert to the user and to all the attendees so changes can be made.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3356_News_1> “We initially built Weather Assistant because even though there are plenty of existing weather apps on the market people were still having trouble making decisions about their daily schedule or upcoming plans based on the weather. Weather Assistant solves the problem by integrating people’s schedules and activities with hyper-local weather forecasts so people can better plan ahead,” said Effie Arditi, Chief Product Officer at ClimaCell. Meanwhile, the weather technology firm also launched its APAC offices in New Delhi and Mumbai. According to Itach, the locations were selected in order to be “close to our customers in both commercial as well the governmental sector.”“When we started ClimaCell three years ago, the APAC region was an area of the world we were most excited to work with,” said Shimon Elkabetz, CEO of ClimaCell. With existing offices in Boston, Boulder, and Tel Aviv, the APAC office will support ClimaCell’s global expansion and existing demand in the region. The APAC team will be focused on developing and growing ClimaCell’s business, working closely with customers and strategic partners in the region. “The objectives of opening ClimaCell offices in India are sales, business development and customer service,” said Itach, who will be heading the offices.. When asked about the employee strength in the Indian APAC offices, Itach said, “We are currently expanding the team to support our growth in the Indian market. This will be built from industry experts with strong commercial and relevant technical background.”In other developments, ClimaCell, in January, announced a strategic collaboration with Google Cloud offering free access to high resolution weather forecasting models in geographies, including India, which currently do not possess the services. “The outputs will be made accessible through Google Cloud’s public dataset program. We have improved the forecasting resolution X5 in India,” he claimed, adding that ClimaCell’s models will be available to the public, including developers, scientists and business users alike. The ClimaCell Bespoke Atmospheric Model (CBAM) India, collaborating with Google Cloud platform, will be provided at 2 km resolution and 15-minute timestep, and will provide a 48-hour forecast.

{"title": "Skagen brings ‘Hygge-inspired’ fashion jewellery line; launches simple, minimalist designs for millennials", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3362_News_0>NEW DELHI: A muted festive season - that saw subdued consumer spending - has not deterred Skagen from going ahead and launching its jewellery line in India. Skagen, which is a part of the Fossil group, recently showcased its collection comprising minimalist design, in sync with the brand’s Scandinavian style and the very-Danish concept of “Hygge” that describes “how you feel in a moment that you want to last forever” for daily activities.As “Hygge” takes over Instagram feeds, and brings in its wake simple, non-flashy designs, Johnson Verghese, Vice President and Managing Director, Fossil India, feels that India is ready to change the way it looks at aesthetics when it comes to jewellery.  “I don't think there exists an equivalent brand in this space, and for us at Skagen, it’s a well-considered move. Our year-long background research and insights gathered from customers tell us that women are ready to buy this kind of jewellery,” Verghese says on the sidelines of the launch.With the price of gold hovering in the Rs 39,000 backet, he feels that “the time is right” for Skagen’s fashion jewellery to appropriate the space. <IMG Economictime_PL_3362_News_1> “Given the price of precious gold at where it is, it's probably high time that we have an alternative in place for fashion jewellery,” he adds.Simple bracelets with tiny studs, “tree of life” pendants in petite-looking chains, and non-flamboyant neckpieces - Skagen jewellery’s offering seems unconventional. But Anita Vogel, Brand Director, Skagen Denmark – Asia Pacific, is confident that it’s ideal for the working women in India. “Skagen for three decades has been creating watches and jewellery with the design principle of Hygge and minimalist design. The jewellery line in India is based on the Danish simplicity, capturing only what's truly essential in an uncomplicated, great-looking way,” she says.Skagen enjoys a formidable presence across the top nine metro cities that includes malls and standalone outlets where its main customer base remains. And the new jewellery line, being pitched as a “lifestyle product” resonates with its largely-urban consumers between the ages of 20-30, explains Verghese.“During our research, we found that young professionals in the 20-30 bracket needed jewellery that was an accessory, in sync with their cosmopolitan lifestyle. In Bangalore, we came across a large number of IT professionals - young people with disposable incomes, cosmopolitan outlook and balancing tradition and modern choices,” Verghese explains. For a millennial population, fed on Instagram filters and used to swiping right and being spoilt for choices, how does Skagen plan to command loyalty? “Skagen has an authentic brand story, and millennials have expressed desire to know its history and lineage, and the aspiration that it represents of the Scandinavian way of life. Being socially-conscious, they want to know if it’s sustainable, and we tick those boxes,” Vogel says with a smile. Sustainability apart, the brand knows that price is the other factor that will decide its recall. And that’s why, Verghese says, the pricing has been kept “pocket-friendly”.“The fashion jewellery line is priced between Rs 2500 and Rs 12000,” he adds.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/skagen-brings-hygge-inspired-fashion-jewellery-line-launches-simple-minimalist-designs-for-indian-woman/articleshow/72295186.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3362_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The new jewellery line, being pitched as a “lifestyle product” resonates with its largely-urban consumers between the ages of 20-30.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3362_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-72295328,width-650,imgsize-277592,,resizemode-4,quality-100/the-new-jewellery-line-being-pitched-as-a-lifestyle-product-resonates-with-its-largely-urban-consumers-between-the-ages-of-20-30-.jpg"}, {"caption": "Skagen enjoys a formidable presence across the top nine metro cities that includes malls and standalone outlets where its main customer base remains.

{"title": "FMCG cracks the Patanjali code, naturally", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3372_News_0>MUMBAI: Patanjali Ayurved disrupted the Indian fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector with nature-based products in various categories to challenge the dominance of companies such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in the past three-four years. That has forced rivals, especially the multinationals, to retool their portfolios to introduce matching products at similar price points to try and regain their market ranking, analysts said. This seems to be paying off, they said.The homegrown upstart has been most successful in staples such as ghee, flour, ayurvedic health supplements, toothpaste, edible oil and condiments but less so in noodles, biscuits, personal care, chocolates and juices.Its rapid growth posed a threat to mainstream FMCG companies by renewing the natural/herbal/ayurvedic theme and compelling FMCG companies to tweak their range. For instance, HUL’s personal care products faced headwinds, prompting the company to relaunch its Ayush brand and acquire ayurvedic hair oil brand Indulekha. Having sustained similar damage in the oral care segment, Colgate-Palmolive launched its own herbal toothpaste. <IMG Economictime_PL_3372_News_1> The Patanjali effect on Colgate-Palmolive is waning, possibly due to distribution and supply chain issues apart from the fading novelty of its products, according to JPMorgan’s report this month on the FMCG sector by Latika Chopra and Sushruta Mishra.While hurting FMCG companies in the short term, Patanjali predominantly gained market share in commoditised categories made up of unorganised players.‘COMPANY CAN TROUBLE UNORGANISED PLAYERS’Competitive intensity has faded in the organised end since Patanjali’s products no longer have the unique selling proposition (USP) of being natural with other brands having entered the market at similar or lower price points, experts said.“The threat has receded but it is more of a case of Patanjali having lost the plot,” said Milind Sarwate, former CFO of Marico and now an independent director on several boards. “They tried too many things. They have not looked at their growing in scale at the back end. They succeeded in demand creation but not in demand fulfilment. They fell short of the institutional strength to sustain the rising volume. Their threat is definitely lower because they had internal issues — supply not being on time, trade not happy with them.”Patanjali is diversifying into new categories such as garments and education. It’s also in the fray to acquire Ruchi Soya, a large player in the commoditised industry of solvent extraction or edible oils.Analysts say that the company is likely to pose more of a threat to the unorganised sector going forward.“Even if Patanjali is able to overcome its recent issues on quality and supply chain, we expect it to gain market share in these commoditised categories at the expense of unorganised players, and not pose a major threat to the listed F&B companies playing in non-commoditised categories,” said the food and beverage report released by Systematix Investments earlier this month. Still, Patanjali retains the ability to create further disruption, said Sarwate.“Patanjali cannot be ignored by the market leaders — they are capable of a surprise,” he said. “I expect them to do something dramatic like giving 30% discount on their products or so.”The JPMorgan report says there is a downside risk for Dabur’s growth prospects due to the overlap of categories with Patanjali such as chyawanprash, honey, hair oil and toothpaste.Based on ETIG data, Nestle and Britannia have outperformed on the ground as well as on the bourses, despite competition from Patanjali. Dabur also has managed to keep improving its performance amid competitive intensity.HUL’s market share in soaps has been resilient even after the entry of Patanjali, according to the latest report by Reliance Securities.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/fmcg-cracks-the-patanjali-code-naturally/articleshow/68589423.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3372_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Competitive intensity has faded in the organised end since Patanjali’s products no longer have the USP of being natural with other brands having entered the market at similar or lower price points, experts said.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3372_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68589438,width-300,imgsize-584829,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_3372_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-68589455,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Menstruation products: How a movement was created by women for women", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_0>It matters. Period.” When 26-year-old firstgen entrepreneur Tanvi Johri came up with this tagline for her premium, 100% natural and biodegradable sanitary napkins, Carmesi, the inspiration came from within. For years, Johri had struggled with painful periods. Skin rashes were a recurring problem, caused by the plastic sanitary napkins that she used and what were commonly available. By the time she was 22, and nearly a decade or so into her menstruating life, she decided to take stock. “I had tried various products, soft and plastic, to manage my periods. But the discomfort was universal. Then, four years ago, while interning at a startup, I decided to research on organic pads.” In May 2017, Johri designed a sanitary pad made up of cornstarch and bamboo. In November 2017, she and friend Rikshav Bohra launched the product. “We first used our savings. Then we got seed funding from a group of angel investors, including Sunil Kalra and Arun Venkatachalam from the Murugappa Group.” It has been a thrill ride for Johri. “Women write to us with their user experiences. So many of them have shared stories of discomfort, rashes and allergies they have suffered due to conventional pads.”  <IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_1> Carmesi made a revenue of Rs 1 crore last year and is targeting Rs 7-8 crore this year. This cannot be compared with the Indian sanitary napkin market’s 2017 valuation of $441 million, according to market researcher IMARC. But the fact remains that period product options for Indian women — which have largely been either pads or tampons — is increasing. The growing conversation around menstruation, the fight for an exemption from the goods and services tax (which just came through), and period-positive movements — a lot after the movie Pad Man — have made sure companies don’t ignore the need for innovative, functional and accessible sanitary products.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_2> In short, a new-wave femcare is coming up with products largely designed and made by women for women. The focus here is on bodysafe, eco-friendly menstrual hygiene solutions. Sample this: Companies like EcoFemme makes reusable cloth pads, while Saathi and Purganics make 100% biodegradable pads. Adira and Clovia offer period panties. Shecup, Boondh Cup, Silky Cup are trying to get women to use menstrual cups. Bengaluru-based Bharti Kannan of social enterprise Boondh found out about menstrual cups in 2011; she was, as a student of Tata Institute of Social Sciences specialising in gender studies and public health, researching on ways to manage periods. She and Sonal Jain, who operates out of Chennai, have been promoting Boondh cups through social media initiatives and their menstrual hygiene workshops. The cups, produced in China, retail at Rs 590. From selling 70-80 cups a month in 2016, it now manages to sell 700.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_3> Unlike pads, menstrual cups are made of medical-grade silicone and fit right inside the vaginal canal, and collect the blood. The cups can be cleaned easily and reused. The product lasts for 4-5 years and is environment friendly. “Yet, in a country of 300 million menstruating women, only 30,000-40,000 use cups. We have not even scratched the surface yet,” Kannan says. The lack of awareness might have a lot to do with social and cultural issues, too. “Could be due to one of all of the following,” says Ashish Malani of Mumbai-based Shecup, “lack of information or access, a pad-heavy mindset, or the fact that physical insertion is considered a no-no for unmarried women.” Malani, along with his brother Manish, entered the market commercially in 2010 with menstrual cup maker Shecup, after they lost a close relative to cervical cancer because of unhygienic practices. Manish, a medical equipment professional, decided to import cost-effective cervical diagnostics kits. When that didn’t take off, the brothers researched hygienic menstrual products and decided on the cup for their self-funded venture.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_4> To avoid “medico-legal issues”, Malani had to create a gynaecological prototype and approach doctors for certification. Words like insertion or implant couldn’t be used, as they knew it would face immediate rejection. “We built a base slowly, through workshops with corporates and with NGOs. Even so, the big companies used to ask if we had ‘ladies’ to hold the workshops,” he adds. But that situation has changed in 10 years. Malani, who works as an accountant apart from running the social enterprise, says, “We have seen a jump in our sales in the last two years. About 500-600 units sell every month as opposed to 50-60 earlier.” What needs to improve is the level of education. The educated urban woman is as clueless and period-shy as her rural counterpart, Malani says. “Ignorance and shame are across the board — at all settings. Our 30-minute corporate sessions have often run into well over two hours as women have so many questions about their own bodies.”  <IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_5> This does not surprise social entrepreneur and cofounder of Ahmedabad-based Menstrupedia, Aditi Gupta, who has been fighting for creating a period-positive narrative for six years. She and her partner Tuhin Paul has created a multi-channel educational resource on menstruation which includes web, comic book and audio visual aid. “Even in schools, the reproductive chapter is often skipped or covered in a hurry. A study has found that 3 out of 10 girls don’t even know what menstruation is at the time of their first period,” she says. The idea behind Gupta’s venture — the Menstrupedia Comic — was to be able to discuss menstruation in a non-threatening way and without the shame. The comic has reached more than 50 million users through online and offline efforts. Four state governments have adopted the comic and 250-plus schools in India use these books. It has been translated to 11 regional languages and 4 foreign languages (Spanish, Nepali, Bulgarian, Russian and Portuguese). But all these are only a mere drop in the ocean, says Gupta. “The myths and myth creation around menstruation and a woman’s growing body is enormous and has to be chipped away slowly. Thankfully, conversations around period-positivity are catching up and there’s a zeal to explore alternative period management.” A cup user herself, Gupta says period management can’t be a fight of products.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_6> “Sustainable is the way of the future. But the burden of the environment can’t be placed on the shoulders of a 13-year-old menstruating girl,” she says. Gupta wants to create an informative guide for boys on their puberty, and also to encourage healthy conversations about sex. Conversations are required to change the mindset, says Bengaluru-based entrepreneur Deepa Kumar. “Not cocktail conversations or ‘trying to trend’ talks, but healthy discussions.” In 2008, Kumar invented the period panty and started online sales through MyAdira.com. She holds a patent in the US for the product. The self-funded venture sells 5,000 units a month. A period panty is a fortified underwear with leak-stops for better stain protection. It is not a substitute for a pad. “Haven’t we all have asked friends to check for stains when we get up or avoided wearing white during our cycle,” Kumar asks.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3376_News_7> This shame is what she wants to erase. The mother of two daughters says early puberty experiences can set the course of a girl’s personality. “Her self-esteem and self-worth can all be affected by the experiences in these formative years.” The cofounder of lingerie brand Clovia, Neha Kant, wants to go a step further. After all, she says, innerwear has to match the advancements in outerwear. Kant and Suman Chowdhury, who heads product design, founded Clovia in 2015. They decided to launch their first range of period panties in February of that year. “The insight was from a young gaggle of design interns who talked of a product to help them manage the fear of getting stains,” she says. Through an online exercise, they decided to not make the products in boring old colours. So came panties with a character, and sporting slogans such as “Not today. Period”, “Dear uterus, f@3k off ” or “I scream, Ice cream”. Kant says women wrote in thanking them “for making periods fun”. The products, retailing at 3 for Rs 599, were sold out in under three months. “More people are talking about menstruation as more women and girls are now as active during their periods as every other day. There was always an inherent need that was not addressed. Now these needs are getting addressed, and mostly by women, as the problem is intrinsic to us and we understand it better,” adds Kumar of MyAdira.com.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/miscellaneous/menstruation-products-how-a-movement-was-created-by-women-for-women/articleshow/65273942.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The growing conversation around menstruation and period-positive movements — a lot after the movie Pad Man — have made sure companies don’t ignore the need for innovative, functional and accessible sanitary products.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-65274279,width-300,imgsize-42057,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-13.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-14", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65274362,quality-100/untitled-14.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-15", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65274363,quality-100/untitled-15.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-16", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65274370,quality-100/untitled-16.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-17", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65274377,quality-100/untitled-17.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-18", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_5", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65274380,quality-100/untitled-18.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-20", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_6", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65274385,quality-100/untitled-20.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-21", "id": "Economictime_PL_3376_News_7", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65274388,quality-100/untitled-21.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Apple fails to establish foothold in market share, local production and retail presence in India", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3381_News_0>Two years ago, when Apple chief executive Tim Cook met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India’s message was clear: Tell us what’s needed to promote local manufacturing and we will do it.The Cupertino, California-based company, though, has since realised that the government won’t tailor rules for one company, and that the PM simply meant ease of doing business. Now, Apple is looking for a Plan B in a country that not only offers volumes but has the potential to be a manufacturing base in the backdrop of US-China trade tensions.The circumstances are not happy for the phone maker. Already hit by a longer replacement cycle for its phones the world over, Apple has been struggling to sell in India, a market that has a plethora of less expensive, but equally featurerich options, from Chinese players.Last year, Apple took things into its own hands. Veteran Michel Coulomb got charge of India operations with clear directions to clean up the mess — stop rampant deep discounts that were hurting the brand and leading to price fluctuations, and conjure up a new India strategy. <IMG Economictime_PL_3381_News_1> What followed was high-profile exits, downsizing of distributors, trimming of channels and tighter price control, which led sales to plummet and made 2018 a four-year nadir for the company. Even the new India strategy didn’t quite take off in 2018.In January, Ashish Chowdhary assumed charge of India operations, but ET’s interaction with key stakeholders still throws up a grim outlook for Apple in 2019.Industry watchers feel Apple needs a radical change with a two-pronged approach — strengthen music and video services, possibly even through acquisitions, and prepare grounds for making India a manufacturing hub, not just for the domestic market but more importantly, for exports.“Let me say it in bold words,” says Navkender Singh, associate research director, IDC. “India is not a priority market right now for products sale for Apple, but yes, for manufacturing, it could be a very important one.”Apple had a 1.2% market share in India at the end of 2018, with sales halving to almost 1.7 million units, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research.The iPhone maker made no mention of India while reporting October-December results. But in a response to ET’s queries, which came after repeated reminders over three weeks, Apple said it had a long-term perspective in India, which is already at the heart of its app development programme, through its App Accelerator. “Overall, more than 740,000 jobs in India can be attributed directly to the iOS ecosystem,” it says.It’s not enough, say insiders and experts, with the brand failing to establish a foothold in the big three areas of device market share, local production and retail presence, with services being close to zero.A DISSERVICE TO SERVICESExperts point out that at a time when the worldwide over-the-top (OTT) content market — music and video on demand — has exploded, a handset priced at $1,000 may not find takers in India, but subscription-based content on demand could transcend the price barrier.“Over the last two to three years, India has evolved into an OTT content delivery-based model, which has seen the entry of a lot of international players as well,” says Prashant Singhal, global head for telecom, media and technology, EY.Small wonder then, that Apple is among those exploring the acquisition of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), along with US major Comcast and Sony Corp among others as reported by ET.On a global scale, Apple is a latecomer to this party. The company is expected to release its original content in the latter half of 2019 and, according to a recent announcement, iTunes will now be available on Samsung TV sets, a perfect opportunity in a non-iOS market like India.It could similarly have priced some niche content higher and announced partnerships across different operating systems. Reports suggest Apple may undercut Netflix.Gaurav Gandhi, country manager, video, Amazon Prime, says it typically takes two years for a conception to come live on screen. “We have invested significantly in local content and we are working on newer shows in seven new languages,” he adds. In a space where Netflix, Voot, Hotstar, HOOQ and Amazon jostle for room, Apple remains years behind.The company says Apple Music has made inroads into the Indian music streaming space, with a focus on in-country talent. Earlier this month, it launched Apple Maps navigation for India. The phone maker does not, however, seem to be in a hurry to launch Apple Pay in India at a time when all and sundry — including the likes of Google Pay and WhatsApp — have moved into the surging digital payments market.PRODUCTION, THE BEST OPTIONThe big push, though, is production. Apple is the world’s largest electronics manufacturer and second-largest overall manufacturer after Volkswagen AG. Apple makes almost all of its $200-billion worth of products — iPhones, iPads, laptops and wearables — out of China. To put it in perspective, India’s total exports were about $300 billion in 2017-18.Industry experts believe India has huge potential as the next manufacturing hub for Apple, especially coupled with China-US geopolitical pressures. However, some believe gains will be symbiotic. “Frankly, this seems to be more of a miss for the Indian government, than the other way round,” says Vivan Sharan, partner, Koan Advisory, a public policy advisory which has Netflix and Amazon as its clients.Contrary to media reports, Sharan says Apple has not put in any application with the government for company-specific concessions since 2017. “After Cook’s visit, Apple had made a proposal to the government, which became redundant once the Phased Manufacturing Plan came into effect. The company has not placed any fresh proposal in the last two years, to the best of our knowledge,” he adds.Meanwhile, the India Cellular & Electronics Association has sought a 10-year tax holiday, much like in China and Vietnam, along with change in labour and ewaste laws, to attract global giants. Apple, along with Vivo, Oppo, Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi, is a member of ICEA.According to a McKinsey study, the move would “fire up” manufacturing, creating a $230-billion industry by 2025 and generating 4.7 million jobs. “This was a huge opportunity for the government but nothing seems to be moving on this front,” adds Sharan.RETAIL TAILS OFFApple began assembling the iPhone SE in 2016 through Wistron in Bengaluru and expanded operations to include the iPhone 6s in 2018. Wistron has applied for the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), notified to attract investments in electronic manufacturing, to invest Rs 5,000 crore over five years and begin manufacturing iPhone 8 too.However, insiders say it’s still a long way away, given the lack of cutting-edge ecosystem in India.Plans for a bigger retail presence have also not made much headway, but it might not be Apple’s fault entirely, with the government sitting on its proposal for almost three years.Three years ago, the clause requiring 30% mandatory local sourcing for foreign players to open single-brand retail stores was relaxed, provided they had state-ofthe-art (the SOTA category) facilities. “Apple, along with other high-tech companies, queued up at the government’s door,” a person in the know of Apple’s application tells ET, not wishing to be identified. “Not a single company has received approval so far.”Apple is now believed to be planning half a dozen 5,000-sq ft, franchisee-operated Flagship Apple Premium Reseller outlets this year, three each in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, sources tell ET. It’s a piecemeal effort. As Mahesh Uppal, an independent telecom policy analyst, says, “Right now, policymakers are unlikely to take any bold, or let us say significant, decisions since there is an air of uncertainty, which is typical of an election year.”Another year may just go down in Apple’s not-so-glorious India story by the time the new government comes in and policy-making resumes in full swing.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/apple-fails-to-establish-foothold-in-market-share-local-production-and-retail-presence-in-india/articleshow/68072349.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3381_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3381_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68072349,width-650,imgsize-477030,,resizemode-4,quality-100/.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_3381_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-68072353,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Maruti’s diesel models going out with a bang ahead of BS-VI launch", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3384_News_0>MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki is witnessing a sudden surge in demand for its diesel models, compelling the maker of the Vitara Brezza and Dzire to ramp up production of some of the variants that it plans to phase out before the new emission standards come into effect in April.Huge discounts and extended warranty that the company is offering to clear the inventory of Bharat Stage-IV variants have attracted consumers looking for value buys.In the past couple of months, retail sales of the Vitara Brezza diesel almost doubled to 13,000-14,000 units from the previous months.The company has now extended the production of Brezza’s diesel variants by a month to January, and increased the planned output by 3,000-4,000 units each in November and December to about 12,000 units. <IMG Economictime_PL_3384_News_1> In fact, including other models, the local subsidiary of Japan’s Suzuki Motor will be producing around 30,000 units of diesel vehicles in the next three months, which is almost 30-50% higher than its previous plan. The company has hired back close to 1,000 temporary workers it had previously let go of as the diesel variants of the Brezza and Dzire Tour, and other models like the new WagonR, S-Presso and XL6 have a waiting period for delivery.Maruti Suzuki didn’t respond to an email seeking comment until press time Monday.The company has already started manufacturing vehicles conforming to the upcoming Bharat State-VI emission standards. It is now also producing petrol variants of the Brezza, which was previously available only in diesel. Maruti Suzuki had earlier said that it would discontinue production of diesel vehicles once the new rules come into effect, citing cost.A few other automakers, too, have said that they would rethink on their diesel strategy, since the high cost of developing the engines won’t make those viable on small cars.Toyota’s diesel plans Toyota, which operates in the Indian market through a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group, is among the automakers looking at stopping the production of small diesel vehicles in the country, said industry insiders.While Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) will continue to offer diesel options in utility vehicles Innova and Fortuner, it will discontinue the 1.3-litre diesel engine currently strapped on the Etios, Etios Cross, Liva and the Corolla Altis, they said.Diesel vehicles currently account for 85% of the volume for the company, for which more than 60% of the sales comes from the Innova and Fortuner. N Raja, the deputy managing director at TKM, said the company continued to see demand for diesel.“We will continue to be in diesel as long there is a demand from the customers and the next technology innovations begins,” he said in response to ET’s questions.Prices of diesel vehicles are likely to increase 15-20% due to the implementation of BS-VI, TKM said.Smooth transition Maruti Suzuki has already moved to BS-VI from BS-IV for as many as eight models, as the company is aiming for a smooth transition and avoiding a fire sale ahead of the March 31 deadline.Diesel-powered vehicles accounted for 22% of the total volume for the company in the September quarter, compared with 33% for the industry. The company offered an average discount of Rs. 1.10 lakh on its diesel models in three-month period.That was more than four times the overall discount of Rs. 25,761per vehicle it offered in the quarter. The reason for the sudden spike in demand for Maruti Suzuki’s diesel models is the enhanced value proposition it offered with the extended warranty and steep discount, said Gaurav Vangaal, the country lead for production forecasting at IHS Markit.“Post BS-VI, with a steep price hike, the diesel demand is likely to fall significantly,” he added.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/marutis-diesel-models-going-out-with-a-bang-ahead-of-bs-vi-launch/articleshow/72118254.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3384_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3384_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-72118249,width-300,imgsize-849174,,resizemode-4,quality-100/vitara-brezza-bccl.jpg"}, {"caption": "19nov graph 2", "id": "Economictime_PL_3384_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-72118322,quality-100/19nov-graph-2.jpg"}]}

Incidentally, it will be the lone ‘only foods’ company in the index.The company’s turnaround under Varun Berry, who was appointed as its head in 2013, ensured that it performed well in its key food segments, creating Rs 68,000 crore of wealth for investors since.The management drove profitable growth through launch of new food categories, growing its dairy business, foray into international markets, achieving cost efficiency, gaining distribution momentum and increasing innovation.In the past five fiscals, Britannia’s net sales have increased at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10 per cent - higher than its other three peers. Its net profit swelled at a CAGR of 31 per cent - double the rate of increase posted by its peers Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) and Marico. <IMG Economictime_PL_3393_News_1> The mid-sized company outperformed its peers GCPL, Dabur and Marico in its performance on the ground as well as on the bourses to gain an entry into the Nifty.While Britannia and GCPL are similar on some counts (similar revenues and market cap), Britannia has an edge over GCPL. It has a higher return on capital employed and a higher free float.GCPL, on the other hand, has better operating margin profile, but lower returns on capital employed and lower valuations. Its stock remained flat over the past year even as ET FMCG Index rose 14 per cent and the Britannia stock surged 29 per cent. Little wonder then that over half of the analysts tracking Britannia’s stock are bullish on it, this proportion stands at 28 per cent in case of GCPL.In March 2014, Britannia was the least valuable of the stocks among its peers (GCPL, Dabur, Marico and Emami) and today it is the most valuable FMCG stock. Trading at 67 times its trailing four quarter earnings, its stretched valuations have rather been a concern lately for the stock. Inclusion in Nifty will further attract buying from index funds and is a long term positive for the Britannia stock.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-britannia-edged-out-its-peers-to-enter-nifty50/articleshow/68385244.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3393_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In March 2014, Britannia was the least valuable of the stocks among its peers (GCPL, Dabur, Marico and Emami) and today it is the most valuable FMCG stock.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3393_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68385245,width-210,imgsize-139332,,resizemode-4,quality-100/rise-gain-1-getty.jpg"}, {"caption": "Britannia snip 1", "id": "Economictime_PL_3393_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-68385228,quality-100/britannia-snip-1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "New budget wireless audio products to buy", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3394_News_0>A number of Chinese and Indian brands are now offering Bluetooth headphones and speakers at unbelievably low prices. ET Wealth reviews a few recent launches.BLUETOOTH SPEAKERSPortronics Breeze : Rs 2,999The Portronics Breeze has an IPx6 water resistant body. The cylindrical speaker has large buttons on top for ease of use and weighs just 420 grams. It has 2x4W speakers which deliver audio loud enough for a medium-sized room, and even has a decent amount of bass. You can connect with it wirelessly over Bluetooth or using an aux-cable. It also has a microSD slot. The speaker has a built-in mic for taking voice calls. We were able to get just over four hours of battery life, which is good considering its size.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3394_News_1>  The highlight is that you can pair two Portronics Breeze speakers and use them as stereo speakers.Toreto Twin Magno : Rs 5,999 <IMG Economictime_PL_3394_News_2>  We were able to get just over six hours of battery life from each speaker, which is fantastic. It comes with a faux leather casing to protect the wooden finish.BLUETOOTH HEADPHONESZakk Firefly : Rs 1,499    The Firefly stands out because of its LED wire, which can be set to glow in three modes–always on, steady flash and quick flash. The headphones are also sweat and dust resistant. We liked the ear-hook design which prevents the headphones from falling off, but they are not comfortable to use for long hours. It also has noise reduction, which allows for a more immersive experience. However, while the volume level of the headphones is fantastic, it suffers from muddled bass. Other issues include shrill audio at max volume and lack of sync when using the headphones for YouTube. In our usage, we got battery life of over six hours regularly, which is good for the price.Mivi Conquer : Rs 3,299    Mivi is an Indian brand mainly known for its power products. The Conquer is their latest offering in the wireless headphones segment. The headphones have excellent build quality and a stylish finish. The lightweight design with earhooks is comfortable to wear for long hours. Audio quality is also impressive– loud volume level, crisp vocals and excellent treble. However, do not expect thumping bass from this one. You can connect the conquer to two devices simultaneously and it also has a mic on in-line controls for voice calls. We regularly managed to get over nine hours of battery life. The only issue is that there is no way to hold them around the neck when not in use.Tagg Sports Plus : Rs 3,499    This Tagg wireless headphones looks and feels much more premium than its price. It has braided cable and the earbuds have a nanocoating for protection from sweat and water splashes.The earpieces have a compact and ergonomic design which is comfortable to wear for long hours. They also have magnets at the end, which allows you to wear them around the neck without worrying about losing them. Audio quality is a mixed bag. While we loved the volume level and crisp vocals the bass felt lacking. The built-in mic works well for voice calls even in noisy environments. On a single charge, we were able to get over seven hours of battery life, which is great. It also comes with a sleek carry case.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/spend/new-budget-wireless-audio-products-to-buy/articleshow/62766336.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3394_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Zakk Firefly also has noise reduction, which allows for a more immersive experience.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3394_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-62766382,width-300,imgsize-61994,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-12.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-279", "id": "Economictime_PL_3394_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62768426,quality-100/untitled-279.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-88", "id": "Economictime_PL_3394_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62768459,quality-100/untitled-88.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Logitech MX Master 2S mouse review: When productivity & performance matter", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3405_News_0>         Logitech MX Master 2S mouse Rs 8,995Logitech MX series has been well known for its performance-oriented computer mouse. Out of their product range, the MX Master which was launched in 2015, has been one of our favorite owing to its design as well as feature set. Now, a successor to the MX Master has been launched with the MX Master 2S. The Master 2S feature with all the stuff we loved on the original plus comes with the new Flow feature for multi-device use.In terms of design, the Master 2S is identical to the Master in terms of shape, size and even the placement of various buttons. We loved the comfort and grip it offers, plus the buttons are easily accessible for use. However, it is still meant only for right handed users. There is a scroll wheel on top which adapts to your use – you can scroll click-to-click and when you want to scroll fast it automatically switches to hyper fast scroll. The side mounted scroll doesn’t have the same functionality. All the buttons have a nice click feel to them and are not hard to press – this helps in productivity as you are able to have a number of functions available on your finger tips for quick access.It uses Logitech’s Darkfield technology – it worked without any issue on a table, a cloth and even on a reflective glass surface. Plus, the mouse now has 4000 dpi: so you can use it for gaming on your full HD or 4k monitor without worrying about any delays or slow drag movement even in FPS games. What helps in getting the most from the MX Master 2S is its unique software. Once you install the control software (Logitech Options), you can customize the buttons and scroll wheel to functions of your choice quickly. Moreover, you can even create custom settings for the mouse buttons for specific applications – you can have the side button do one function in general and a different function in Adobe Photoshop. <IMG Economictime_PL_3405_News_1> The big addition to the Master 2S is the Flow feature. Flow is logitech’s software feature that lets you control multiple devices (three at a time) using a single mouse. You can switch between devices by just moving your pointer to the edge of the screen plus as long as the devices are on the same WiFi, you can transfer files between them via a simple copy/paste function. We used the Flow system with a MacBook Air and a Windows desktop computer – it worked seamlessly without a hitch.We also liked that the Master 2S gives you the option to configure the mouse to one computer using Bluetooth and the other with the Unifying receiver included in the box. There is a tiny button at the bottom using which you can switch between three connected computers when required. Another feature that impressed us was the battery life of the mouse. Logitech claims up to 70 days on a single charge – even if you get 45 days of usage on a single charge, that is fantastic in our opinion. Plus, for emergency, a 3-minute charge will give you one full day of usage. The good thing is that you don’t have to carry an extra charger for the mouse as it uses micro USB port to charge and has battery level indicator LED on the side for notification.Overall, in our opinion, the MX Master 2S is a fantastic option for anyone looking at a performance oriented wireless mouse. At the time of writing, the mouse is available for Rs 6,799 which makes it a great deal.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/logitech-mx-master-2s-mouse-review-when-productivity-performance-matter/articleshow/67832534.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3405_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3405_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67832592,width-650,imgsize-354998,,resizemode-4,quality-100/logitech-mx-master-2s-mouse-review-when-productivity-performance-matter.jpg"}, {"caption": "Logitech MX Master 2S mouse review: When productivity & performance matter", "id": "Economictime_PL_3405_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67832603,quality-100/logitech-mx-master-2s-mouse-review-when-productivity-performance-matter.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Ola to launch self-drive service, to invest $500 million", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3411_News_0>BENGALURU: Homegrown ride-hailing platform Ola will invest over $500 million to launch a ‘self-drive’ service aimed at broadening its portfolio of transportation solutions, according to two people directly aware of the company’s plans.The investment will come from a mix of debt and equity over the next couple of years, according to one of the persons. Ola will deploy nearly 10,000 vehicles, including luxury sedans and SUVs, in major cities in coming months, said the person.Confirming the plans to test a self-drive offering, an Ola representative said, “Basis market feedback, we will pilot (the service) in various formats such as rentals, subscription and corporate leasing in select cities in the coming weeks.”People aware of the company’s plans told ET that Ola was likely to raise debt via Ola Fleet Technologies to seed the new business. So far, the multi-modal transport company has relied on equity capital from some of the world’s largest investors, including Japan’s SoftBank and US investment firm Tiger Global, to fund its rapid growth in the country.The Bengaluru-based company, which has raised $3.67 billion till date, was valued at roughly $6 billion during a funding round in February. Subscription ProductsEarlier this month, Ola, which competes with American ride-hailing major Uber in India, said it had raised $300 million from Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, as it looks to collaborate with the South Korean auto majors to build India-specific mobility solutions.“The (self-drive car rental service) will be launched in the coming weeks with a focus on top 5-7 markets,” a company executive told ET. <IMG Economictime_PL_3411_News_1> The scale of the proposed service will make Ola the largest self-drive car rental company in India. At present, the sector is highly fragmented with small regional players and some larger players including Myles, Sequoia Capital-backed Zoomcar, and Y Combinator-backed Drivezy.With the self-drive business, the intent is to build subscription products for consumers and leasing services for corporate executives through the Ola Corporate offering, said one of the persons quoted above. The move to enter the self-drive rental category is in line with Ola’s broader strategy of expanding its bouquet of transport solutions beyond just cabs to include scooters and electric vehicles with a view towards ensuring sustainability and positive unit economics. In the last few years, the company has launched a slew of businesses that generate higher margins such as outstation rentals.Last year, Ola started making money on each cab ride — a major milestone — after taking into account expenses such as driver incentives and customer discounts.Experts are of the view that more commuters will choose from shared, self-drive rentals or subscription-based mobility options, rather than bothering with car ownership. However, self-drive car rental services should have flexible hiring options, ranging from hours to days, and be available 24×7 through mobile applications, they said.“They need to be far more affordable than they are now and offer local support with an ecosystem of convenient pick-up and drop-off points,” said Vinay Piparsania, consulting director at Counterpoint Research.In February, Ola confirmed a Rs 650-crore funding from Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal. Steadview Capital and a cohort of US-based investors like Raymond S Cahnman, chairman of Transmarket Group, philanthropists Tina and Steven Price, J3T Ventures and Lyon Assets along with a bunch of Chinese funds also participated in the company's latest round.Separately, the company’s electric mobility arm raised Rs 400 crore from Matrix Partners India and Tiger Global, among other investors.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/ola-to-go-on-a-self-drive-trip-with-500-million-in-boot/articleshow/68606909.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3411_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The move to enter the self-drive rental category is in line with Ola’s broader strategy of expanding its bouquet of transport solutions beyond just cabs to include scooters and electric vehicles with a view towards ensuring sustainability and positive unit economics.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3411_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68607039,width-300,imgsize-554470,,resizemode-4,quality-100/self-drive-car.jpg"}, {"caption": "ola-car", "id": "Economictime_PL_3411_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-68607145,quality-100/ola-car.jpg"}]}

Base metal prices in the past one year has witnessed volatility because of the US-China tariff war. BSE has already launched a delivery-based copper futures contract in India. “The increased volatility in the base metals complex due to escalations in US-China trade war and weak macro-economic data from China have led to increased need for hedging of risk by market participants.

{"title": "India is slowly catching up with the world to use 3D printing in building products", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3504_News_0>Agnikul Cosmos, incubated at IIT-Madras, is looking to become the country’s first private on-demand rocket company. The startup has a design for a semi-cryogenic rocket with a 20-kilonewton (KN) engine that can potentially hurl satellites weighing up to 100 kg into lower earth orbit. To become an Uber of rockets, it is taking an unconventional approach. It plans to 3D print rocket engines.Whenever there is demand from customers to carry small satellites into space, it can 3D print the engine and assemble it in a rocket and launch them to space. In three years, Agnikul hopes to bring down the cost of access to space significantly and looks to capture a slice of the growing market for launching small satellites. It is up against intense competition globally, but CEO Srinath Ravichandran says it is worth the challenge.“Can we take a 1980s’ product and build it for the 21st century? As opposed to engines and tanks that go to orbit, we want to take a relook at the product with electronics and software, and build a smart vehicle that can go to orbit,” says 33-year-old Ravichandran, cofounder of the year-old Agnikul that has been shortlisted by European aerospace company Airbus for its incubator programme. “The key is flexible configuration with quality so we are able to launch on demand. We can build an engine in one or two days. Cost is a big differentiator and we can do this from India.”In conventional rockets, the engine is assembled by cutting metal and forged based on specifications. There is wastage of metal and the process is long-drawn. It takes time to build a rocket— say around 45 days for the country’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is already building a smaller rocket that can be assembled once in three days. It plans to test this next year.Ravichandran says there is an opportunity for Agnikul to complement Isro’s strengths. Today, there is a global race by private companies to hurl thousands of small satellites, some as light as 1 kg, called nanosatellites, for applications such as internet access, navigation and weather monitoring. SpaceWorks, a US satellite researcher, estimates over 2,600 nano and microsatellites will be launched by 2023. The latest forecast says nearly 60% of the satellites planned are from private players, as against 40% in the five years to 2016.While Agnikul is talking about the future, Isro has already taken baby steps in using 3D-printed components for its spacecraft. Its GSAT-19 satellite carried a component called a feed cluster into space two years ago. Wipro 3D, a unit of Wipro Infrastructure, which worked on the component, says India is slowly emerging as a player in application engineering for 3D-printed components and systems. It is already building other aerospace components for India, including a thruster for a satellite engine. 3D printing as a concept is not new. <IMG Economictime_PL_3504_News_1> For decades, companies used additive manufacturing to make prototypes of parts and systems in industries such as automobile to validate designs before beginning full-scale manufacturing. However, with the cost of electronics coming down and 3D printer sizes becoming smaller, there has been massive adoption of plastic 3D printing. However, metal 3D printing is still evolving. In aerospace, the global adoption is around a decade old.GE, which makes aerospace engines, first began using 3D printing to make components for passenger engines. This year, GE tested a full-fledged turboprop engine using 3D-printed parts. The move helped it reduce the weight of the engine by 45 kg, reduce the total number of moving parts to 12 from over 800, and improve engine efficiency by over 10%. In India, Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE), which is developing the Kaveri engine, 3D printed a plastic replica of the engine model and is exploring making components using additive technology.But adoption of 3D printing in the aerospace sector in the country has been slower. In 2015, consulting firm 6Wresearch estimated that the Indian 3D-printer market will reach $79 million by 2021. It added that medical, aerospace and military applications showed promising growth in the country. Yet, India has been late in full-scale adoption of 3D printing in the aerospace sector.Team Indus, which was looking to send a rover to the moon, built the wheels using 3D printing, bringing downtime to build and lowering the cost of the rover. Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has begun 3D printing components for 25 KN engine after one of its component vendors delayed supply. It is also working on systems for an unmanned aerial vehicle. Isro’s efforts are still nascent but are expected to grow significantly. “If we want to embark larger adoption of 3D printing 7-8 years from now, we have to address it today,” said Dr PV Venkitakrishnan, director, capability building programme office, at Isro. “We have to work with the industry to build capability to meet our demand.”So far, Isro has begun using 3D-printed components in spacecraft in small volumes. The industry has to mature to meet its demand for more complex components like in rockets. Units across Isro—in satellite making, deep space missions, and rocket labs—are actively looking at using 3D-printed products. “They not only have to meet the qualification for space applications. It has to be economical that competes in costs with our current process,” said Venkitakrishnan. He added that there are organisations with individual strengths such as in design, process, making the right alloy, or manufacturing.“They need to collaborate so that they can work on each other’s strengths.”Isro has in-house 3D printers to produce components and products for validating designs and for use in technology demonstrators. But as it scales up its operations—6-18 launches a year, over 70 satellites for the country’s need, scientific exploration, and launch services for global clients — it is increasingly farming work to private firms.“It is an opportunity for indigenising systems,” said Ajay Parikh, head of Wipro 3D. The company, which is building India’s first homegrown 3D metal printer along with the Indian Institute of Science, offers consulting, work on engineering the systems, identifying the right alloys, and testing before deploying with customers. “The end-to-end offering is the sweet spot for us,” Parikh said, adding that there is enough interest among companies and organisations for 3D-printed parts and systems.While the process is evolving, the agency still needs a CNC machine for finishing 3D-printed products, he said. Stratasys, a manufacturer of plastic 3D printers and which helped GTRE design a plastic engineering model of the Kaveri engine, says it could produce it in 30 days. This helped its partners and customers understand the complexity of the engine better. “Aerospace industry has been using 3D printing in interiors and other areas.We have plastic 3D-printed parts in some Airbus aircraft,” said Rajiv Bajaj, managing director, India and Southeast Asia, for Stratasys. The company is working on a metal 3D printing machine that will be launched soon.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/india-is-slowly-catching-up-with-the-world-to-use-3d-printing-in-building-products/articleshow/67085613.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3504_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "India has been late in full-scale adoption of 3D printing in the aerospace sector.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3504_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67085634,width-300,imgsize-62590,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_3504_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67085646,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Why many Indians are moving to South East Asia to launch their ventures", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3506_News_0>For Navin Suri, who was heading Bank of New York Mellon’s asset management business in Hong Kong, Singapore was the obvious choice when it came to setting up.He said he had always heard about the “ease of doing business” in Singapore, but even he was taken aback when it took him less than 30 minutes to set up his data technology company in 2014. From getting his registration number to signed MoUs, it all got done between 10.40 and 11.10 pm SGT. “I even got a prompt from the government with suggestions as to how I could set up a website,” says Suri, co-founder of Percipient.South East Asia is also a fantastic gateway for startups looking to go global. Chandrima Das, founder of Bento, says they were working towards an international clientele and hence their decision to be based in Singapore and focus on the Asean market to start with. “Today my focus on the Asian market has paid out. We are actively targeting and working with clients in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries. For instance, we work today with Siam Commercial Bank, which has a 11 million customer base, a base we have acquired despite, or because of being based in Singapore. If you look at just Singapore the entire population base is 5.6 million,” she says.Das says being regulated in Singapore also helps immensely. “Because not only are the Singaporean authorities fast and efficient, they are also highly stringent when it comes to security checks and audits. After we got our fund management license from Singapore, we knew it would be much easier for us to enter Thailand and Indonesia,” she says.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3506_News_1> Another major attraction is the tax rate. “It’s half of that in India. South East Asia helps you retain more of your earnings and price your products more competitively,” says Shailesh Tiwari, CEO of GameChange Solutions, which looks to drive employee productivity and engagement with gaming and interactive work models.He also noted that often the government throws its weight behind a startup. Something that Percipient’s Suri experienced first hand, when he got to share the stage with PM Narendra Modi and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) officials at the fintech festival in Singapore in November 2018. “We are creating the exchange Apix, which will connect 100 banks in the next 3 years, with USbased Virtusa. Such government interest really helps young companies like us survive,” says Suri. The fintech festival saw more than 40,000 participants of whom more than 10% were Indians, say organisers.Indian startups are increasingly occupying centrestage. Ankiti Bose’s fashion startup Zilingo raised more than $226 million in its last round of funding, valuing it at $970 million. Another $30 million bump up in valuation and it will become one of the rare unicorns with a female founder.Governments in South East Asia are now offering a range of mentorship, seed funding, introduction to investors, faster regulatory clearances and a hands-on approach to solve any and all problems. From funding their laptops (if they are a small startup) to providing salary subsidies for experienced hires (aged 60 and above), the business-friendly atmosphere is omni-present.Industry sources say 1 in 7 startups in South East Asia are started by Indians or Indian-origin CEOs. “In our Singapore Fintech Association, 3 of 10 board members are Indians, the others are Chinese or Malays. Seeing the exponential growth of our cluster of 350 startups, the Monetary Authority of Singapore actually organised an event in Mumbai and Delhi this February to further highlight opportunities for those wanting to set base here. Our fintech chaupal WhatsApp group alone has some 350 small and large startups, from Instarem, which raised more than $60 million to players like Active. AI, which raised about $10 million,” says Varun Mittal, board member, Singapore Fintech Association and founder of HelloPay, which was sold to Alibaba Financial. “There are also VC funds like Jungle Ventures and 500 Startups that are focused primarily on Indians setting shop in South East Asia,” he says.Founders also point to government involvement even for early-stage startups with different grants and schemes. One of these is Spring’s Startup Enterprise Development Scheme (SEEDS), which has a co-financing option, that is, investing the same amount as a third party investor or fund, up to $1.47 million. Another is IDM Jump-start and Mentor (i.JAM), which has supported more than 250 startups, including those of Indian CEOs. This grant of $37,000 lets startups do concept testing and market validation before seeking external investment. Singapore also has its own set of active accelerators and incubators including Startupbootcamp FinTech, Fatfish, Rockstart and NTUC U Startup.Among the beneficiaries of Singapore government grants is payments platform Instarem, which last month closed its series C funding of $41. Co-founder Prajit Nanu, despite living in Mumbai since childhood, chose Singapore to set up the venture. “There were so many government grants available to us. In 2015, we secured one grant for product innovation and got a 40% rebate on all the laptops we got for our staff. More importantly, Enterprise Singapore arranged so many meetings, it served as an induction to their ecosystem,” he says.Instarem got a direct issue license for credit cards in Singapore. “In India, there is no such equivalent and the regulation is in a grey area. Also any license we apply for in India, we have no idea if it will take 2 or 12 months for clearance. There are other differences. Only now a few Indian banks have opened up their APIs. In Singapore, open APIs have become mandatory and are regulated. It’s the same with data localisation issues,” Nanu says Startups also receive guidance on regulatory issues, says Varun Mittal of Singapore Fintech Association. “If there are possible roadblocks or noncompliance issues ahead, fintechs are warned before hand. And helped. Which is why from just a dozen Indian fintech startups in 2010-11, now there are more than 350 recognisable fintech startups, and probably hundreds more in the fashion, e-commerce, and retail spaces,” says Mittal.A lot of larger homegrown Indian fintechs are also relocating to Singapore to expand in South East Asia for the ease of doing business, tech-friendly market, lower tax rate (17-22% compared to India’s 30%), ease of hiring expat Indian talent and regulatory clarity. “We work in the area of cloud data storage and we took an early decision in 2012 to move base to Singapore for an international audience. Given India’s emerging laws and RBI’s often changing stance, we would have been out of business had we focused only on India,” say the founder of an Indian fintech firm that relocated to Singapore.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/why-many-indians-are-moving-to-se-asia-to-launch-their-ventures/articleshow/68878843.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3506_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3506_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68878870,width-300,imgsize-345323,,resizemode-4,quality-100/singapore-changi-oairpot.jpg"}, {"caption": "singapore", "id": "Economictime_PL_3506_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-68878861,quality-100/singapore.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Government plans to incentivise ONGC, Oil India to raise output", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3514_News_0>The government is planning to incentivise ONGC and Oil India to raise output from fields given without auction to state-run firms in previous years, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said.“Most of the policy changes made in recent years apply to new fields or those that would start producing in future. We are thinking of offering fiscal incentives to nomination blocks, which is where the bulk of our production lies,” petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday, after launching the second bid round of the new open acreage licensing policy. The government is auctioning 14 blocks in this round for which bids will be accepted until March 12.In the past four years, the government has ushered in several policy reforms aimed at attracting investment in the exploration and production sector, and boosting domestic oil production which has been declining for years. A new exploration licensing policy that offers marketing and pricing freedom for gas producers, and a higher gas price for output from difficult fields have been the key policy changes made to ignite interest in the country’s upstream sector.<IMG Economictime_PL_3514_News_1> Nearly 70% of India’s oil production is generated by fields that were nominated to ONGC and Oil India before the country started auctioning blocks in the 1990s. State-run firms have in the past demanded incentives for some of their gas fields that are unviable at current domestic prices.Much of the locally-produced gas is priced as per a government-set formula based on rates from international gas hubs. But given the lower global rates, local prices have been too low for some fields to become viable, according to industry executives. The government has another formula for gas from difficult fields, which require higher investments, to compensate producers.This price is usually more than double that of normal local gas price and applies only to fields that had not begun producing when this rule came into effect about two years ago.Pradhan said difficult fields in nomination blocks too will get special incentives. He did not give more details on this nor did he say how soon the details will be unveiled. The general election is barely months away, leaving the government with a fast-shrinking time window for any policy changes. In the second exploration licensing round, the government is offering 14 blocks. Of these, four have been carved by the government while the rest are based on the interests shown by companies. Under the new policy, companies can express interest for a block whose boundaries they are free to determine. The government accumulates such interests from companies for six months and then auctions them.Eight of the 14 blocks are located on land, five in shallow water and one in ultra-deep water.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-plans-to-incentivise-ongc-oil-india-to-raise-output/articleshow/67427379.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3514_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3514_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67427379,width-300,imgsize-560789,,resizemode-4,quality-100/.jpg"}, {"caption": "Oil", "id": "Economictime_PL_3514_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67427383,quality-100/oil.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Microsoft all set to take on Apple with iPad-like, low-cost, Surface tab", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3517_News_0> Microsoft Corp. is planning to release a line of lower-cost Surface tablets as soon as the second half of 2018, seeking a hit in a market for cheaper devices that Apple Inc. dominates with the iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.  Microsoft has tried this before. The software giant kicked off its consumer-oriented hardware push in 2012 with the launch of the original Surface RT. At the time, it was priced starting at $499. After the tablets didn’t resonate with consumers and product reviewers, Microsoft pivoted to the more-expensive Surface Pro, a line which has gained steam and likely contributed to demand for a pro-oriented iPad, which Apple launched in 2015.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3517_News_1>   The new tablets will feature 10-inch screens -- around the same size as a standard iPad, but smaller than the 12-inch screens used on the Surface Pro laptop line. The new Surfaces, priced about $400, will have rounded edges like an iPad, differing from the squared off corners of current models. They’ll also include USB-C connectivity, a first for Surface tablets, a new charging and syncing standard being used by some of the latest smartphones.  The tablets are expected to be about 20 percent lighter than the high-end models, but will have around four hours fewer of battery life. The current Surface Pro can last 13.5 hours on a single charge, according to Microsoft. Intel Corp. will supply the main processor and graphics chips for the devices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.  Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, declined to comment.  Microsoft has struggled to find a high-volume hit with the Surface devices as well as to introduce a flow of new choices to keep growth steady. In the fiscal year that ended last June, Surface revenue declined 2 percent as the company faced lower volume sales owing to an aging Surface Pro line. Revenue rose 32 percent in the most recent quarter, indicating new interest in Microsoft’s hardware.  Apple sold about 44 million iPads that generated almost $20 billion in revenue during the past four quarters. Microsoft’s entire Surface hardware business produced $4.4 billion for the same period.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3517_News_2>   In March, Apple launched a new iPad model for $329 geared toward education users. The new cheaper Surfaces could likewise appeal to students and teachers, and to schools that buy less-expensive devices in bulk.  The current professional-oriented Surface Pro lineup starts at $799. Microsoft, which hasn’t finalized its plans, is expected to price the cheapest versions of the new device at about $400. Like the Surface Pro, these models won’t be bundled with the company’s keyboard cover. To go along with the lower-cost device, Microsoft is preparing less-expensive versions of its keyboard cover, stylus and mouse, the people said. The current keyboard cover costs an extra $160, while the new keyboard will be priced a bit lower, they said.  The company is planning multiple models, including versions with 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes of storage and models that can connect to LTE cellular networks, according to the people. It will continue to have the kickstand for upright typing and watching video. Like Microsoft’s other devices, it will run Windows 10 Pro.  Since 2015, Apple has rapidly added new productivity tools to the iPads, taking on Microsoft features like integration with digital drawing pens and using multiple apps at the same time. The company is planning on releasing a revamped iPad Pro this year with iPhone X features such as facial recognition, Bloomberg News reported last year.  Microsoft last released a device in the lower-cost category in 2015 with the Surface 3, which started at $499 and featured a 10.8-inch screen. The company stopped making it at the end of 2016.  The new line will be part of a growing ecosystem of Microsoft hardware products that, beyond the tablets, includes the Surface Laptop, Surface Book laptop with a detachable screen, and the Surface Studio desktop computer.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/microsoft-all-set-to-take-on-apple-with-ipad-like-low-cost-surface-tab/articleshow/64190555.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3517_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3517_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-64190662,width-650,imgsize-25767,,resizemode-4,quality-100/microsoft-all-set-to-take-on-apple-with-their-ipad-like-low-cost-surface-tab.jpg"}, {"caption": "Microsoft all set to take on Apple with their iPad-like low cost Surface tab", "id": "Economictime_PL_3517_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64190672,quality-100/microsoft-all-set-to-take-on-apple-with-their-ipad-like-low-cost-surface-tab.jpg"}, {"caption": "Microsoft all set to take on Apple with their iPad-like low cost Surface tab", "id": "Economictime_PL_3517_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64190717,quality-100/microsoft-all-set-to-take-on-apple-with-their-ipad-like-low-cost-surface-tab.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Soap opera: Eye on Future, HUL launches laundry brand after 30 years", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3556_News_0>MUMBAI: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is launching a new laundry brand after three decades that appears to be aimed at the country’s biggest retailer Future Group. The latter recently cut HUL’s shelf space by nearly a third in the segment to make space for Future’s own line of detergent liquid and powder products.The new liquid detergent product from parent Unilever’s portfolio, Love Home and Planet, will be HUL’s fifth fabric wash brand, and is expected to be launched next month, said two officials aware of the development. The move is reminiscent of HUL’s introduction of Wheel detergent in 1988 to take on Nirma, which had dislodged Surf as washing powder of choice in middleclass and lower-middleclass Indian homes. HUL’s other detergent brands are Rin, Surf Excel and Sunlight and the company accounts for a third of India’s Rs 24,000 crore laundry market. <IMG Economictime_PL_3556_News_1> Common FeaturesHUL is also hoping to score on the green front with an environmentally friendly product.While HUL declined to comment, Future Group said its liquid detergent brand Voom’s positioning is “caring for fabric and fashion”, something that’s new in a segment that thrives on stain removal. “We feel existing laundry makers will follow this narrative but our pricing and fashion push will be far more competitive,” said Ashni Biyani, managing director of Future Consumer Ltd, the group’s consumer goods arm that introduced the product last week.The two brands from HUL and Future Group have some common features. They are being marketed as liquid detergents that are largely aimed at urban, modern trade consumers. Both are targeting millennials through fashion — HUL’s launch will be at Lakme Fashion Week next month while Future Consumer’s brand is being sold across its fashion stores such as FBB, Brand Factory and Central.The similarities stop there, analysts said.“Globally, liquid format accounts for a larger chunk of the laundry sales and consumers are also gradually moving to more clean, less harsh and environment friendly products,” said Abneesh Roy, executive vice president, Edelweiss Securities. “HUL’s new product merges both these trends and the launch is triggered by premiumisation and sustainability strategy, and not to copy competition.”Unilever has what it hopes will be another ace up its sleeve. The brand is part of its newest line of vegan and plant-based, homecare products in the fabric-care, dish-wash and surface-care segments launched in the US earlier this year. The ingredients are said to be plant-based and ethically sourced and the products have recyclable packaging. In India, Unilever Ventures has invested in vegan and organic skincare startup Pureplay Skin Sciences, which sells skin and hair care products under brands Plum and Phy.  HUL’s product will be priced at about Rs 350, more than double Future’s Voom, which has a tag of Rs 150 for a litre pack. At Rs 225, P&G’s premium liquid detergent brand Ariel is also priced lower.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/soap-opera-eye-on-future-hul-launches-laundry-brand-after-30-years/articleshow/70237491.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3556_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Representative Image", "id": "Economictime_PL_3556_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-70237500,width-300,imgsize-97105,,resizemode-4,quality-100/1.jpg"}, {"caption": "1", "id": "Economictime_PL_3556_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-70238678,quality-100/1.jpg"}]}

The exchange is eyeing 25 per cent-50 per cent of the Rs 3,000-crore physical market to use the price hedging on its platform in the first year.Talking to ET, Sanjit Prasad, CEO, ICEX said “Historically black pepper contract is one of the oldest contracts to have been launched in the commodity derivative market. Unfortunately, it has witnessed a chequered history. ICEX, after doing an in-depth study of the physical market, has consciously decided to re-launch contract based on litre weight- 550 GL rather than location specific characteristics-MG1.”The physical market size of black pepper is about Rs 3,000 crore per year. The commodity exhibits extreme price volatility impacting the producer, exporter, and importer. “Hence, the launch of ICEX black pepper derivatives will be of great economic relevance to the black pepper physical market ecosystem,” said Prasad.ICEX is eyeing a modest 25-50 per cent of the Rs 3,000 crore physical market to use the price hedging on ICEX platform in the first year. As witnessed in case of diamonds, commodities which are listed for the first time in India witness a spike in growth after completing few delivery cycles as the trade gets familiar with the product, said the ICEX CEO.The physical market size of black pepper is about Rs 3,000 crore and the delivery centre is Kadavanthra, Ernakulum. The price of black pepper is around Rs 36,000 to Rs 37,000 per quintal. Kerala produces the finest pepper from India. Here pepper is generally grown as a mixed crop. <IMG Economictime_PL_3573_News_1> In Wayanad in Kerala, black pepper is grown in coffee plantations and cultivated on a large scale. Two varieties of Indian pepper that are of great demand in the international market are the Malabar Garbled and the Tellichery Extra Bold.ICEX contract would be 550gm/litre weight which conforms to the quality standard produced and consumed in the prevailing market.Black pepper exhibits extreme price volatility impacting the producer, consumer and trading community. There have been various grades in black pepper based on the quality parameters and origin.Due to growing acreage in other south Asian countries, the illegal flow of the commodity is posing threat to price stabilisation and becomes the reason for price volatility in recent years. However, to protect domestic farmers, government has imposed a minimum import price Rs 500 per kg. Hence, an electronic trading platform lends itself to a fair and transparent price discovery process keeping in mind the demand and supply forces of the commodity. The commodity exhibits price volatility 15 per cent to 17 per cent annually. The domestic consumption of this commodity is also witnessing a high growth. Black pepper market consists with domestic usages as well import and re-export with value addition.

Bonneville, a twin-cylinder bike made by British company Triumph, boasted classic lines. Kumar, who is currently pushing 70, rode home a brand new one from a dealership in the Capital last month.\"I am retired, my kids are well-settled,\" he said. \"It's time I lived my dream.\"Thousands of consumers like Kumar are going back in time, as companies launch a slate new products with nostalgia-inducing names. From motorcycles and watches to cameras and clothing, reissues of iconic designs are helping them hook new customers and luring back the old ones.\"It's a classic case of a trend coming back after the end of a product life cycle,\" said Ashita Aggarwal, a professor of marketing at Mumbai's SP Jain Institute of Management. \"For instance, bell bottoms made a reemergence in fashion around eight years ago and died a quick death but not before leaving behind some cues for clothing companies to build on. Temple jewellery is in vogue currently. Tanishq has a plethora of designs based on it. Launching nostalgia-themed products also enable companies keep the price high because the customer base is very niche and the products are aspirational.\"Sergi Canovas, MD of Ducati India, said, trends change fast, even in the motorcycle segment. \"A couple of years ago, the interest was in bikes from the forties and fifties,\" he said. \"Currently, manufacturers are focusing on models from the seventies and eighties. So, it's important for them to have all kinds of models in their portfolio to keep up with changing trends.\"To cash in on the blast from the past, Classic Legends, a subsidiary of the Mahindra Group, recently relaunched the Jawa brand. It showcased new 300-cc iterations of motorcycles from the seventies and the eighties. Chennai-headquartered Royal Enfield, too, launched two 650cc twin-cylinder retro-styled motorcycles, the Continental GT and Interceptor, which most consumers have only seen in yellowed posters.<IMG Economictime_PL_3592_News_1> \"To a certain extent, ‘heritage' hints at quality,\" said Samsika Marketing Consultants CMD Jagdeep Kapoor. \"If you go to several five-star restaurants, you will find tea being served in ‘kulhads', food being served on banana leaves.

He recently bought Carvaan, the retro-styled Bluetooth speaker that comes pre-loaded with 5,000 old songs. \"It's difficult to find melody these days,\" he said.The latent demand for old songs has not only made Carvaan one of the top-selling Bluetooth speakers in India in one year but also helped revive its maker, India's oldest record label, Saregama. Around 2.3 lakh units of Carvaan were sold in the in the second quarter of 2018-19, a 40% increase in sales. Saregama's year-on-year net profit jumped 233% and revenue was up 64%, prompting the company to take it to overseas markets such as, the USA, UK, Middle East and Canada.\"People are listening to Carvaan for seven-and-a-half hours a day and a kid in Delhi recently hosted a Rajesh Khanna party with it as the music source,\" said RP-Sanjeev Goenka Group chairman Sanjeev Goenka. \"We had targeted older consumers during the launch but now even younger ones are buying it.\"A similar trend has played out in apparel and footwear segments. German sportswear company Adidas launched its ‘Originals' line of clothing in India to target consumers in the age group of 14-30 years, while Puma, Asics and Fila brought back themes from their past. \"Around 30% of our sales currently come from retro-branded footwear and clothing,\" said Puma India MD, Abhishek Ganguly.\"When people get tired of clicks and glitz, they turn to something solid and reassuring,\" said brand expert Harish Bijoor. \"Most products styled on yesteryears are usually high-quality, whether its watches, cameras or clothing.\" For instance, in the realm of timekeeping, watchmakers, including Omega, Seiko and Oris, have launched reissues—the Railmaster, Grand Seiko and Divers Sixty-Five respectively, durable watches that were in vogue decades ago.

Still at the concept stage, the company is looking to hire a team by January next year, as it tests out its product with a clutch of startups. “The idea is to disrupt traditional consulting firms with tech-backed solutions and tools which do not require hundreds of partners,” a person familiar with the duo’s plan said. “They aim to help transform product-market fit and initial business momentum into at-scale, well-rounded companies, a problem being faced by many in the Indian ecosystem. This, they have realised, cannot be solved by capital alone.”The platform is targeting Series B and C startups and will offer them software tools, consulting on a self serve model, and mentorship and learning. “It is a mix of SAP, Coursera and McKinsey for startups as they want to create a new-age consulting model,” the person added.The venture comes less than a month after Bansal stepped down abruptly from his group CEO and chairman roles at Flipkart, after a probe was conducted to investigate him on charges of “personal misconduct”. US retail behemoth Walmart, which owns 77% of Flipkart, said those charges weren’t found to be true. Bansal and Krishnamurthy did not respond to ET’s emailed questionnaire till press time on Thursday. <IMG Economictime_PL_3621_News_1> Tech-backed fix for scaling upPeople close to the matter said Krishnamurthy, popularly known as Saiki among colleagues and friends, is likely to be the CEO whereas Bansal, who holds a board position on Flipkart with almost 5% stake, will be the executive chairman. Krishnamurthy quit Ola in September after a short 11-month stint and has been working on x10x for the past few months.The Bengaluru-based company in its current form will have three types of offerings: a product suite across strategy and data science to execution; a learning platform with curated courseware, events and reference cases; and consulting and mentoring to help founders.Startup founders that ET spoke to expressed the need for such a product offering. “Sometimes, due to the pressures and realities of running a startup, you often realise problems after the error has been committed. There are some avenues to seek guidance today, but nothing where a mentor or an experienced founder can play an active real-time role in the tactical execution of the problems faced by a startup — essentially a way to pre-empt these issues,” said Rohit Ramasubramanian, CEO of GoZefo, an online marketplace for pre-owned furniture and appliances.ET reported in its November 27 edition that Flipkart’s cofounder Sachin Bansal, who too left the company he started along with Binny, was preparing to make a comeback with a new venture. Sachin is establishing a holding company through which he will run his new businesses as well as make investments.Krishnamurthy came to Flipkart in 2015 from McKinsey as chief operating officer of its commerce division. During his two-year stint at Flipkart, he moved across several roles, the last one being head of supply chain eKart. After he quit Flipkart, Krishnamurthy headed back to McKinsey as a part-time adviser, after which he was roped in by Ola to head growth.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/binny-bansal-former-flipkart-executive-to-launch-new-startup/articleshow/67085632.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3621_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The platform is targeting Series B and C startups and will offer them software tools, consulting on a selfserve model, and mentorship and learning.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3621_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67085681,width-300,imgsize-223435,,resizemode-4,quality-100/binny-bansal.jpg"}, {"caption": "Untitled-11", "id": "Economictime_PL_3621_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67085768,quality-100/untitled-11.jpg"}]}

The virus originated in mainland China and has killed more than 2,000 people. <IMG Economictime_PL_3650_News_1> \"Obviously what happened in Japan was horrendously unfortunate,\" he said. \"(But) I think the longer-term impact will be negligible.

Children are not allowed. He is starting with four ships but could expand further.\"We have one advantage which is that with Virgin we've got millions and millions of people who use our products,\" Branson said, adding he had never previously wanted to go on a cruise ship.\"I wanted to see if I could test our teams to create the kind of cruise ship that myself and my friends would like to come on. I think that they've pulled it off,\" he said.Built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy, Scarlet Lady will host 2,770 passengers and 1,160 crew.

Joshi has also collaborated with a Delhi-based textile house to design a collection of autoclaved or sanitized ready-to-wear head scarves for cancer patients who tend to naturally lose their hair during therapy.        “I had close exposure to people going through cancer, including my mother. I am well-versed with the symptoms and problems that bother them during the phase of the treatment. Their lips get dry due to radiation. They steer clear from chemical fragrances. I decided to fill the gap in the market by extensive interactions with oncologists and created a paraben-free and sulphate-free range,” says Joshi.Since her family business owns a pharma research and laboratory, Joshi had the backing to experiment, sample and manufacture the range suited for cancer patients.        The scarves are priced from Rs 1100-1700 and skin care about Rs 200. They are shipped in the domestic market through her marketplace as well as ecommerce giant Amazon.“The treatment cost is priority for the patients. The price point of the product range, although premium, had to be kept reasonable,” she says. Joshi’s journey does not end here. She is busy building the roadmap to better the lives of those dealing with cancer by adding products like body oil, natural body wash and disinfectant spray in a month’s time.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/cancer-crusader-bengaluru-launches-online-market-place-exclusively-for-patients/articleshow/67793727.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3653_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3653_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-67793944,width-650,imgsize-156309,,resizemode-4,quality-100/cancer_hope_640x480_thinkstock.jpg"}, {"caption": "AditiJoshi", "id": "Economictime_PL_3653_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-67794034,quality-100/aditijoshi.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Texting won't be the same again: Android creator building AI phone that can message", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3679_News_0>Essential Products Inc., the consumer electronics startup run by Android creator Andy Rubin, is putting most projects aside to focus on development of a new kind of phone that will try to mimic the user and automatically respond to messages on their behalf, according to people familiar with the plans.The company paused development of a planned home speaker, months after canceling a different smartphone that had been in the works, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Sales of an earlier phone were disappointing, and the company is abandoning the effort partly because the product is too similar to others on the market. Essential had considered selling itself this year after a series of setbacks. <IMG Economictime_PL_3679_News_1> The design of the new mobile device isn’t like a standard smartphone. It would have a small screen and require users to interact mainly using voice commands, in concert with Essential’s artificial-intelligence software. The idea is for the product to book appointments or respond to emails and text messages on its own, according to the people familiar with the plans. Users would also be able to make phone calls from the planned device.If this all sounds a bit like the sci-fi movie “Her,” that’s sort of by design. Rubin would like to capture people’s imagination with a product that’s truly different from alternatives. The planned device, which hasn’t been previously reported, could be Essential’s last hope to break into a market dominated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. A spokeswoman for Essential declined to comment. <IMG Economictime_PL_3679_News_2> In an interview with Bloomberg last year, Rubin suggested a benevolent incentive for embarking on a project along these lines. “If I can get to the point where your phone is a virtual version of you, you can be off enjoying your life, having that dinner, without touching your phone, and you can trust your phone to do things on your behalf,” he said. “I think I can solve part of the addictive behavior.”Although novel, the concept faces many practical challenges. People who have spent any time talking to Siri or Alexa know the limits of virtual assistants. As a result, Essential expects to market the product as a complement to people’s smartphones or as a phone for those who want to spend less time tethered to their screens.  Essential is backed by about $300 million, making it Silicon Valley’s most ambitious consumer-electronics upstart in years. The Palo Alto, California-based company started selling a product called the Essential Phone last year, to great fanfare for pioneering an edge-to-edge design before the iPhone X. Since the release of the first Essential Phone and Apple’s premium product, many phone makers have followed. But the Essential Phone struggled to sell due to its relatively high price and software bugs.In the last year, the company has been clouded by sexual harassment allegations involving Rubin’s time at Google. Rubin denied claims of sexual misconduct and took a brief leave of absence from Essential last November. In the first half of this year, Rubin put the company up for sale and canceled a second version of the Essential Phone, Bloomberg reported in May.By the time Essential decided to put the home-speaker project on hold, it had already lost key engineers working on the project amid disagreements over the prospects for launching such an ambitious device. Rubin imagined it as a single hub with its own voice-command technology that could run queries through Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant -- a feat that would likely require cooperation from three competitors.Rubin, who laid foundation for the modern smartphone business with his work at Google, hopes to achieve a second act with the new, AI-dependent gadget. Essential aims to have a first prototype of the phone finished by the end of the year, a person familiar with its development said. The person said the company may show off the device to industry partners as soon as January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the same venue where it talked up its original phone last year.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/texting-wont-be-the-same-again-android-creator-said-to-be-building-ai-phone-that-messages-for-you/articleshow/66150541.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3679_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3679_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-66150655,width-650,imgsize-564558,,resizemode-4,quality-100/texting.jpg"}, {"caption": "Android_Others", "id": "Economictime_PL_3679_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-66150707,quality-100/android_others.jpg"}, {"caption": "Andyrubin", "id": "Economictime_PL_3679_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-66150734,quality-100/andyrubin.jpg"}]}

A straight decline since 2011-12 has pushed up country’s import dependence in six years to 83.2% from 75.6%, a trend that runs counter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan of cutting import dependence by 10% to 68% by 2022.India paid $88 billion for importing crude in 2017-18. Having already spent $49 billion on oil imports in the April-August period, Indian refiners are set to fork out much more this year with crude touching $85 a barrel. <IMG Economictime_PL_3681_News_1> A battered rupee, past the record 74-level to a dollar on Tuesday, is making matters worse for fuel consumers. Record prices of petrol and diesel have triggered price control and duty cut by the government. After Modi set a 10% import reduction target in March 2015, the government launched a new exploration licensing policy, auctioned new blocks, introduced higher economic incentives for biofuel production, and pushed harder for biofuel blending in petrol and diesel.But these measures have been inadequate in raising local crude output or cutting import in the short term.In the first round of auction under the new exploration licensing policy, only a handful of private players participated and foreign companies kept out.

{"title": "Will CSD revert to its vanquished flaws with Air Marshal Baladitya's exit?", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3693_News_0>Sitting in Adelphi, the six-storey power centre of Canteen Stores Department (CSD) in Mumbai, M Baladitya still recalls his first few months after being made chairman of the board of administration at CSD in November 2016.Barely two weeks into his tenure, (then Air Vice-Marshal) Baladitya requested to visit the worst depot under his jurisdiction.He was a bit startled when he was directed towards Khadki, a small town near Pune. Not only was it one of the richest cantonments, but also, along with Pune Cantonment, the largest in the world.However, with several products — from shampoo to luggage — rotting in dusty corners, it could have been any retailer’s nightmare. “It was the worst depot from a labour and warehousing point of view.Now, it’s the best. But I had to make many unpleasant decisions to change things,” says Baladitya.Worse, he couldn’t bring fresh outside talent but had to make do with existing personnel, who were not really trained for retail service.<IMG Economictime_PL_3693_News_1> But Baladitya knew all along that he had an enormous amount to do in transforming the 70-year-old retail set-up managed by the defence ministry and worked along stern parameters.CSD sells products worth Rs 18,000 crore — biscuits and beer, shampoos and cars — to 12 million personnel of the army, navy and air force, ex-servicemen and their families.Most pressing was the task of cleaning up CSD’s image, tarnished by a series of malpractices in ration supplies for troops over the past decade. The stores department had sought to clean up its act in 2012 by getting rid of middlemen as well as army officers allegedly charging commissions from companies for getting their goods on to the shelves. But four years later, not much had changed.The attention to what companies want reflects a philosophical shift for CSD — to look outside for solutions to problems instead of insisting the army knows best.Battle strategyIn the last 22 months, Baladitya met 610 company officials — mostly CEOs and CXOs — not just to understand their concerns but also convince them that he was approachable. Lessons drawn from these kinds of interactions translated into further changes. Board meetings that were held once a year earlier increased to six annually. Time taken to launch newer brands or products was cut to half and payments to companies are now made within a month, compared with the 4-6 months earlier. The new target is to make payments in 48 hours.“What he (Baladitya) brought to the table was consumer focus, and as a supplier, that gave us confidence. He is also open to critique. We spoke the same language in terms of business,” says Jai Krishnan, chief executive, Samsonite South East Asia, which gets a whopping 25% of its annual sales from CSD. “The time lag to launch is gradually shortened but there is still room for improvement, given fast changing consumer preference.”Baladitya has tackled several problems head on. For instance, more than a fifth of all products were weeded out since they were anything but ‘fast-moving.’<IMG Economictime_PL_3693_News_2> This hit the consumer goods industry hard, as it gets 6-8% of overall sales from Canteen Stores Department.“We also used to dump unsold products at CSD as part of meeting primary sales targets every quarter. Now, we can’t do it anymore, which impacted our sales,” says a sales head of a leading homegrown fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm.Over the past two years, CSD also collected penalties of over Rs 700 crore from compani es that f louted fair pricing norms, which included matching and promotional offers given to other retailers.United Spirits, the country’s largest spirits company, was alone fined more than Rs 300 crore.Baladitya, however, refused to share the name of companies he has fined.It was all part of the mandate to make the army canteen corruption-free and operate like a civil retailer. CSD — incidentally a not-for-profit organisation — made profit of Rs 1,253 crore in the year to March 2018 due to these one-off gains, a figure higher than the combined profit of Future Retail, DMart, Shoppers Stop and Tata Trent!A year ago, it had earned a net profit of Rs 280 crore on sales of Rs 17,000 crore.Until last year, servicemen could only shop for big-ticket items such as cars and durables at two depots— in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Now, these are available pan-India. “Personally, I have never bought a fridge or a television set from the army canteen,” quips Baladitya. “It was always from places like Sarojini market in Delhi.”Now, however, Baladitya’s overhaul of the insular culture at CSD could come to a halt — he has been promoted to Air Marshal and has taken over as senior maintenance staff officer at Head Quarter Maintenance Command, Nagpur. And the job’s not even half done, he says.Enemy in the campOne, the stores still open at 9 am and work up to 5 pm in most places, which basically means soldiers have to leave work for doing their purchasing. Worse, the day a jawan gets a salary, on the first of every month, the stores are closed for stocktaking.In fact, on an average, they lose 36 working days to manual stocktaking, when depots and canteens are shut. That’s almost a revenue loss of Rs 55 crore per day, or Rs 1,500 crore annually.Existing vendors, however, are hopeful. “Things have improved dramatically over the past two years. The process change that has been introduced is irreversible, which means our changed relationship with CSD is sustainable,” says Mayank Shah, category head, Parle Products, India’s largest biscuit maker.Transportation of goods from 34 depots to 3,901 unit-run canteens — from Leh to Lakshadweep — is still an ordeal. At present, lipsticks and chocolates are crammed into the same truck that carries detergents and suitcases. CSD intends to outsource these functions to companies, which have a dedicated fleet for a variety of products.<IMG Economictime_PL_3693_News_3> “Post GST, a lot has changed in terms of orders, which were decentralised at depot level and now again, at the head office. But payment still takes months (in the wait for) approval from headquarters and it has worsened after the new tax regime.Baladitya’s stint is like a surgery that has been left midway,” says the chief executive of a personal care company.CSD is dealing with commercial organisations but has to follow government norms, which have their own inertia. Putting a new brand on the shelves means the consumer company has to go through bureaucracy and months of paperwork.And the most complex retail chains in terms of operations are still not automated at a centralised level.“We have been trying to list our products for over nine months. Apart from time consuming paperwork, they also do market surveys on pricing and factory visits to ensure product quality. We would rather focus on existing trade channels than spend our resources on CSD’s archaic procedures. While middlemen are not a legal option, we will still opt for one due to the ordeal we have had so far,” says the sales head of a mid-sized food company.Marshal's adviceBaladitya holds a more balanced view. “I hold both sides responsible,” he says, “both bribe taker and giver. We need companies to be ethical too. In hindsight, I would have loved to visit army canteens of developed nations such as the UK or the US and bring their best practices here.”Typically, the price differential between retail stores and CSD ranges from 10% to 40% since army canteens get a refund of 50% of the goods and services tax (GST) paid from states and the Centre. With the government waiving a substantial amount of taxes and further negotiation with companies for discounts, prices are the lowest in the country.This means a few army personnel will sell high-end items — infamously, liquor — in civil markets. “This is like bootlegging and hurts our image, bringing us directly into the line of fire. But we can’t do policing; that’s not our role,” concludes Baladitya. For the Air Marshal who joined the air force 36 years ago, the battle’s half-won. For CSD, it’s a victory, but still some way to base.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/will-csd-revert-to-its-vanquished-flaws-with-air-marshal-baladityas-exit/articleshow/66062904.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3693_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3693_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-66063121,width-300,imgsize-326081,,resizemode-4,quality-100/csd-bccl.jpg"}, {"caption": "canteen-stores-bccl", "id": "Economictime_PL_3693_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-66063009,quality-100/canteen-stores-bccl.jpg"}, {"caption": "army-bccl", "id": "Economictime_PL_3693_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-66063010,quality-100/army-bccl.jpg"}, {"caption": "army-csd", "id": "Economictime_PL_3693_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-66063011,quality-100/army-csd.jpg"}]}

We expect sales to be very strong,” chief executive Arvind Mediratta said.The business-to-business wholesaler, which follows an October-September financial year, is also introducing an ‘own business day’ in October to drive traffic, aligning with large companies including Procter & Gamble, Dabur, Colgate Palmolive and Nivea selling at discounted prices to neighbourhood retail outlets. “This is the start of the financial year for us and we are expecting robust numbers given the economic macros,” Mediratta said.Volume-led growth, innovations in product launches and the monsoon have added to optimism ahead of the upcoming festive quarter. Besides this, India’s economic revival has been robust and GST has been reduced on many items of daily use.“We are creating multiple pricing and packs for trade and consumers, including for organised trade and kirana stores for the festive quarter,” said Mayank Shah, category head at biscuits and snacks maker Parle Products.“We are, however, ensuring that we don’t disrupt existing equations with any of our trade channels.”A number of launches have been lined up for the December quarter, a period that straddles Dhanteras, Durga Puja, Diwali and Christmas as well as much of the wedding season, retail industry executives said.“Industry has overcome demonetisation entirely and the GST impact substantially,” said Anil Talreja, partner at consulting and audit firm Deloitte India. “So we expect festive discounting not only to be higher and more competitive, but we also anticipate some turbulence among trade channels, in terms of competitive discounting in the festive season.”Market researcher Nielsen forecast in a report late last month that the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector will grow 12-13% in calendar year 2018 on the back of a favourable economic and policy environment and the easing of trade turbulence in the past two years triggered by demonetisation and uncertainties over GST. “The trade dynamism triggered by demonetisation and GST rollout has almost settled down,\" Nielsen India executive director Sameer Shukla said in the report. “Retail offtake is buoyant with double-digit growth on the back of tailwinds — GST rate cuts, strengthening macroeconomics, and robust monsoon projections.”Homegrown packaged consumer goods maker Dabur’s chief executive Sunil Duggal said: “This festive season is certainly looking better than last year, and our consumer offers and pricing will be in sync with the outlook.”The Nielsen report noted that modern trade channels, which contribute close to 10% of the overall FMCG market, have shown high growth while the rural market has picked up as cash is back in the market. In the June quarter, FMCG sales grew 10.9% from the year earlier. In the 12 months ended June, it grew 11.6%, nearly 70% of which was driven by consumption volume. The report said overall stock levels in the retail trade have improved by 10 percentage points since early 2017.Nielsen also said that the increased focus on large-format stores by retailers, locally and nationwide, has helped distribution channels gain since June last year.From 9% last year, modern trade now accounts for 10% of the FMCG retailing market, riding on consumer preferences for convenience, the report said.Numbers for the last reported April-June quarter for large, listed consumer companies have been robust, with Hindustan Unilever and Dabur reporting volume growth of 12% and 21% ahead of street expectations, respectively, while Britannia and Marico grew by over 15% in the period.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/fmcg-plans-to-light-up-festive-season-with-pricing-offers-promotional-schemes/articleshow/65893977.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3726_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3726_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-65893977,width-300,imgsize-256336,,resizemode-4,quality-100/.jpg"}, {"caption": "gfx", "id": "Economictime_PL_3726_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-65893986,quality-100/gfx.jpg"}]}

Ford India’s shipments to foreign markets fell 12.5% in the period to 65,176 units.South Korea’s Hyundai Motor exports cars and SUVs to 88 countries across Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific from India.Among India-made models, there is strong demand for the Grand i10 and i20 in Africa and Latin America, the company said.

If you look at Hyundai, they have continuously refreshed their product portfolio.

The project has been developed by the Ministry of Textiles, The Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI) and IMG Reliance, the leader in sustainable fashion in India.The launch of project SU.RE at the Lakmé Fashion Week Sustainable Fashion Day this year was supported by United Nations in India, Lenzing EcoVero that stands for ecologically responsible production of viscose fibre made from the renewable wood, and R|Elan that produces GreenGold fibre made from 100 per cent used PET bottles with one of the lowest fibre carbon footprints globally.SU.RE stands for ‘sustainable resolution’ — a five-point agenda for the industry to move towards fashion that contributes to a clean environment. The signatories to this are 16 of India’s top fashion and retail brands: Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Arvind Fashions, Bestseller, Biba, Future Group, House of Anita Dongre, 109F, Lifestyle, Levis, Max, Raymond, Shoppers Stop, Spykar, W, Trends, and Westside. The signatories have pledged to source and utilise a substantial portion of their total consumption using sustainable raw materials and processes, by the year 2025.Project SU.RE will encourage sustainability goals for the industry to reduce its carbon emissions, increase resource efficiency, tackle waste and water management, and create positive social impact to achieve the goals set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. It will address the needs of an increasingly conscious consumer, who would prefer to buy from a brand that engages in environmental protection. Project SU.RE will also catalyse change across the sector in order to bring about innovation and transformation. <IMG Economictime_PL_3815_News_1> “As a proud Indian, I stand here today to witness history. We are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhi, who asked us to be the change you wish to see in the world. The sustainability resolution being adopted today is reflective of that very thought of the Mahatma. Never before have 16 of the biggest brands in India come together to save the earth. The combined value of the 16 signatories to the resolution is around Rs 30,000 crore. The step taken today makes for not only responsible business but also smart business.”“In the past, several products and processes of our industry were not environment-friendly. It is a tremendously responsible and timely step taken by the apparel industry of India, especially the signatories, to commit to moving towards sustainable fashion. It is a matter of pride for us at the CMAI to be associated with and be one of the drivers of this most crucial resolution.”“This is a culmination of our stated goal towards making sustainability a mainstream dialogue. This initiative will be the start of a movement that can have strategic impact over the next five years as major retailers move towards embracing sustainability at their core.”“The future of design is foremost about design with a future. Without sustainable supply chains, the fashion industry will become less and less viable. Project SU.RE opens a new dialogue to accelerate concrete actions for sustainability and climate action, and reduce environmental costs, through the entire value chain of clothes manufacturing.”“Being an industry leader in petrochemicals and a responsible corporate citizen, RIL has embraced circularity and sustainability in our core values and operations. We strongly support project SU.RE, as it will help in reducing the environmental impact of the fashion industry. Furthermore, RIL has initiated various programmes such as ‘Fashion for Earth’, under which the Circular Design Challenge, India’s first sustainability award in fashion, has been developed.”“Sustainable fashion is moving beyond just a buzzword to an integral part of the global industry. SU.RE initiative is a crucial step in this direction for India. Lenzing has been at the forefront of sustainable and innovative textile solutions. Our innovations like Lenzing EcoVero bear the potential to provide the right raw material to the brands in order to strengthen their sustainable resolution.”The five-point ‘sustainable resolution’ signed by the brands1. Develop a complete understanding of the environmental impact of the garments being currently produced by our brand.2. Develop a sustainable sourcing policy for consistently prioritising and utilising certified raw materials that have a positive impact on the environment.3. Make the right decisions about how, where, and what we source across the value chain by selecting sustainable and renewable materials and processes and ensuring their traceability.4. Communicate our sustainability initiatives effectively to consumers and media through our online and physical stores, product tags/ labelling, social media, advertising campaigns and events.5.

{"title": "Get beard-ready: HUL to help men groom better with new range of products", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3873_News_0> MUMBAI: Hindustan Unilever (HUL), India’s largest consumer products company, and Amazon have co-developed a line of hair and male grooming products that will be sold exclusively on the Web marketplace, marking the first such partnership for Unilever globally.The new products, including beard oil, beard wash and balm, and hair cream and gels under the Brylcreem brand, will also be Unilever’s first attempt to enter the nascent yet fast-growing category that has seen Marico and Emami buying beard grooming companies in India last year.“It is the first time Unilever is entering the beard grooming range and the first time we are creating a product with insights provided by Amazon India. The male grooming segment is seeing a lot of impetus – not only in metros but also even in smaller towns,” said Sandeep Kohli, executive director of personal care at HUL.Beard care is one of the fastest-growing segments within the male grooming market worth Rs 8,600 crore, thanks to the rise of a new male archetype, which has also triggered several startup companies crafting the rugged looks. <IMG Economictime_PL_3873_News_1> The current trend among Indian pogonophiles – the fancy term for beard lovers – is linked to increasing popularity of the beard in the West and is amplified by social media through Instagram and Twitter. Also, India has always had steady demand for such products, given the religious association of beards with Sikhs, Muslims and even a section of the Hindus.Marico acquired a 45% stake in Zed Lifestyle, which owns Beardo. Emami invested in The Man Company that sells premium men’s grooming products, including beard management. And one of the biggest drivers for male grooming categories has been ecommerce in India: just last month, Marico launched a premium male grooming brand Studio X exclusively on Amazon.“Brylcreem’s entire range speaks to young, digitally-savvy Indians who are seeking products that define them,” said Manish Tiwary, vice-president – category management at Amazon India.For HUL, personal care business accounts for about half its overall sales, but is largely skewed toward women’s grooming products. Analysts say this is gradually changing, and the shift is potentially negative for Emami and Marico.“HUL is investing disproportionately in online and operating with the nimbleness of a small company, but using analytics, AI and robotics like a global company. This reflects the highest level of freedom that any MNC gets in India and shows the willingness to fill product white spaces,” said Abneesh Roy, senior VP, institutional equities, Edelweiss Securities.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/get-beard-ready-hul-to-help-men-groom-better-with-new-range-of-products/articleshow/64536243.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3873_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Economictime_PL_3873_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-64536320,width-650,imgsize-109127,,resizemode-4,quality-100/malegrooming.jpg"}, {"caption": "man-grooming-suit-smartphone-gadget_thinkstock", "id": "Economictime_PL_3873_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64536326,quality-100/man-grooming-suit-smartphone-gadget_thinkstock.jpg"}]}
{"title": "How young entrepreneurs are dressing for success with niche brands of leather products", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3880_News_0>In the last five years (some say 10), conversations about fashion businesses have been increasingly peppered with words like 'niche', 'organic growth', 'handmade', 'small' and 'designs with a story'. 'Mass' has truly become a four-letter word. Niche is the new way to consume — content or concepts. American stand-up comic and actor Christopher Ryan Hardwick has remarked once: \"We are in niche consumption mode, but 'niche' doesn't mean 'small' anymore. Niche can mean focused, and particularly with the Web, which is a global audience.\"It was in 2010 that a young NIFT graduate in fashion design, Gautam Sinha (then 30) found his focus — to fill a gap in high-on-design, high-quality leather products in the Indian market. And Nappa Dori was born — a boutique leather-based brand that started with leather as its core is now moving into a space of lifestyle design with various accessories that may or may not be leather.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3880_News_1> Sinha, one of the first few niche leather makers in the country, has been through a trial by fire — establishing a new concept-based business in a landscape of mass-produced leather goods. \"Going forward, the ease of doing business has not really become easy. Despite lip service to 'Make in India', it's not that easy for small businesses.\" Sinha is talking about procuring raw materials, the corruption in acquiring retail space and the general apathy of the government towards small businesses. Fashion StatementBut the government is recognising the potential of the $17.85 billion in size during FY2015-16 of Indian leather industry (Source: Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, December 21, 2016 report). Last December, it approved a Rs 2,600 crore special package for employment generation in the leather and footwear sectors, which has the potential to generate 3.24 lakh new jobs in three years and assist in the formalisation of two lakh jobs. It may not trickle down to the niche boutique leather brands just yet, but that's not stopping young entrepreneurs who are eager to find their small little corner and occupy that.Case in point: the Mumbai-based The Sole Sisters — a boutique women shoes' company that was founded by advertising executive Chondamma Cariappa. Cariappa started The Sole Sisters as a blog for shoe-lovers in 2011 — \"where people would share pics of their shoes and that would act as a database of information for shoe-lovers.\" At that time, she was still working as a creative director with an advertising firm. It was in 2014 that she came out with a capsule collection — of 40 pieces. And since then has been retailing through her Facebook and Instagram page. <IMG Economictime_PL_3880_News_2> The leather landscape is peppered with design/concept heavy companies that are thriving on products that actually tell stories. For instance, the Jaipur-based brothers Paritosh and Priyank Mehta started The Trunks Company in 2011 to bring back the glamour of vintage trunks — for travelling, accessories and watches and even bars.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3880_News_3> The Mumbai-based former advertising executive Khyati Dodhia's The Black Canvas works on customised leather journals, earrings and miscellaneous products.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3880_News_4> Smriti Sain, based out of Delhi, works with upcycled leather for stylish handbags with her brand Chiaroscuro. <IMG Economictime_PL_3880_News_5> The Burlap People — run by friends and partners Samridhh Burman, Rewant Lokesh, and Karuna Parekh — works primarily with customised burlap bags with leather accents. \"This is the era of niche,\" says Sinha, \"In all fields you see a movement towards smaller, more focussed business, moving away from the cookie cutter products. Say for instance the food industry is catering to choices like gluten-free, organic, vegan etc. Mass market is not able to go into granular details.\" <IMG Economictime_PL_3880_News_6> Lokesh mentions how the consumer has changed over the years. \"They are looking for a product that has a story to tell and mirrors their world view. It is not just a hollow acquisition.\" TBP mainly operates through products that tell a story and \"take a stand on issue close to our hearts.\"What also helps is the breaking down of physical retail spaces courtesy online marketplaces.Most of the niche brands have very little or nil offline presence — that somehow helps them maintain a \"Scarcity is luxury\" front. But their online game is strong. With new technologies, the barriers to entry have decreased significantly for new online businesses. The time and cost to build a direct - t o -consumer brand and scale the business has been reduced, having a democratising effect on just about every industry. For instance, TBP with a tagline 'This isn't a brand, its conscious living', till now operated only through its Instagram (15.9 k followers) page — this year it plans to get few physical retail presence \"with like-minded brands\" and start its own website.Sain started Chiaroscuro in 2015 because she felt the lack of a place to buy quality bags from in India. \"In my late teens and early twenties, I had been through a number of years of buying domestic brands and fast fashion labels. Quality was always an issue. The product felt dull and banal. They aped fashion cycles and lacked any original character,\" she mentions. Enter: her own label where everything is made from upcycled leather and is more or less customised.She prefers to operate through her own website. \"It's all completely direct. We believe in being completely open, accessible and approachable and in this effort we have various access and communication tools including the social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. People call, email and WhatsApp all day and we're always there at the other end, happy to help,\" she adds.Organic GrowthIt's this service quality that Paritosh Mehta says is the key differentiator for the boutique brands. \"If you are serving a niche you have to maintain the character and nuances of a boutique business because the consumer who is coming to us can go anywhere else to buy what he seeks, so why come to us,\" he says. With The Trunks Company — an uber luxury design company — Mehta is very careful on how to look at scaling the brand. They have reduced their custommade order to 2-3 a months and are booked for that for the next six months. The rest can be ordered from their minimum range through their website as they want to keep it \"discreet and exclusive\".Organic growth is their buzzword. For instance, Cariappa is not looking to align with any online retailer but would rather create her own website this year. She has limited physical presence in India through Good Earth and Ogaan and stores in Israel, Prague, Vienna and New York. This year she has two key projects: start her website for retail and launch the Mini Sole Sisters for girls. She counts using Indian craft and fabric as her USP — the leather happens to be by the way. \"But what hurts is when your design gets copied. We have built a good amount of loyalists but fighting copies of your ideas is a big issue for niche businesses in India because of a lack of intellectual property rights and copyright laws,\" she adds.Sinha, too, is chagrined by blatant copies of not only Nappa Dori products but even the Dori name. \"India is not an easy place to do business in. The laws don't protect small businesses.\" As Mehta says, copyright infringement is a huge drawback but is quick to add, \"People who buy copies of our products are clearly not our target customers!\" For Dodhia — who started making customised leather products while freelancing as a photographer — the biggest concern is sustainability. \"Leather is an expensive material to work with and it's a challenge to keep your products affordable while competing with other brands and staying innovative. The other challenge is marketing. It's a constant struggle to stay relevant and be in contact with your potential and current customers as much as possible.\" Some of her biggest triumphs has been making customised products for top companies like Lamborghini, Volkswagen, Headphone Zone, Joseph Radhik (India's best wedding photographer).For Sain, the biggest challenge of the business has undoubtedly been people management. \"Reinforcing a more stable and responsible work etiquette with labour that looks at themselves more as labour than artists and has been working contractually for years is an uphill task. How do you build loyalty? How do you build an atmosphere of creation and support? How do you as a young 20-something upper middle class millennial reach out to and connect with artisans from a completely different sociocultural and religious background all primarily male and older than you? — are the questions that bothered us,\" she says. But obviously things have improved — not just for her but for all niche players.Sinha — who opened a Café Dori and The Nappa Dori experiential retail space in 2017 — is looking to add more key cities in their retail space but calls scaling up a big task. As Lokesh rightly points out, \"Scaling up in a concept-based business like TBP is a constant struggle between what makes sense and what makes business sense.\"", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/features/how-young-entrepreneurs-are-dressing-for-success-with-niche-brands-of-leather-products/articleshow/62395473.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Most of the niche brands have very little or nil offline presence — that somehow helps them maintain a \"Scarcity is luxury\" front.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-62395627,width-300,imgsize-251345,,resizemode-4,quality-100/fashion-brands-bccl.jpg"}, {"caption": "Nappa-Dori", "id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62395553,quality-100/nappa-dori.jpg"}, {"caption": "The-Sole-Sisters", "id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News_2", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62395476,quality-100/the-sole-sisters.jpg"}, {"caption": "The-Trunk-Company", "id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News_3", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62395484,quality-100/the-trunk-company.jpg"}, {"caption": "The-Black-Canvas", "id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News_4", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62395528,quality-100/the-black-canvas.jpg"}, {"caption": "Chiaroscuro", "id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News_5", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62395537,quality-100/chiaroscuro.jpg"}, {"caption": "The-Burlap-People", "id": "Economictime_PL_3880_News_6", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-62395504,quality-100/the-burlap-people.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Why companies like HUL, Patanjali, Dabur are taking a crack at the market for ayurvedic and herbal products", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_0>Arjun Vaidya grew up around ayurveda. As a sixth-generation member of a family steeped in this form of therapy, he remembers spending endless hours with his grandfather, a popular ayurvedic doctor in South Mumbai. Vaidya says he cured him of crippling childhood asthma. Even today, four years after his passing, patients get their prescription refilled from the clinic.  Now, the 26-year-old Vaidya wants to put the 150-odd years of knowhow to use, beyond just medicines. Riding on a growing wave of interest in natural products and ingredients, Vaidya has, over the past couple of years, evolved the brand Dr Vaidya’s into much more. With 35 products, including those for hangovers and Chyawanprash-in-a-capsule, Dr Vaidya’s wants to latch onto the trend of first building a national and then an international business around natural products and ayurveda.  Dr Vaidya’s has esteemed company. Consumer goods firms such as Patanjali, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Colgate-Palmolive and Emami are betting big bucks on this trend. As are those entrenched in the segment for decades, like Himalaya and Dabur. And, then, there are relative upstarts like Dr Vaidya’s jockeying for a share of this fast-evolving space. “We want to replicate the success of yoga (estimated by industry sources to be a $27 billion industry in the US and $80 billion globally) with ayurveda,” says Vaidya. “Consumers have evolved from wariness and suspicion to rapid adoption, as the shift towards natural products has gathered speed.”  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_1>  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_2>   Companies of all sizes are racing to keep pace. Says Issam Bachaalani, managing director, Colgate-Palmolive (India): “As consumers and lifestyles evolve, so do the benefits that consumers seek. Currently, the segment that is growing the fastest is naturals — a current consumer trend not just in India, but the world over. And it is so, across categories, not just in toothpaste.” The multinational company has launched products like Colgate Herbal, Active Salt, Active Salt Neem, Cibaca Vedshakti and Sensitive Clove. “We are growing our Naturals portfolio and will continue to provide innovations from Colgate that address specific consumer needs.”  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_3>   Colgate may be dominant in oral care, but it is seeing increasing competition from the likes of Dabur. Dabur Red is now the No. 3 player in the market. Other consumer goods companies are also jumping into the naturals market. In December 2015, HUL acquired the Indulekha brand for Rs 330 crore to step up its presence and has since made significant inroads, says a company spokesperson. “As a market leader, HUL has always invested in the market development of new and emerging categories. Naturals is a trend and that we have been calling out for a few quarters now, within our existing portfolio,” the representative says.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_4>   How Green is Personal Care In the past 12 months or so, HUL has been on a naturals blitz to claim a greater share of this market. In February 2017, it relaunched the master brand Lever Ayush (which consists of a wide range of products, including toothpaste, soap, hand wash, shampoo and face wash) in five south Indian states. It has leveraged the acquisition of Indulekha to transform it from a distinctly Kerala entity into a national brand. This has been enabled by launching variants of naturals in hair care brands like Tresemme Botanique and Clinic Plus Ayurveda. In May, it launched Citra in India — a 33-year-old naturals brand available in Indonesia and Thailand, among other countries.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_5>   HUL may be a consumer goods trailblazer, but not in the naturals space. Over the past couple of years, Patanjali Ayurved has set the market alight with its growth and seems set to maintain the momentum, with plans to double its turnover of Rs 10,000 crore in the next 12 months. Besides its core consumer care products, Patanjali, part of high-profile yoga guru Ramdev’s empire, is also looking further afield into businesses as disparate as apparel and juices to drive growth.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_6>   Along with the natural and ayurveda focus, Patanjali has in the past pitted itself as the flag bearer of patriotism, contending that its foreign rivals have done little for India despite doing business here for a long time. “We want to be the No. 1 consumer goods company in India,” says Acharya Balkrishna, CEO of Patanjali. “We regard our business as a new swadeshi movement, and want an Indian company to take back an industry long dominated by foreign companies.”  Patanjali is leading the ayurveda and naturals bandwagon, having already forayed into categories such as cosmetics and personal care, while other segments like beverages and dairy are being built up. In toothpaste, for example, Patanjali’s share has trebled to over 6% over the past year, even as company officials claim it has a 15% share in shampoo and half of the market for honey. Now, the Haridwar-headquartered operation is set to increase its headcount five-fold from around 100,000, plans to double production capacity in two years and has opened five new food parks — taking the total to six — as it seeks to maintain this breathless momentum. The company plans to raise around Rs 1,000 crore in debt to meet its ambitious targets.  Ramdev isn’t the only spiritual head who is sizing up the ayurveda goldmine. In Bengaluru, Sri Sri Tattva has also announced plans to have 1,000 stores selling its products. “We believe that companies that can mix traditional values of ayurveda with a modern outlook to business will dominate this market,” says Tej Katpitia, marketing chief of Sri Sri Tattva, the company started by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of the Art of Living movement.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_7>   Rather than just branding and marketing products, Sri Sri Tattva wants to extend it across the value chain, from growing raw material to making products with it to establishing spas and panchakarmas that will use these offerings. Currently, Sri Sri Tattva has about 300 SKUs or stock keeping products in the market, and Katpitia says dozens more are in the pipeline, with extensions into food staples also on the anvil. “We are ready to compete with not only Patanjali but global companies like HUL,” says Katpitia. The firm has launched products across categories such as staples and snacks and ambitiously plans to expand overseas, to 30 countries.  Natural Growth Nearly three decades ago Vandana Luthra founded VLCC as a beauty and slimming service. Now, the company is looking to use the naturals platform to drive the growth of its consumer care business. “The personal care industry has been witnessing a transition due to changes in consumer demands. Natural and organic products have gone up exponentially because of the increased awareness about natural products among customers and, hence, the shift in consumer behaviour,” says Natarajan MV, chief business officer, products business, VLCC. “We have now developed propositions with the richness of ayurveda herbs such as chandan, kesar and tulsi for (products including) face washes and facial kits, which are free of parabens, synthetic colourants and soap, but having the richness of ayurvedic formulations.”  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_8>   Analysts say that there are multiple reasons for this renewed interest in all things natural and ayurvedic. “The key growth factor driving the natural/herbal and ayurvedic trend in India has been the massive consumer awareness campaigns carried out by players such as Patanjali, Dabur, Sri Sri Tattva and Himalaya,” says Shreyansh Kocheri, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International. “These companies highlighted drawbacks and longterm effects of using chemical-based products (and) consumers increasingly started to look at product ingredients and demand chemical-free products.”  He reckons that strong government backing in the form of creating the AYUSH (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homeopathy) Ministry in 2014, establishing the All India Institute of Ayurveda and launching the International Day of Yoga have also helped propel the popularity of these concepts. The demand for natural products is driven by urban and rural consumers, with the latter’s purchases being driven by the availability of mass brands priced affordably with natural ingredients. This has made them shift from unbranded, homemade variants to packaged, branded products.  Companies are queueing up to take advantage of the rapid evolution in naturals and ayurveda, which have been a sidelight for decades. “Despite the growing presence of larger rivals, we have built the No. 3 brand in oral care and have a growing interest in healthcare supplements and hair care,” says KK Chutani, executive director, Dabur, the 133-year-old maker of popular products such as Dabur Amla Hair Oil and Hajmola digestive.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_9>   Over the past 12 months, Dabur has launched a slew of products such as what it claims to be India’s first ayurvedic gel toothpaste, under the Dabur Red franchise, an ayurvedic cough and cold remedy, under the Honitus and Honey-Ginger brands, and has introduced local ingredients such as amla into its Real juice brand. To keep pace with this growing market, Dabur plans to become the largest bulk grower of rare medicinal herbs in the country, by more than doubling its area under cultivation to 4,500 acres from 2,000 acres at the end of fiscal year 2017. It has tied up with internet commerce giant Amazon to make its products available on its online market place — 30 products including Meswak toothpaste to start with — and plans to add 80 more going forward.  “Mining historical data of consumer offtake in the past four or five years shows that contribution of the naturals segment in the Indian personal care (PC) industry has increased by around one percentage point every year,” says Sameer Shukla, executive director, Nielsen India. “If the trend continues, then naturals’ contribution by 2025 would be almost half of total PC sales. In absolute terms, it will be almost double the current size of total PC category.”  Over the past two decades, the Himalaya Drug Company has pioneered the shift of ayurveda’s use primarily for medicinal therapy to a wider consumer adoption. As ayurveda has gone mainstream, Himalaya’s fortunes have improved, with the company expected to hit billion dollars in revenues by 2020, from Rs 2,100 crore or around $320 million at the end of the last fiscal year. “In the personal care space, millennials are leading the herbal and naturals trend as they are becoming savvier about green choices, which is driving a marked preference for these products,” says Philipe Haydon, CEO, Himalaya Drug Company.  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_10>   The maker of the popular Liv.52 liver medication has expanded into something of a consumer care heavyweight, foraying into segments such as baby care and wellness en route. “The entry of ayurveda-based FMCG products served as a tipping point in the growth trajectory of this system of wellness. It helped in making ayurveda accessible to a younger target audience, thereby increasing its relevance,” says Haydon.  Other legacy companies too believe these trends are giving fresh impetus to their ageold businesses. Cholayil, the maker of a range of products under the Medimix brand, has grown from soaps to several other categories including face wash and moisturiser. Now, the Chennai-based firm is looking to lean on its ayurveda legacy even as it targets a younger audience that is more aware — and less suspicious— of these products.  “This sea change has been a catalyst for brands that have been offering ayurvedic products for years to hog the limelight,” says Pradeep Cholayil, chairman and managing director, Cholayil. “The rising demand for ayurvedic personal care products in recent times can be attributed to the realisation of customers; that age-old wisdom and traditional science are good for longterm health and beauty.”  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_11>  <IMG Economictime_PL_3894_News_12>", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/why-companies-like-hul-patanjali-dabur-are-taking-a-crack-at-the-market-for-ayurvedic-and-herbal-products/articleshow/61084207.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3894_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Ramdev isn’t the only spiritual head who is sizing up the ayurveda goldmine.

{"title": "Flipkart’s new loyalty programme to launch on August 15", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3901_News_0>BENGALURU: Flipkart is set to launch its own customer loyalty programme called ‘Flipkart Plus’ on August 15, wherein it will offer all its consumers loyalty points that can be used for benefits such as free delivery, early shipping and early access to products during sales to take on Amazon’s Prime programme.Flipkart will offer customers digital currency called ‘Plus Coins’ with each order, which can be used on its own platform and on partner platforms like Hotstar, BookMyShow, Zomato, MakeMy-Trip and Cafe Coffee Day.This program will not entail a membership fee, Flipkart said, unlike the Prime offering by Amazon which has monthly and annual subscription fees.This is Flipkart’s second attempt at a loyalty programme, after it briefly experimented with ‘Flipkart First’ in 2014. The company conducted customer research over recent months to shape the programme, Shaumyan Biswas, head of Flipkart Plus, marketing and ads, said.“This is a customer-benefit programme rather than a loyalty programme. Potentially, any one of our 100 million customers can earn the coins and start unlocking benefits and rewards,” said Biswas. “While Flipkart First experience was at the back of our minds, we are also building this programme from scratch based on research and data analytics,” he said. <IMG Economictime_PL_3901_News_1> Flipkart, however, did not disclose details on the criteria for customers to earn loyalty points, the value of the Plus Coins, and which categories it aims to push. The plus coins will be in the form of digital currency.ET had reported Flipkart’s plan to launch its loyalty programme last month and stated that the company has set aside $173 million to spend on services under the programme for the next three years. The company did not comment on this and said it will “spend enough to delight customers (who are) part of the programme”.“Loyalty programmes work well in the retail space. It attracts customers and increases stickiness, which is why several companies have already started it. Flipkart is a little late to the party,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman, Technopak.

{"title": "Coca-Cola plans to boost muscle with Horlicks buy", "body": "<IMG Economictime_PL_3905_News_0>Coca-Cola is set to join global consumer food giants Nestle, Danone and Hindustan Unilever and others in the $4-billion-plus pursuit to buy GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer nutrition business, people close to the development said. This marks an entirely new foray for the Atlanta headquartered firm and could give it bandwidth to play in the pure health-nutrition space aimed primarily at children, these people added. Coke has mandated Citi to help them in the competitive bidding process expected to launch next week.“The evaluation work had begun even though the sale process is yet to formally launch. It will be a large transaction, so work has already begun,” said an official involved, on condition of anonymity as the discussions are in private domain. “This also marks the company’s return to big bang M&A in a market like India.”Coke acquired Parle’s stable of brands in the early 1990s — including the popular Thums Up — and gained access to its nationwide bottling and distribution infrastructure, thereby getting a strategic advantage over others. This was the first and only transaction by the company in the country.With consumer beverage preferences changing swiftly in favour of low-sugar or functional options such as juice and juice drinks, flavoured water, dairy-based beverages and tea, the Atlanta-based company has been accelerating portfolio expansion beyond its core aerated brands. <IMG Economictime_PL_3905_News_1> Coke president T Krishnakumar told ET in May this year that it would also launch nutrition products including electrolyte hydration drinks to be sold over-the-counter at pharmacies.“So far we have been very active in the refreshment space; we now want to be a serious player in nutrition,” he had said in an interview. Coke said in its quarterly earnings for the January-March 2018 quarter that it has had three quarters of growth on the back of better distribution and portfolio expansion.The maker of Thums Up, Minute Maid juice and Kinley water has been stepping up launches in the ‘healthier’ space including no-sugar variants of Coke, Sprite and Thums Up, Vio dairy drink, Zico coconut water, Aquarius fortified water, Fuze iced tea, glucose and fruit juice drink Aquarius Glucocharge and Minute Maid Vitingo for micronutrient deficiency and malnutrition, besides hyperlocal variants of juices and juice-based drinks.“As a matter of policy we do not comment on any speculative news,” said a Coca-Cola spokesperson. “At this point there is nothing to report on the said matter. We will keep you informed of developments if any.”Both Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo, which sell a combined $100 billion a year in drinks and snacks, have tried to reduce reliance on soda and other aerated drinks by acquiring new products, particularly in faster growing drinks categories such as water or tea.In recent years Coca-Cola globally bought or invested in millennial friendly brands such as Honest Tea, an organic tea brand, Suja Life, a cold pressed juice maker, and AdeS, a soyabased beverage brand.However, another top official said buying Horlicks wouldn’t be the ideal fit for a company which is looking to rapidly reduce sugar across its portfolio.GSK Consumer’s Horlicks and Boost brands have strong positioning in Indian market and command approximately 70% of overall value market share in Indian Malted Food Drinks (MFD) market.These products had a combined revenue of £550 million in 2017, with India contributing most of it. However, in March the company decided to review and potentially sell the nutrition products business to fund the $13-billion buyout of Novartis’ stake in a consumer healthcare JV.The review will also include an assessment of the parent’s 72.5% stake in GSK Consumer in India. The current market cap of the company is Rs 25,544.95 crore.The outcome of this review is likely by end-2018 which may or may not result in any transaction, eventually, as per the company. Morgan Stanley and Greenhill are advising GSK in the sale.INDIA PLAY India is Horlick’s biggest market and even though the transaction is being run out of London from GSK’s headquarters, it will have significant India implications. A diverse set of suitors like Nestle, Danone, Mondelez, Abott and HUL are in fray as are PE buyout funds like KKR. Indian companies like ITC and even Dabur are believed to have evinced interest.The past few years have been fairly challenging for GSK Consumer. While a part of this was due to a tough macro, there were also company-specific issues like lack of aggression, delays in competitive responses and modest launches. Analysts also believe that brands Horlicks and Boost have been under-leveraged, evident from the near 95% of revenue from malted food drinks and the rest from biscuits and others.“Confluence of headwinds like demonetisation/ GST further impacted growth in the past few quarters,” feel Vivek Maheshwari and Bhavesh Shah, analysts with CLSA.“The management has been very slow to react on competition in India, evident from late retaliation to Abbott’s Pediasure.Similarly, despite rich heritage of Horlicks and Boost, MFD still accounts for over 95% of the revenues for the India and the company has hardly been successful in extending it to adjacent categories.”For companies such as Danone, HUL, ITC and Abbott, GSK’s consumer division looks pretty much in line with their product portfolio and could be the best strategic fit. KKR last year bought Unilever's global spreads business for $8 billion and looks at Horlicks as a possible extension for that business.Though the milk food category has been declining over the past three years because of alternate milk additives such as syrups flooding retail shelves, Horlicks still dominates the segment with 44% share and any new player will get an immediate captive market in the health-nutrition space.“We believe that given the expected growth of health drinks in India and dominant position of Horlicks, competitors would be keen on the asset at a premium. GSK Consumer has undertaken various initiatives like sachet and small pack units to aid penetration and affordability and campaigns towards benefits of health food drinks to drive performance.Further, for the premium hi-science products, the company is strengthening distribution in the chemist and pharmacy channels,” IIFL wrote in a recent note.", "page_url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/coca-cola-plans-to-boost-muscle-with-horlicks-buy/articleshow/64741264.cms", "page_id": "Economictime_PL_3905_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "GSK Consumer’s Horlicks and Boost brands have strong positioning in Indian market and command approximately 70% of overall value market share in Indian Malted Food Drinks (MFD) market.", "id": "Economictime_PL_3905_News_0", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-64741290,width-300,imgsize-62486,,resizemode-4,quality-100/horlicks.jpg"}, {"caption": "g14", "id": "Economictime_PL_3905_News_1", "src": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-64741265,quality-100/g14.jpg"}]}
