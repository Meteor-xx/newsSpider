{"title": "Afghan couple sues US Marine accused of abducting orphan baby girl evacuated during withdrawal: report", "body": "An Afghan couple who came to the U.S. following the chaotic withdrawal of American troops from the country in August 2021 filed a new lawsuit accusing a Marine of kidnapping after the service member and his wife had finalized the adoption of a baby girl whose biological parents were killed in a raid on an alleged terrorist compound. The girl, now 3 ½ years old, arrived at an airport in Washington, D.C., with a newlywed Afghan couple, purportedly the child’s cousin and pregnant wife, last summer. Five days later, Joshua Mast, a U.S. Marine Corps lawyer, took the girl away to live with him and his wife, Stephanie, in rural Virginia, according to a federal lawsuit filed in September. The suit accuses the Masts of false imprisonment, conspiracy, fraud and assault. But in rural Virginia court, Joshua Mast several months before had already finalized the adoption of the girl, who U.S. troops pulled from the rubble after attacking a remote compound on Sept. 6, 2019. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_8_News_0>The Associated Press first reported on the case on Thursday, citing hundreds of pages of legal filings and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The legal battle has drawn in the departments of Defense, Justice and State, over concerns about how it could significantly harm military and foreign relations.No details about September 2019 attack are publicly available, but in court documents Mast claims that classified reports show the U.S. government \"sent helicopters full of special operators to capture or kill\" a foreign fighter. Mast said that rather than surrender, a man detonated a suicide vest; five of his six children in the room were killed, and their mother was shot to death while resisting arrest.At just two months old, the baby suffered a fractured skull, broken leg and serious burns and was rushed to a U.S. military hospital, where she was placed in the custody of the Department of Defense. Sehla Ashai and Maya Eckstein, attorneys for the Afghan couple, dispute Mast’s account. They say the baby’s parents were farmers, unaffiliated with any terrorist group, and the attack left two civilians and five of their children dead.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_8_News_1>Mast, on temporary assignment in Afghanistan working as a military lawyer, said, he was \"aggressively\" advocating to get the child to the U.S. Over several months, he wrote to then-Vice President Mike Pence’s office. He said his colleagues in the military tried to talk to former President Donald Trump about the baby during a Thanksgiving visit to Bagram Airfield. Mast also said he made four requests over two weeks to then-White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, asking for help to medically evacuate the baby. About six weeks after the baby was rescued, the U.S. Embassy called for a meeting, attended by representatives of the Red Cross, the Afghan government and the American military, including Mast. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_8_News_2>The State Department communicated its position: Under international humanitarian law, the U.S. was obliged to do everything possible to reunite the baby with her next of kin, according to the AP. Later, the Masts petitioned the local Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court halfway around the world — in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia, where they lived. In early November 2019, a judge granted them legal custody. A few days later, a certificate of foreign birth listed Joshua and Stephanie Mast as parents.In December 2020, the state court granted the Masts a final adoption order based on the finding that the child \"remains up to this point in time an orphaned, undocumented, stateless minor.\" But when the child was five months old, the Red Cross said they’d found her biological family. In late 2019, Afghan officials told the U.S. Embassy that the baby’s paternal uncle had been identified, and he decided his son and daughter-in-law were best suited to take her, according to court records.Mast expressed doubts about the newly-found uncle, describing him in court records as \"an anonymous person of unknown nationality\" and claiming that turning the baby over to him was \"inherently dangerous.\" But the girl was placed in the couple’s Afghanistan home, where they say she was treated like their own daughter. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_8_News_3>In emails to a U.S. military office requesting evacuation, Mast alleged that he read more than 150 pages of classified documents, and concluded the child was a \"stateless minor.\" According to court records, Mast believed she was the daughter of transient terrorists who are citizens of no country. He also speculated that if reunited with her family, she could be made a child soldier or a suicide bomber, sold into sex trafficking, hit in a U.S. military strike, or stoned for being a girl. His attorney argued no DNA test was done to confirm the Afghan couple’s relation to the girl. When Taliban fighters began to quickly seize control of the country, Mast eventually began communicating with the couple, applying for visas for them to escort the child out of the country. In the summer of 2021, the Afghan couple and girl were eventually flown to Germany for the stopover, where Mast and his wife met them for the first time. The Masts wanted the girl to travel separately to the U.S. with them, but the Afghan couple refused. When the Afghan couple arrived at the airport in D.C. in late August 2021, Mast pulled them out of the international arrivals line and led them to an inspecting officer, according to the lawsuit. Mast presented a passport for the child with his own last name on it – allegedly to the Afghan couple’s surprise. The Afghan couple requested to go to Fort Pickett, where thousands of Afghan refugees were being temporarily house. That’s where a social worker told them the Masts were the girl’s legal guardian and the child was taken away.The fate of the Afghan child is now being debated in secret proceedings in a locked courtroom in the village of Palmyra, Virginia, home to about 100 people, according to the AP. The Afghan couple now lives in Texas, and the wife, who gave birth to a baby girl of her own since, says she is still devastated and planned on raising the girls as sisters though they have never met.

{"title": "US poised for slowdown in high-end munitions deliveries to Ukraine", "body": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signaled this week that the U.S. and its Western allies are having trouble keeping pace with Ukraine’s demand for the advanced weaponry it needs to fend off Russia’s invasion. That signal reflects dwindling supplies for Ukraine and fear in the White House of escalation that could lead to war between the U.S. and Russia.The risk of reduced U.S. stockpiles of high-end munitions has been reported almost since the U.S. began contributing to Ukraine’s defense. Now, nearly eight months since the start of the war, experts interviewed by Fox News Digital say the U.S. is at or very near the end of its capacity to give. They agreed that Austin’s remarks indicate that the initial rush of high-end munitions like HIMAR rocket launchers, Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft Stingers and M-777 Howitzers is over. These sources said there may be two factors at play that are contributing to this reality.One factor is the issue that Austin addressed directly this week – the U.S. is running low on equipment that it can hand over to Ukraine.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_0>At a press conference Wednesday, Austin was asked whether the U.S. and other nations are worried about running so low on domestic supplies of critical munitions that they can no longer help Ukraine. Austin dodged the question by stressing that the desire is there to get Ukraine what it needs, but he left unsaid whether Ukraine’s allies can actually deliver.\"Well, it certainly is not a question of lack of will,\" Austin replied.Austin had just concluded a meeting with officials from dozens of countries about Ukraine’s munitions needs. As he described that meeting, he again talked about willpower but hinted at strained capacity to provide more for Ukraine, which is using up munitions faster than the world can deliver them.\"We will produce and deliver these highly effective capabilities over the course of the coming months — and in some cases years — even as we continue to meet Ukraine’s most pressing self-defense requirements in real time,\" Austin said of the most recent commitment to send HIMARS, vehicles, radar systems and other equipment.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_1>Mark Cancian is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic & International Studies who spent seven years working on DOD procurement issues for the Office of Management and Budget. His assessment based on inventory levels, industrial capacity, and information from the Biden administration is that the U.S. has \"limited\" supplies of HIMARs, Javelins, Stingers and M-777 Howitzers.\"There are some areas where we’re basically at the bottom of the barrel,\" he told Fox News Digital.In some cases, this means the U.S. will likely start meeting Ukraine’s request for weaponry by sending over lower-end substitutions, such as lighter Howitzers that are serviceable but not what Ukraine is after. In other cases, the U.S. may not have much to give – Cancian said that while there is talk of the U.S. providing more air defense equipment, there is not much the U.S. can give in that area.Cancian said he reads Austin comments as a sign that the days of the U.S. giving Ukraine its best stuff are gone.\"It confirmed what I believe, that we will continue support Ukraine, but we’re going to have to do it in different ways, like providing substitutes, or we might have to buy stuff from other people, or it will take longer,\" he said. \"That it won’t be quite the same.\"He said this runs the risk of creating what he called a \"petting zoo of NATO equipment\" in Ukraine – relatively small numbers of many types of equipment that could create compatibility issues.Some on Capitol Hill are reading Austin’s remark differently that leads to largely the same result – that the Biden administration is purposefully slowing down the transfer of critical munitions to Ukraine, because it is increasingly worried about stumbling into a direct conflict with Russia.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_2>A congressional aide with working knowledge of these issues told Fox News Digital that while officials are hinting at limited supplies, there is still room to give more, and that the slowdown is because of a different calculation the Biden administration is making.\"They are afraid of escalation,\" this aide said.Just last week, President Biden openly talked about the \"Armageddon\" scenario that could unfold if Russia tried to win the war with a tactical nuclear strike. The congressional aide interpreted Austin’s remarks as a sign the administration is more and more worried about crossing a line that might force that outcome.Another sign of U.S. caution, the aide said, is that the administration allowed nearly $2.8 billion in authority to supply Ukraine with weapons to expire a few weeks ago, at the end of fiscal year 2022. Some on Capitol Hill are reading that as an indication that the administration is finding its own comfort level when it comes to arming Ukraine, and that level stops short of what Congress authorized.\"Congress gave the administration more than it wanted,\" the aide said. The Defense Department declined to respond to questions from Fox News Digital about the expiration of this authority.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_3>There is a related view within Congress that while U.S. stocks of certain munitions have clearly been reduced as the U.S. sends items to Ukraine, that reduction is not a security threat to the United States itself. The aide explained that many of these items were stockpiled largely for use in a possible conflict with Russia, and that conflict is already playing out with Ukraine in the lead.That conflict is reducing Russia’s military capacity, which means a corresponding drop in U.S. inventories is not putting the U.S. anywhere near a stockpile crisis.To put it another way: the Biden administration has more flexibility to give Ukraine more but is choosing not to.The evolving U.S. posture comes just as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is intensifying pressure on Western nations to provide more weapons. Just this week, Zelenskyy asked for air defense systems that can blunt Russia’s recent missile attacks on Ukraine’s capital.\"The 229th day of full-scale war,\" he said. \"On the 229th day, they are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//politics/us-signals-slowdown-high-end-munitions-deliveries-ukraine", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In this photo released by Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy leads a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 30, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/AP22273518758447-e1664548705779.jpg"}, {"caption": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin testifies before a House subcommittee in Washington, D.C., on May 11, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/Lloyd-Austin.png"}, {"caption": "Photo of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Biden", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/joe-biden-Zelensky.jpg"}, {"caption": "Destroyed Russian armored vehicles left behind by the Russian forces in Izium, Kharkiv, Ukraine on Oct. 2, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_63_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/ukraine-destroyed-tank.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Putin: Call-up of Russian reservists to finish in 2 weeks", "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he expects a mobilization of army reservists he ordered last month to bolster his country's troops in Ukraine to be completed in two weeks.Putin told reporters after attending a summit in Kazakhstan that 222,000 of the 300,000 reservists the Russian Defense Ministry said would get called up have been mobilized. A total of 33,000 of them are already in military units and 16,000 are involved in combat, he said.The call-up, announced by Putin in September, has proved hugely unpopular in Russia, where almost all men under the age of 65 are registered as reservists. At the same time, the Kremlin has faced domestic criticism of its handling of the war, increasing pressure on Putin to do more to turn the tide in Russia’s favor.The Russian leader initially described the mobilization as \"partial\" and said only those with combat or service experience would be drafted. However, a decree he signed outlined almost no specific criteria.Russian media reports have described attempts to round up men without the relevant experience, including those ineligible for service for medical reasons. In the wake of the president's mobilization order, tens of thousands of men left Russia.Putin also said Friday there was no need for more widespread attacks against Ukraine, such as those Russia launched Monday in retaliation for an Oct. 8 truck bomb explosion on a prized bridge linking Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.The Kerch Bridge explosion followed Ukraine’s recapturing of occupied areas in the country’s east and south in continuing counteroffensives that have restored Ukrainian confidence and embarrassed Russia's military.Russia has promised free accommodation to residents of Ukraine's partially occupied Kherson region who want to evacuate to Russia, a sign that Ukrainian military gains along the war's southern front are worrying the Kremlin.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_71_News_0>The Moscow-installed leader of Kherson, one of four regions illegally annexed by Putin last month, asked the Kremlin to organize an evacuation from four cities, citing incessant shelling by Ukrainian forces.Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Moscow-appointed regional administration, said a decision was made to evacuate Kherson residents to the Russian regions of Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol, as well as to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\"We, residents of the Kherson region, of course know that Russia doesn’t abandon their own, and Russia always offers a hand,\" Saldo said Thursday.Russia has characterized the movement of Ukrainians to Russia or Russian-controlled territory as voluntary, but in many cases those are the only evacuation routes residents of occupied areas can or are allowed to take.Reports have surfaced that some Ukrainians were forcibly deported to \"filtration camps\" with harsh conditions. In addition, an Associated Press investigation found that Russian officials deported thousands of Ukrainian children - some orphaned, others living with foster families or in institutions - to be raised as Russian.The evacuation announcement came as Ukrainian forces pushed deeper into the Kherson region, albeit at a slower pace than a few weeks ago. Ukrainian forces reported retaking 75 populated places in the region in the last month, Ukraine's Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said late Thursday night.A similar campaign in eastern Ukraine resulted in most of the Kharkiv region returning to Ukrainian control, as well as parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the ministry said.Putin illegally annexed Kherson, as well as the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine last month following \"referendums\" in the four regions that Kyiv and the West denounced as a sham.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_71_News_1>Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, the commander of Ukraine's armed forces, vowed Friday that his forces would succeed in \"getting ours back.\"\"No one and nothing will stop us,\" Zaluzhny said in a video message. \"We have buried the myth of the invincibility of the Russian army.\"While reiterating calls for local residents to evacuate to Russia, Saldo's deputy, Kirill Stremousov, also insisted the evacuation preparations did not mean the Russian-installed officials anticipated Ukrainian forces taking all of the Kherson region.\"No one’s retreating. ... No one is planning to leave the territory of the Kherson region,\" he said.For a fifth day, Russia continued missile strikes on critical infrastructure that started Monday in retaliation for an explosion on the Kerch Bridge last weekend that Moscow has said was caused by a truck bomb. The span, which links Crimea to the Russian mainland, holds important strategic and symbolic value to Russia in its faltering war in Ukraine.In the last 24 hours, at least nine civilians were killed and 15 were wounded, the Ukrainian president’s office reported Friday morning. The victims included an 11-year-old boy and six other people who died after a missile strike in the city of Mykolaiv, where a residential building was destroyed, the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said.Russian forces on Friday carried out at least four missile strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second- largest city. Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported several explosions in the northeastern city without offering any details on the extent of the damage or saying if there were any casualties.The Ukrainian army recaptured most previously occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, which includes the city of the same name, during a fierce counteroffensive last month that forced Russian troops to withdraw and inflicted a stunning blow on Moscow’s military prestige.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_71_News_2>The region's governor, Oleh Syniehubov, urged residents not to ignore air raid sirens and to get to bomb shelters. Earlier Russian strikes on Thursday night cut off the electricity in the regional capital, which had a pre-war population of 1.4 million.Multiple Russian missile strikes shook the city of Zaphorizhzhia overnight. The capital of the annexed region remains in Ukrainian hands and has come under repeated bombardment as Ukraine pushes its southern counteroffensive.Several explosions were reported overnight at infrastructure facilities, causing fires, regional Gov, Oleksandr Starukh said. There were no victims in preliminary reports, and further details about specific damage were unavailable.Starukh told Ukrainian state television that Russian soldiers remained unable to enter the city but their \"missiles remind us of the evil and grief that the army of the occupiers carries.\"In addition to the missile strikes on the regional capital, there was also shelling in three cities closer to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. In Nikopol, Marhanets, Chervonohryhorivka, drone and artillery strikes destroyed residential buildings and damaged water supply and power lines.The regional capital is about 100 miles by road from the plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Two days ago, it was forced to revert to diesel-fueled generator power to maintain its reactor cooling systems after an Russian missile attack on distant electrical substation.Friday is Defender’s Day in Ukraine, but celebrations were muted because of the war. In Kyiv, a concert at the central opera house was canceled because of planned, rotating power outages across the city as repairs to the city’s energy infrastructure continue following Russia's wide-ranging missile attacks.Missile, drone and rocket attacks on Ukraine have kept the country on edge with air raid sirens occurring more frequently and bringing a heightened sense of urgency after Monday’s strike killed 19 people and wounded more than 100, including many in the capital.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_71_News_3>Putin has vowed to retaliate harshly if Ukraine or its allies strike Russian territory, including the annexed regions of Ukraine. Russian officials reported Friday that Ukrainian shelling blew up an ammunition depot in Russia’s Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine.An unspecified number of people were killed and wounded in the incident, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee. Unconfirmed media reports said three Russian National Guard officers were killed and more than 10 were wounded.The Kerch Bridge explosion temporarily halted rail and road traffic on the 12-mile span, undermining a vital supply route for the Kremlin’s forces. The Russian government said Friday that repairs were scheduled to be completed by July 2023.Also on Friday, a court in Simferopol, the second-largest city in Crimea, formally arrested and placed five suspects in pre-trial detention in connection with the explosion, according to Russian news agency Interfax.Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) stated on Wednesday that it had identified 12 suspects involved in the explosion. The FSB reported the involvement of Ukrainian, Armenian and Russian citizens in what it described as a \"terrorist act\".", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/putin-call-up-russian-reservists-finish-2-weeks", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_71_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In this image taken from video released by the Russian Investigative Committee, employees of the Russian Investigative Committee work at the scene of a damaged part of the Crimean Bridge connecting Russian mainland and Crimean peninsula over the Kerch Strait, near Kerch, Crimea, Saturday, Oct. 8, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_71_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/Kerch-Russia-Crimea-Bridge-Explosion.jpg"}, {"caption": "A Ukrainian soldier looks out from a tank, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in the frontline city of Lyman, Donetsk region, Ukraine April 28, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_71_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/2022-09-30T123422Z_1232922033_RC28WT9WT23A_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-LYMAN-ENCIRCLE-e1664622348961.jpg"}, {"caption": "Armed National Guard servicemen walk along a trench at one of the sections of a defence line outside Kharkiv, Kharkiv Region, northeastern Ukraine.

{"title": "North Korea fires missile, artillery shells, inflaming tensions", "body": "North Korea fired a ballistic missile and hundreds of artillery shells toward the sea Friday and flew warplanes near the tense border with South Korea, further raising animosities triggered by the North’s recent barrage of weapons tests.The North Korean moves suggest it is reviving an old playbook of stoking fears of war with provocative weapons tests before it seeks to win greater concessions from its rivals.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement the short-range missile lifted off from the North’s capital region at 1:49 a.m. Friday (1649 GMT Thursday; 12:49 p.m. EDT Thursday) and flew toward its eastern waters.It was North Korea’s 15th missile launch since it resumed testing activities Sept. 25. North Korea said Monday its recent missile tests were simulations of nuclear strikes on South Korean and U.S. targets in response to their \"dangerous\" military exercises involving a U.S. aircraft carrier.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_75_News_0>Soon after the latest missile test, North Korea fired 130 rounds of shells off its west coast and 40 rounds off its east coast. The shells fell inside maritime buffer zones the two Koreas established under a 2018 inter-Korean agreement on reducing tensions, South Korea’s military said.On Friday afternoon, South Korea’s military said North Korea fired 80 additional shells off its east coast. It said it also detected signs of about 200 other North Korean artillery launches off its west coast, citing firing sounds and splashes. In both coasts, the North Korean shells were believed to have landed in the buffer zones again, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff.Observers said it was North Korea’s third and most direct violation of the 2018 agreement, which created buffer zones and no-fly areas along their land and sea boundaries to prevent accidental clashes. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it earlier sent North Korea a message asking it not to violate the agreement again.North Korea separately flew warplanes, presumably 10 aircraft, near the rivals’ border late Thursday and early Friday, prompting South Korea to scramble fighter jets. There were no reports of clashes between the two countries. It was reportedly the first time that North Korean military aircraft have flown that close to the border since 2017.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_75_News_1>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said North Korea’s provocations are becoming \"indiscriminative’\" but that his country has massive retaliation capabilities that can deter actual North Korean assaults to some extent.\"The decision to attack can’t be made without a willingness to risk a brutal outcome,\" Yoon told reporters. \"The massive punishment and retaliation strategy, which is the final step of our three-axis strategy, would be a considerable psychological and social deterrence (for the North).\"South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said Friday it imposed sanctions on 15 North Korean individuals and 16 organizations suspected of involvement in illicit activities to finance North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. They were Seoul’s first unilateral sanctions on North Korea in five years, but observers say they are largely a symbolic step because the two Koreas have little financial dealings between them.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters he supports South Korea’s decision to impose the sanctions.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_75_News_2>Most of the North’s recent weapons tests were ballistic missile launches that are banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions. But the North hasn’t been slapped with fresh sanctions thanks to a divide at the U.N. over U.S. disputes with Russia regarding its invasion of Ukraine and with China over their strategic competition.The missile launched Friday traveled 650-700 kilometers (403-434 miles) at a maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (30 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, according to South Korean and Japanese assessments.\"Whatever the intentions are, North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile launches are absolutely impermissible and we cannot overlook its substantial advancement of missile technology,\" Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said.The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan remains \"ironclad.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_75_News_3>Other recent North Korean tests included a new intermediate-range missile that flew over Japan and demonstrated a potential range to reach the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam; long-range cruise missiles; and a ballistic missile fired from an inland reservoir, a first for the country.After Wednesday’s cruise missile launches, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear forces were fully prepared for \"actual war to bring enemies under their control at a blow\" and vowed to expand the operational realm of his nuclear armed forces, according to North Korea’s state media.Some observers had predicted North Korea would likely temporarily pause its testing activities this week in consideration of its ally China, which is set to begin a major political conference Sunday that is expected to give President Xi Jinping a third five-year term as party leader.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular briefing Friday that all related countries should work to prevent tensions from escalating and move toward restarting meaningful talks.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_75_News_4>North Korea’s ongoing testing spree is reminiscent of its 2017 torrid run of missile and nuclear tests that prompted Kim and then-U.S. President Donald Trump to exchange threats of total destruction. Kim later abruptly entered high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump in 2018 but their negotiations fell apart a year later due to wrangling over how much sanctions relief Kim should be provided in return for a partial surrender of his nuclear capability.Kim has repeatedly said he has no intentions of resuming nuclear diplomacy. But some experts say he would eventually want to win international recognition of his country as a nuclear state and hold arms control talks with the United State to wrest extensive sanctions relief and other concessions in return for partial denuclearization steps.The urgency of North Korea’s nuclear program has grown since it passed a law last month authorizing the preemptive use of nuclear weapons over a broad range of scenarios, including non-war situations when it may perceive its leadership as under threat.Most of the recent North Korean tests were of short-range nuclear-capable missiles targeting South Korea. Some analysts say North Korea’s possible upcoming nuclear test, its first bomb detonation in five years, would be related to efforts to manufacture battlefield tactical warheads to be placed on such short-range missiles.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_75_News_5>These developments sparked security jitters in South Korea, with some politicians and scholars renewing their calls for the U.S. to redeploy its tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea as deterrence against intensifying North Korean nuclear threats.North Korea’s military early Friday said it took unspecified \"strong military countermeasures\" in response to South Korea’s artillery fire for about 10 hours near the border on Thursday.

Viewers were also given new revelations about the nearly 16-month congressional inquiry.Below are five of the biggest moments from the committee's latest hearing:<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_0>The nine members of the committee, seven Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans, voted unanimously to compel the former president to testify about his conduct leading up to and during the attack.\"This is a question about accountability to the American people,\" said committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. \"He's required to answer to those millions of Americans whose votes he tried to throw out as part of his scheme to remain in power.\"Trump has previously refused to voluntarily cooperate with the panel, calling it a partisan witch hunt.Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for former President Donald Trump, responded on social media by saying that Democrats were engaged in \"partisan theatrics.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_1>\"Today, 26 days before the Midterm Elections, America is truly a nation in decline. Inflation is out of control, the crime rate is at an all time high, and the crisis at our southern border has never been worse,\" Budowich wrote in a tweet. \"However, instead of using their final days in power to make life for Americans any better, Democrats are doubling and tripling down on their partisan theatrics.\"Budowich added, \"Pres Trump will not be intimidate[d] by their meritless rhetoric or un-American actions. Trump-endorsed candidates will sweep the Midterms, and America First leadership & solutions will be restored. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\"We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion,\" said committee member , R-Wyo. \"Every American is entitled to those answers, so we can act now to protect our republic.\"Trump could fight the subpoena, which likely would tip off a legal fight with just over two months left in the current Congress — a very short time frame for such a major legal dispute. If Republicans take over the House in the midterms, it's not expected they will continue the work of the Jan. 6 committee.Trump’s one-time campaign manager, Brad Parscale, reportedly told the committee that the former president planned as early as July 2020 to declare re-election victory in November.Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., claimed that Parscale had told the committee that Trump long planned a pre-emptive declaration of victory.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_2>\"In the course of our investigation, we also interviewed Brad Parscale, President Trump's former campaign manager. He told us he understood that President Trump planned as early as July that he would say he won the election even if he lost,\" said Lofgren.Members of the committee also played videos of Trump allies, including Steve Bannon and Roger Stone, arguing for a pre-emptive declaration of victory.In the wake of the 2020 election, Trump signed a memo ordering U.S. troops to withdraw from Afghanistan and Somalia, according to witnesses who testified before the Jan. 6 committee.Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said the order proved that Trump understood that he had lost the White House and was moving to wind down the U.S. troop presence abroad before President Biden took office.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_3>\"Knowing that he had lost and that he had only weeks left in office, President Trump rushed to complete his unfinished business,\" said Kinzinger. \"Knowing he was leaving office, he acted immediately and signed this order on Nov. 11th, which would have required the immediate withdrawal of troops from Somalia and Afghanistan — all to be complete before the Biden inauguration on Jan. 20th.\"Military witnesses said they believed that Trump's plan was highly reckless and would have been a debacle — just as President Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal turned out to be in August 2021.The committee did not detail why the order was never carried out.The committee played video of Democratic and Republican congressional leaders urging Trump and top administration officials to act immediately to quell the riot during the height of the attack.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., were both filmed demanding former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to implore Trump to make a statement urging the rioters to stop.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_4>Party leaders, including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., were also shown gathering around a phone asking federal and state officials for military help.Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., a member of the committee, said there were plans to recall witnesses who testified that Trump allegedly lunged at a Secret Service agent for refusing to drive him to the Capitol during the attack.\"After concluding its review of the voluminous additional Secret Service communications from Jan. 5th and Jan. 6th, the committee will be recalling witnesses and conducting further investigative depositions based on that material,\" said Aguilar.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_5>Earlier this year, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson recounted a conversation she had with ex-Trump deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato directly after Trump's rally in front of the Ellipse on Jan. 6.Hutchinson said Ornato told her that Trump tried to \"grab at the steering wheel\" then lunged at the Secret Service agent in charge at the time because the agent wouldn't drive Trump to the Capitol as the riot was taking place.A source close to Ornato told Fox News' David Spunt after Hutchinson's testimony that Ornato was shocked when Hutchinson made the allegation about the steering wheel. That source said both Ornato and Secret Service agent Robert Engel would be willing to testify to the committee to refute that part of Hutchinson's story.Aguilar said on Thursday that the committee was investigating potential \"obstruction\" of justice related to the allegation.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//politics/top-5-moments-from-latest-jan-6-hearing-before-midterm-elections-include-trump-subpoena-new-video", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Former President Donald Trump has previously refused to voluntarily cooperate with the Jan. 6 panel, calling it a partisan witch hunt.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1330458437.jpg"}, {"caption": "\"This is a question about accountability to the American people,\" said Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_82_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/AP22161026558407-e1654827536761.jpg"}, {"caption": "Trump’s one-time campaign manager, Brad Parscale, reportedly told the Jan. 6 committee that the former president planned to declare re-election victory as early as July 2020.

It was purchased by Ukranian celebrity Andriy Danylko, Out Magazine reported.

{"title": "Multiple explosions rock eastern Ukraine city of Kharkiv", "body": "A series of explosions rocked the eastern Ukraine city of Kharkiv early Saturday, sending towering plumes of illuminated smoke into the sky and triggering a series of secondary explosions.There were no immediate reports of casualties.The blasts came hours after Russia concentrated attacks in its increasingly troubled invasion of Ukraine on areas it illegally annexed, while the death toll from earlier missile strikes on apartment buildings in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia rose to 14.Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the early-morning explosions were the result of missile strikes in the center of the city. He said that the blasts sparked fires at one of the city's medical institutions and a nonresidential building.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_0>In a rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his conduct of Europe's worst armed conflict since World War II, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to human rights organizations in his country and Ukraine, and to an activist jailed in Russia's ally Belarus.Berit Reiss-Andersen, the committee's chair, said the honor went to \"three outstanding champions of human rights, democracy and peaceful coexistence.\"Putin this week illegally claimed four regions of Ukraine as Russian territory, including the Zaporizhzhia region that is home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, whose reactors were shut down last month.Fighting near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has alarmed the U.N.'s atomic energy watchdog, which on Friday doubled to four the number of its inspectors monitoring plant safeguards. An accident there could release 10 times more potentially lethal radiation than the world’s worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in Ukraine 36 years ago, Ukrainian Environmental Protection Minister Ruslan Strilets said Friday.\"The situation with the occupation, shelling, and mining of the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants by Russian troops is causing consequences that will have a global character,\" Strilets told The Associated Press.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_1>The U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, reported more trouble at the plant, saying Friday on Twitter that external power had again been cut off to one of Zaporizhzhia's shutdown reactors, necessitating the use of emergency backup diesel generators to run safety systems.The city of Zaporizhzhia is located 53 kilometers (33 miles) away from the nuclear plant as a crow flies and remains under Ukrainian control. To cement Russia's claim to the region, Russian forces bombarded the city with S-300 missiles on Thursday, with more attacks reported Friday.Ukrainian authorities said the death toll from the strikes on apartment buildings rose to 14 on Friday, while 12 people wounded in the bombardment remained hospitalized.Missiles also struck the city overnight, wounding one person, Zaporizhzhia Gov. Oleksandr Starukh said. Russia also used Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones there for the first time and damaged two infrastructure facilities, he said.With its army losing ground to a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south and east, Russia has deployed unmanned, disposable Iranian-made drones that are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but still can damage ground targets.The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Russia's use of the explosives-packed drones was unlikely to affect the course of the war.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_2>\"They have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas, likely hoping to generate nonlinear effects through terror. Such efforts are not succeeding,\" analysts at the think tank wrote.In other Moscow-annexed areas, Russia's Defense Ministry reported Friday that its forces had repelled Ukrainian advances near the city of Lyman and retaken three villages elsewhere in the eastern Donetsk region. The ministry also claimed that Russian forces had prevented Ukrainian troops from advancing on several villages in the southern Kherson region.Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Friday that this week alone, his military has recaptured 776 square kilometers (300 square miles) of territory in the east and 29 settlements, including six in the Luhansk region, which Putin has annexed. In total, Ukrainian forces have liberated 2,434 square kilometers (940 square miles) of land and 96 settlements since the beginning of its counteroffensive, he said.In Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, Russian troops shelled the city of Nikopol overnight, killing one person, wounding another and damaging buildings, natural gas pipelines and electricity systems, the governor reported. Nikopol lies along the Dnieper River across from Russian-held territory near the nuclear power plant. The city has been shelled frequently for weeks.The trail of Russia’s devastation and death from areas where its troops retreated became clearer Friday. A report by Ukrainian First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Yevhen Yenin revealed that 530 bodies of civilians have been found in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region since Sept. 7.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_3>The residents killed during the Russian occupation included 257 men, 225 women and 19 children, with 29 people unidentified, Yenin said. Most of the bodies were found in a previously disclosed mass grave in the city of Izium.According to Yenin, the recovered bodies bore signs of gunshots, explosions and torture. Some people had ropes around their necks, hands tied behind their back, bullet wounds to their knees and broken ribs.Authorities have identified 22 torture sites in parts of the Kharkiv region that Ukrainian forces recently liberated, said Serhiy Bolvinov, a regional police official.In recently recaptured Lyman, workers found 200 individual graves and a mass grave with an unknown number of victims, Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko reported on Telegram. In Sviatohirsk, 24 kilometers (15 miles) from Lyman, 21 bodies of civilians were reburied.Russian military equipment and weapons, meanwhile, is getting into Ukrainian hands. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Friday that Ukrainian forces have captured at least 440 tanks and about 650 armored vehicles since the Russian invasion started Feb. 24.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_4>\"The failure of Russian crews to destroy intact equipment before withdrawing or surrendering highlights their poor state of training and low levels of battle discipline,\" the British ministry said. \"With Russian formations under severe strain in several sectors and increasingly demoralized troops, Russia will likely continue to lose heavy weaponry.\"Putin ordered a partial mobilization of Russian army reservists last month to reinforce manpower on the front lines in Ukraine. Mistakes have dogged the military call-up, however, and tens of thousands of men have fled Russia, unwilling to fight Putin's war.That has left Russia desperate for troop reinforcements. The Ukrainian military said Friday that 500 former criminals have been mobilized to reinforce Russian ranks in the eastern Donetsk region, where Ukrainian forces have retaken territory. Law enforcement officers are commanding the new units, the military said.Russia's state news agency Tass reported Friday that a court in the Russian city of Penza had dismissed the first case against a Russian man called up to serve but who refused. The 32-year-old man's lawyers had argued that the law under which he was charged applies only to conscription evaders, not those subject to the partial mobilization.In another sign of trouble, reports have surfaced of poor training and few supplies for the new Russian troops. At least two Russian cities — St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod — announced Friday they were canceling their Russian New Year's and Christmas celebrations and redirecting that money to buy supplies for Russian troops.Under increasing pressure from his own supporters as well as critics, Putin continued to reshuffle his military’s leadership, replacing the commander of Russia’s eastern military district.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/multiple-explosions-rock-eastern-ukraine-city-kharkiv", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Smoke rises after big explosions in Kharkiv, Ukraine, early Saturday, Oct. 8, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/AP22280790223634.jpg"}, {"caption": "A Russian rocket sticks out of the ground in a forest near Oleksandrivka village, Ukraine, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/AP22279644337237.jpg"}, {"caption": "Locals receive food given by Ukrainian volunteers in the recently retaken village of Boguslavka village, east Ukraine, Friday, Oct. 7, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/AP22280637032169.jpg"}, {"caption": "A Russian flag lies on the ground of a partially damaged culture centre in the recently retaken village of Borova village, east Ukraine, Friday, Oct. 7, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/AP22280631912268.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ukrainian servicemen stand on top a Ukrainian tank near the recently retaken village of Borova, east Ukraine, Friday, Oct. 7, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_191_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/AP22280633261702.jpg"}]}

And the result of their disagreement could prompt a shift in U.S. policy, the lawmaker suggested.Musk, the founder of Telsa and CEO of SpaceX, offered a \"solution\" to the Russia-Ukraine War that included Ukraine handing over Crimea to Russia and Ukraine staying out of NATO, in return, Russia should quit any further militaristic invasion.The lawmaker disagreed.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_231_News_0>\"With all due respect to Elon Musk - and I do respect him - I would suggest he needs to understand the facts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\" Graham tweeted Wednesday.Musk, advocating for a more democratic approach, said the U.S. should respect the outcome of some referendum elections in Eastern Ukraine, which resulted in several Ukrainian regions voting to join Russia.Experts believed elections in four Ukrainian regions — where Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia voted to join Russia — were orchestrated by the Russian government and conducted by pro-Russia separatists.He said in a later tweet Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \"almost certainly do not want to join Russia\" but they were annexed by Russia \"to ensure a land bridge and water supply to Crimea.\"In February, Russia invaded Ukraine as President Vladimir Putin claimed Ukraine did not observe the results of similar elections in the eastern regions which similarly voted in Russia’s favor.\"Assuming you believe that the will of the people matters, we should, in any given conflict region, support the will of those who live there,\" Musk tweeted in response to the South Carolina Republican.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_231_News_1>Musk added: \"Most of Ukraine unequivocally wants to be part of Ukraine, but some eastern portions have Russian majorities and prefer Russia.\"The Tesla founder also provided an unsourced electoral map, which he suggested shows Eastern Ukraine’s interest in becoming Russian.A defiant Graham called Musk’s plan \"dumb\" and an \"affront\" to Ukraine’s defense of their country.\"Suggesting we end the Russian invasion by simply giving Russia parts of Ukraine - after all the suffering - is dumb,\" Graham tweeted. \"It is also an affront to the bravery of the Ukrainians fighting to defend their homeland.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_231_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_231_News_3>The senator also shared his own idea for a solution: Russia should observe the terms of their own 1994 agreement which included honoring the territorial integrity of Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, he said.Graham ended the debacle suggesting the U.S. should direct its attention to changing electric vehicle tax credit, which intends to allow more Americans to purchase electric vehicles, as it benefits the Musk-owned Tesla.\"While we’re at it, maybe the Congress should revisit the electric vehicle tax credit boondoggle. It is where the credit is now solely benefiting electric vehicle manufacturers who have increased prices equal to the tax credit!\" the lawmaker said.He added: \"It could be a good way to help save money by applying those funds to assisting Ukrainians in defending their homeland.\"The Kremlin previously expressed support for Musk's theoretical proposal.\"It is very positive that somebody like Elon Musk is looking for a peaceful way out of this situation,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Reuters.\"Compared to many professional diplomats, Musk is still searching for ways to achieve peace.

The pontiff also called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to \"be open\" to serious peace proposals.Francis told the public, gathered in St. Peter's Square, that he was abandoning his usual religious theme for his Sunday noon remarks to concentrate his reflection on Ukraine.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_288_News_0>\"How the war is going in Ukraine has become so grave, devastating and threatening that it sparks great worry,\" Francis said.\"In fact, this terrible, inconceivable wound of humanity, instead of shrinking, continues to bleed even more, threatening to spread,\" the pope said.\"I deplore strongly the grave situation created in the last days, with further actions contrary to the principles of international law,\" Francis said, in a clear reference to Putin's illegal annexation of a large swath of eastern Ukraine. \"It, in fact, increases the risk of a nuclear escalation, to the point of fearing uncontrollable and catastrophic consequences on the world level.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_288_News_1>\"Rivers of blood and tears spilled these months torment me,'' the pope said. \"I am pained by the thousands of victims, in particular among the children, and by so much destruction, that leaves many persons and families homeless and threatens vast territories with cold and hunger,'' he said.\"Certain actions can never be justified, never,'' the pope said. He didn't elaborate. But Putin sought to justify launching the invasion saying he needed to protect his country from what he called \"Nazi\" elements in Ukraine.\"It's anguishing that the world is learning the geography of Ukraine through names like Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol, Izium, Zaporizhizhia and other places, that have become places of indescribable sufferings and fears,'' Francis said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_288_News_2>\"And what to say about the fact that humanity finds itself again faced with atomic threat? It's absurd,'' Francis said, who then called for an immediate cease-fire.\"My appeal is directed above all to the president of the Russian Federation, imploring him to stop, also for the love of his people, this spiral of violence and death,'' Francis said. \"On the other side, pained by the immense suffering of the Ukrainian people following the aggression undergone, I direct a similarly trusting appeal to the president of Ukraine to be open to serious proposals of peace,'' Francis said.It is rare for the pope to single out leaders in his frequent appeals for an end to violent conflicts. In doing so, Francis signaled his extreme worry over the deteriorating situation.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_288_News_3>\"May arms cease and conditions be searched for to start negotiations able to lead to solutions not imposed by force but agreed upon, just and stable,'' Francis said. \"And they will be thus if they are based on respect for the sacrosanct value of human life, as well as on the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of every country, as well as the rights of minorities and of legitimate concerns.\"Invoking God’s name and the \"sense of humanity that lodges in every heart,\" he renewed his many pleas for an immediate cease-fire.Without elaborating, Francis also called for the \"recourse to all diplomatic instruments, including those so far possibly not utilized, to end this immense tragedy.\"\"The war itself is an error and a horror,'' the pontiff lamented.Throughout the war, Francis has denounced the recourse to arms. But recently, he stressed Ukraine's right to defend itself from aggression.

{"title": "North Korean defectors give rare glimpse into life inside Kim Jong Un’s regime", "body": "Life inside Kim Jong Un’s totalitarian regime is drastically different from the facade of strength and power the hermit kingdom projects to the outside world. Nobody knows that contrast quite like the North Korean defectors who have lived through and escaped from the most dangerous and closed off countries in the world. \"It's better to die than to live this way,\" a 25-year-old North Korean defector told Fox News in a café in Seoul, Korea. Speaking anonymously, she remarked on her \"aha\" moment — when her desperation led her to make the leap — to have a shot at a new life in a cosmopolitan city miles away. \"Regardless of the risk, life in North Korea was not worth it,\" she said. The defector, who escaped in 2019 at the age of 23, is among the many women who make the journey south. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_368_News_0>Years prior, when her mother escaped to China, she became a target for the regime. The government limited her job options and slashed her pay entirely. Her dreams of going to medical school and becoming a doctor were cut short. She was able to work as a nurse with no pay, getting by with money her mother sent from China. \"It's hard to survive,\" she said. \"A lot of the health problems that we see have reduced … [But] it's still a very prevalent issue, malnutrition.\"But the struggles that everyday North Koreans face are unrivaled to citizens sent to labor camps. \"They send the entire family into this concentration camp, and they make sure to put them on different work shifts, so the family is never reunited,\" she said. \"The whole purpose of this is to prevent people from escaping because they think that if one of the family members is at work, then they won't just leave the family member behind and leave.\"\"The main thing they do in these concentration camps is forced labor,\" she said. \"They only provide very basic education. So when young kids get sent to these concentration camps, they sort of educate until they are 13.\"North Koreans who are sent to camps are considered criminals by the government. However, it is crimes against the government that can land North Koreans in camps with the harshest conditions. Often, those sent to these camps will serve a life sentence. The defector said the government goes to great lengths to conceal the camps from the public eye.\"There was this one concentration camp that just disappeared overnight because they wanted to give a false image that it wasn't there,\" she said \"They moved all the people that were originally in the concentration camp elsewhere, and they made this facade of a small village. So they brought in like just regular coal miners to live there.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_368_News_1>This defector said she was determined not to make this situation her reality. Using the money she received from her mother in China, she was eventually able to pay smugglers to lead her to safety in South Korea through China.Working with advocates at an organization called PSCORE (People for Successful COrean Reunification) she is on track to graduate college and hopes to extend the non-profit’s mission to help defectors in Seoul. But not every defector is as lucky. North Korean defector and CEO of the non-profit Woorion Daehyeon Park offered this dire assessment: \"It is not about … surviving in South Korea. [North Korean defectors] are lost in life. They don't have the hope. They don't have a vision. They don't have anything to do in society,\" Park told Fox News Digital. \"Even though I can survive in South Korea and just like working and having your job doesn't make them happy and it is easy for them to you know … choose a dark path.\"Park started Woorion to meet the needs of the 33,834 defectors living in South Korea that are struggling to build their lives in a modern, high-tech society. Park says he can relate to defectors who say they feel transported to a new world.\"Imagine that I was still living in the 19th century, and at a certain point you cross the river, and you take [a] taxi … and I see the cities, and it’s just like I'm living in this … city of movies, one of the movies that I was just watching, and that was when I realized wow,\" Park said. \"The school system taught me that North Korea is the envy of the world, you know this is the best country in the world.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_368_News_2>Woorion helps defectors utilize the resources in the country that they have only seen in boot-leg western movies. According to the non-profit, 72% of defectors do not know where and how to find helpful information for their resettlement. \"They're not meant to come here to treat us as second-class citizens,\" Park said. Roughly one in three defectors are vocal about their experience and 93% of Woorion members say that the organization is an integral part of their lives. For families left behind, they often find little solace from non-governmental groups that are shut out from the isolated nation. Reunification is not the consensus of all South Koreans, despite calls from defectors and older generations who remember families torn apart during the Korean War. According to the Asian Institute for Policy Studies, \"from 2011-2017, about 25% of South Koreans in their 20s admitted they were not interested in unification.\"\"The majority of North Koreans are just innocent people, just like my mama, my dad, my whole entire family,\" said Park. \"I want them to have freedom.\"\"The younger generation … they don't trust the [North Korean] government as much,\" a 25-year old defector told Fox News Digital. \"They want change and they want radical change. And if this reunification will get them the change that they want, then they support it.\"Kim Tae-Hoon, the president of PSCORE and former deputy chair of the North Korean Human Rights Committee, told Fox News Digital that \"the only solution is to have the unification.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_368_News_3>\"The Korean people have a long history of the same race, the same culture for thousands of years, so it is natural for us,\" Tae-Hoon said. \"Even the North Korean regime and the North Korean people also believe that the unification is their duty.\"For those desiring unification, Beijing is viewed as one of its greatest obstacles. \"Geopolitical force is a very important effect. ... China doesn't want the unification of Korea,\" Tae-Hoon said. North Korea’s strong ties to China only add to those complexities as China repatriates North Koreans who try to escape from the grips of Kim Jong Un. Tae-Hoon argues that the will of the Korean people and knowledge of the western world will motivate the North Korean people to push for reform.\"There is hope that there can be change within the country,\" said Tae-Hoon. \"The North Korean people have this desire to know more.\"For most North Koreans unfettered access to social media and a free press is a world they do not know. But as more and more people escape, the world is getting a greater picture of a kingdom far removed from the rest of the world and its norms.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/north-korean-defectors-give-rare-glimpse-life-inside-kim-jong-uns-regime", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_368_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In this June 6, 2020 file photo, North Korean students stage a rally to denounce South Korea following that defectors and other activists in South Korea flew anti-Pyongyang leaflets over the border, at the Pyongyang Youth Park Open-air Theatre in Pyongyang, North Korea.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_368_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/12/AP20349522279646.jpg"}, {"caption": "North Koran defectors release balloons carrying leaflets condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his government's policies, in Paju, near the border with North Korea, South Korea on Oct. 10, 2014.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_368_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/north-korea-balloons-covid.jpg"}, {"caption": "North Korean soldiers looking toward the South at the DMZ.

{"title": "US contractor freed by Taliban in swap for drug trafficker", "body": "An American contractor held hostage in Afghanistan for more than two years has been released in exchange for a convicted Taliban drug lord jailed in the United States, the White House said Monday, announcing a rare success in U.S.-Taliban talks since the militant group took power a little more than a year agoMark Frerichs, a Navy veteran who had spent more than a decade in Afghanistan as a civilian contractor, was abducted in January 2020 and is believed to have been held since then by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. He was traded for Bashir Noorzai, a Taliban associate convicted in a heroin trafficking conspiracy who had spent 17 years behind bars before his release Monday.The exchange is one of the most significant prisoner swaps to take place under the Biden administration, coming five months after a deal with Russia that brought home Marine veteran Trevor Reed. Though his case has received less public attention than those of some other Americans held abroad, including WNBA star Brittney Griner and corporate security executive Paul Whelan — who are both held in Russia and whose relatives met with President Joe Biden on Friday — U.S. officials said the deal for Frerichs was the result of months of quiet negotiations.Those discussions gained new momentum in June when Biden agreed to grant Noorzai relief from his life sentence, setting the stage for what one administration official described as a \"very narrow window of opportunity this month\" to complete the deal.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_534_News_0>Biden said in a statement released by the White House, \"Bringing the negotiations that led to Mark’s freedom to a successful resolution required difficult decisions, which I did not take lightly.\"Frerichs, 60, had been working on civil engineering projects at the time of his Jan. 31, 2020 abduction in Kabul. He’s believed to have been lured into a meeting to discuss a new project and then transported to Khost, a stronghold of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network near the Pakistan border.He was last seen in a video posted last spring by The New Yorker in which he appeared in traditional Afghan clothing and pleaded for his release. He was accompanied Monday by the administration’s special presidential envoy for hostage affairs and was in stable health, a U.S. official said. His ultimate destination was not immediately clear, though a Qatari Foreign Ministry official said Frerichs would soon head from Doha to the U.S.A sister of Frerichs, who is from Lombard, Illinois, thanked U.S. officials who helped secure her brother's release.\"I am so happy to hear that my brother is safe and on his way home to us. Our family has prayed for this each day of the more than 31 months he has been a hostage. We never gave up hope that he would survive and come home safely to us,\" said a statement from the sister, Charlene Cakora.Noorzai, at the time of his 2005 arrest, hardly seemed an ideal recipient for presidential clemency. He'd been designated on a list reserved for some of the world's most prolific drug traffickers, and was prosecuted in Manhattan's federal court on charges that accused him of owning opium fields in Kandahar province and relying on a network of distributors who sold the heroin in New York.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_534_News_1>When he was sentenced to life imprisonment, the then-top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said Noorzai's \"worldwide narcotics network supported a Taliban regime that made Afghanistan a breeding ground for international terrorism.\"Monday's deal underscored the two sides to the Taliban’s approach to illegal drugs. In April, they announced a ban on harvesting the poppies that produce opium for making heroin -- an order that also outlawed the manufacture and transportation of narcotics. However, during the years-long Taliban insurgency, they reportedly made millions of dollars taxing farmers and middle men who moved their drugs outside Afghanistan.A senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the administration said the U.S. government now determined that Noorzai's release would \"not materially change any risk to Americans or fundamentally alter the contours of the drug trade there.\" Officials also took into account that Noorzai had spent 17 years in prison. They said it became clear from negotiations that releasing him would be necessary to get Frerichs home.At a press conference Monday, Noorzai expressed gratitude at seeing his \"mujahedeen brothers\" — a reference to the Taliban — in Kabul.\"I pray for more success of the Taliban,\" he added. \"I hope this exchange can lead to peace between Afghanistan and America, because an American was released and I am also free now.\"Even before their takeover of Afghanistan in August last year, the Taliban had demanded the U.S. release Noorzai in exchange for Frerichs. But there had been little public indication of Washington proceeding along those lines.Eric Lebson, a former U.S. government national security official who had been advising Frerichs' family, said in a statement that \"everything about this case has been an uphill fight.\" He criticized the Trump administration for having given away \"our leverage to get Mark home quickly by signing a peace accord with the Taliban without ever having asked them to return Mark first.''\"Mark’s family then had to navigate two administrations, where many people viewed Mark’s safe return as an impediment to their plans for Afghanistan,\" the statement said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_534_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_534_News_3><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_534_News_4><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_534_News_5><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_534_News_6>The collapse of the Western-backed Afghan government and takeover by the Taliban in August 2021 raised additional concern that progress in negotiations could be undone or that Frerichs could be forgotten. But his name was invoked last month when Biden was said by his advisers to have pressed officials to consider any risk posed to Frerichs by the drone strike in Afghanistan that killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.The Taliban-appointed foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, hailed the exchange Monday as the start of a \"new era\" in U.S.-Taliban relations and the opening of a \"new door for talks.\"U.S. officials were more circumspect. Though it does not recognize the Taliban government, the U.S. does have interests at stake in Afghanistan and will continue to engage with the Taliban in addressing the hunger and humanitarian crisis gripping the country, administration officials said Monday.But officials say they remain concerned about whether the Taliban are committed to fighting terrorism and by the exclusion of girls from high schools there, an issue that drew a United Nations reprimand on Sunday.___Faiez reported from Islamabad.

The government said the move would ensure continued oil production as the international community looks to cut its oil dependence on Russia.German’s Economy Ministry said Friday the companies will be put under the control of the Federal Network Agency.

{"title": "US-China experts warn of 'bloody affair for both sides' if war were to start", "body": "Any conflict between the U.S. and China would prove costly for both sides and resolve based on a few key points – and not necessarily in America’s favor, defense experts told Fox News Digital. \"If you were to rank them, I would put Taiwan first, South China Sea second, the Senkaku Islands third and then elsewhere in the world,\" James Anderson, the acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy during the Trump Administration, said, adding that the Sea of Japan could also serve as the flashpoint for conflict with China. President Biden, in May, reiterated this stance when he told a reporter that defending Taiwan, even militarily, was \"the commitment we made.\" Fox News Digital spoke with former defense officials and experts. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_570_News_0>Proximity to China would provide Beijing a significant advantage, similar to how Russia saw a swing in momentum during its Ukraine invasion once it shortened its supply lines to focus only on the territories just beyond its western border in the Donbas region.\"The problem is that in the Indo-Pacific Theater, the closer you get to China, the more [China] can concentrate its military assets,\" Anderson explained. \"What is especially concerning to the United States and its allies are ballistic missiles and the fact that China is probably ahead of us with hypersonic weaponry,\" which could allow China to hit jet carriers and other surface ships hard and fast. Even with that advantage though, China faces a significant conflict that Dr. John Lee, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former Senior National Security Advisor to Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, said would prove \"a very bloody affair for both sides.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_570_News_1>\"Over the past two decades, the U.S. and allies have been very passive, allowing the People’s Liberation Army to achieve air and sea dominance in this theater,\" Lee said. \"However, [they] are now becoming serious about developing long-range strike capabilities, hypersonic strike capabilities, asymmetrical capabilities … and the range of non-military measures which would include crippling economic and financial sanctions.\"\"In short, the U.S. and allies have many good and powerful options to ensure the military and strategic balance is in their favor,\" he added. Anderson also touted the U.S. military’s ability to counter missiles. However, that capability loses impact in the face of \"saturation attacks,\" which effectively aim to blanket a target with missiles and stretch defensive efforts. The U.S. has, therefore, also focused on trying to strengthen Taiwan through the \"porcupine strategy,\" which would see nations supply the island nation with a large amount of anti-tank and anti-air weaponry to help close the gap in military superiority that China holds. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_570_News_2>China holds a manpower advantage over the U.S., with China’s 2.8 million soldier army outranking the U.S. alone, according to Brookings Institution, but a naval and air combat operation would severely limit that advantage. \"At this stage, China has air and sea dominance over the Taiwan Strait but cannot land troops successfully on Taiwan,\" Lee said. \"If it achieves the capacity to do so, then China will see the military option as a more attractive one.\"Matt McInnis, of the Institute for the Study of War, noted that China’s goal will largely dictate its coordination and deployment: Any attempt to secure islands in the contested seas and straits would likely choke point the Chinese forces, leaving limited use for troop deployments. \"Depending on your objectives and what they aim to achieve through naval and air forces, you would potentially have some use for Marines to hold certain smaller pieces of territory and some smaller islands,\" McInnis said, adding that Beijing would only proceed with an invasion once it felt reasonably confident American forces could not deploy quickly enough to the region. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_570_News_3>Anderson noted that China has closed the gap in other military domains, but has not yet overtaken the U.S., acknowledging that China has \"the largest number of ships in the world today,\" but that the U.S. still has the advantage in terms of quality, and the same holds true for a \"superior\" U.S. Air Force. The U.S. also can rely on regional partners. China, on the other hand, has few allies to turn to, largely looking toward countries like Russia to help it \"deflect\" economic pressure that the U.S. and its allies, according to McInnis.\"There will certainly be economic lines of effort … and I'm quite sure China is looking long-term at how Russia as well as key energy suppliers like Iran, can help them manage economic fallout from a conflict with the United States,\" he said. \"But I don't think we're at the point in the relationship between countries, certainly including North Korea, where they would necessarily provide operational support or lethal aid directly to China.\"Lee believes that China’s position weakened since it tipped its hand and revealed \"broader intentions\" to \"dominate East Asia,\" a move that also has emboldened the U.S. and its allies to ensure they counter China’s ambitions. \"China seeks to prevail by convincing the US and allies that it is not ‘worth it’ to defend Taiwan, that the cost would be too great,\" he said. \"China’s problem is that it has revealed its broader intentions, which is to dominate East Asia: Hence, a successful Chinese seizure of Taiwan would embolden China to push further rather than lead to a more satisfied power.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/us-china-experts-warn-bloody-affair-both-sides-if-war-were-start", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_570_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "President Biden meets with China's President Xi Jinping during a virtual summit from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., Nov. 15, 2021.

{"title": "Benjamin Hall surprises Fox News colleagues with moving words six months after deadly Ukraine attack", "body": "Beloved Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall surprised colleagues on Wednesday with a special appearance at FOX News Media CEO Suzanne Scott’s quarterly address, where he insisted his devastating journey has been a story of goodwill, not tragedy.Hall’s surprise appearance came exactly six months after the tragic attack in Ukraine left him severely injured and killed Fox News photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra \"Sasha\" Kuvshynova. \"We were all amazed by his progress, inspired by his positive attitude and awed by his determination to recover. We are also working on a documentary for Ben to tell his story and to share the journey he has been on since the attack,\" Scott said. \"But really, who wants to wait for that? So, joining us now live from London is our very own Ben Hall.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_582_News_0>Hall, who recently reunited with his wife and three daughters after spending months at Brooke Army Medical Center, received a standing ovation from employees who attended the event in person. Hall then spoke to Fox News employees across the globe during the live, remote appearance. \"I think back to the last six months, and if I kept talking, I'd be here all day. But there are a couple of things which I really want to point out to everyone, and this opportunity to talk to the whole company is something that I've been looking forward to because I want to give everyone an update on my progress, on how far I've come and what has happened in that short space of just six months. But the fact is, is that six months ago out in Ukraine, we suffered from a terrible attack,\" Hall said. \"I remember thinking that day then when I was lying there that there was one thing I needed to do, and that was to get home, try somehow to get home and see my family. And what's happened from then to now with so much support, so much goodwill, so much help from everybody… I was helped by so many people and so many people at Fox News,\" Hall continued. \"And as I sit here, and I think of every single day, every single day of hard work that we all went through, I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to everyone who has got me through that.\" Hall thanked the heroes who saved his life and got him out of Ukraine and reunited with his family.\"It is a story, not really of tragedy, but one of goodwill,\" he said.The vehicle that Hall was traveling in, along with Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova, was struck by incoming fire in Horenka, outside Kyiv, while they were covering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The attack on Hall, Kuvshynova and Zakrzewski devastated Fox News and the journalism industry at large. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_582_News_1>Hall was rescued from the war zone in March and eventually transferred to a military medical facility in Texas, where he has undergone multiple surgeries. \"I think together, as we all continue to work, that's something we have to keep doing. I feel so proud to be part of the Fox News family. I really do. And I know that we couldn't have done it if we were alone. So, Suzanne, thank you. Thank you and [FOX News Media President Jay Wallace] for coming to see me down in hospital. It was little moments like that, that really helped me get through it and will continue to help me get through it. And I know we're going to keep doing it together,\" Hall said. The nonprofit organization Save Our Allies helped get Hall safely out of Ukraine. To extract Hall from the combat zone, the group worked with the Pentagon and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, along with the Polish and Ukrainian militaries. The effort on the ground was led by a \"special operations and intelligence veteran,\" the group revealed, as the team made sure Hall was stabilized and overseen by military medical personnel during the transport. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_582_News_2>Scott, along with FOX News Media President Jay Wallace, visited Hall earlier this year ahead of his 40th birthday and presented a birthday card from his colleagues.\"Ben, so great to see you again -- our trip down there was unbelievable. We've had some great conversations in the past six months,\" Wallace said during the quarterly address. \"I had the good fortune of working with Pierre. I did not have the chance or opportunity to work with Sasha. Do you want to tell everyone about them? They were amazing journalists in their own right.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_582_News_3>Hall was quick to praise his fallen colleagues, as he has done regularly since the horrific attack. \"When I think back to Sasha, I think of someone who worked so hard, who went like we did to try to find the stories. And she did that each and every day that we worked with her,\" he said. \"Sasha\" was just 24 years old and serving as a consultant, helping crews navigate Kyiv and the surrounding area while gathering information and speaking to sources. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_582_News_4>Zakrzewski, a Fox News legend who covered nearly every international story during a storied tenure, was only 55 years old. Last year, he played a key role in getting Afghan freelance associates and their families out of the country after the U.S. withdrawal. Only three months before his death, Zakrzewski was awarded the \"Unsung Hero\" award during the FOX News Media Spotlight Awards. It was later revealed that Hall was one of the many employees who previously had nominated Zakrzewski for the honor in 2021, months before his death. \"When I think of Pierre, this is someone who I traveled the world with, who many people at Fox News traveled with. To the tunnels of ISIS, to the front lines in Turkey, to the funerals and the great victories around the world, I was there alongside Pierre, and he taught us one thing, one thing that everyone needs to remember – that you must love this job, that you must fight every day to do it in the best way you possibly can,\" Hall said. \"Pierre had a smile on his face no matter where we went. He was absolutely the most incorrigible person I know, and I think that when we think back to both Pierre and Sasha, we have to remember what we can learn from them. That what we do, that this job is so important that we have to keep doing it. We have to keep doing it in their names. And if we do so, I think we can pay tribute to both of them.\"Scott thanked Hall for the \"beautiful words\" and for making the appearance. \"When you're ready to come back, we look forward to having you back. And we know it's been a long journey for you, but you look wonderful,\" Scott said, Hall quickly responded, \"I can't wait to be back.

During a court appearance by Hadi Matar, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt requested a protection order be placed for the witnesses and asked for an additional 70 days to present evidence to the defense, the Jamestown Post-Journal reported. He said the request stems from his office receiving more than 30,000 files of evidence from law enforcement agencies, the Erie Times-news reported.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_3>\"We total it to be 90 days from the arraignment,\" Schmidt said following a hearing Wednesday at Chautauqua County Court, the newspaper reported. \"We are required by statute to declare trial readiness by 90 days, otherwise a defendant can be discharged from the county jail.\"Fox News has reached out to the district attorney's office and the county public defender. Matar, who has pleaded not guilty, allegedly attacked Rushdie during an Aug. 12 lecture at the Chautauqua Institution education center. Schmidt reportedly noted that Matar may have been motivated by a $3 million bounty placed on Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran.The fatwa was issued after Rushdie authored \"The Satanic Verses,\" a book banned in Iran since 1988 and is considered blasphemous by some Muslims. \"There’s nothing that’s been provided to us to show that the Iranian government is actively supporting the attack on any supporters of Mr. Rushdie who may come forward to testify,\" Matar's public defender Nathaniel Barone said during his opposition to Schmidt's motion, according to the Post-Journal. Iran has denied any responsibility for the attack against Rushdie.A court hearing has been scheduled for Friday over the matter.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/salman-rushdie-stabbing-new-york-da-wants-witness-names-withheld-until-trial", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Hadi Matar, 24, center, arrives for an arraignment in the Chautauqua County Courthouse in Mayville, N.Y.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/hadi-matar.jpg"}, {"caption": "Salman Rushdie at a media appearance in New York.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AP22224568229540.jpg"}, {"caption": "Pakistani demonstrators protest Salman Rushdie in 2007.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-74844955-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this still image from video, author Salman Rushdie is taken on a stretcher to a helicopter for transport to a hospital after he was attacked during a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, N.Y.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_591_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/bc6d6983-AP22224580016117.jpg"}]}
{"title": "On 9/11 anniversary, I think about serving in Iraq and now Congress", "body": "Like most Americans, I will never forget where I was on Sept. 11, 2001. Having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, I worked for the commander of 12th Air Force overseeing our combat air forces west of the Mississippi River. As I was preparing to depart for work that day, the morning news reported that one of the Twin Towers was hit by an aircraft and was engulfed in flames. Within minutes, the second tower was struck, and it was clear the world had changed forever. We were now at war, and I knew that before sundown we’d be putting units on alert to join the coming fight. That horrific day changed the course of history. Our nation had been ruthlessly attacked by those who wished to change our way of life and instill fear. Like so many others, my heart was filled with resolve and a burning desire to serve. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_635_News_0>After 9/11, there was a national wave of patriotism and a call to service. Recruits started pouring in. Young Americans, enraged by the barbaric attack on our country, answered the call to put on the uniform, lace up their boots, and raise their right hand to fight our common enemy. Recalling those days, our nation had never felt so united and committed to a single purpose.  We were eager to fight to deliver justice to those who had murdered thousands of our citizens in cold blood. Ready to do all that our nation asked of us, no sacrifice was too small to destroy al Qaeda and make sure that America’s enemies could never again threaten our homeland.The years of the Global War on Terrorism were long and filled with heartache. Thousands of our nation’s precious sons and daughters served, fought, bled and died in America’s longest period of sustained combat. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_635_News_1>From 2002 to 2003, I had the privilege to command an EC-130H electronic combat squadron responsible for patrolling the skies over Iraq, protecting our forces from improvised explosive devices and other threats. Later, from 2007 to 2008, I served with Gen. David Petraeus on his staff in Baghdad. As the war took its toll, on more than one occasion, I had the solemn honor of sharing bitter tears with the parents and spouses of fallen airmen to explain how their loved one had given their young life for their country. I’ll never forget them or the intensity of their grief.As the years rolled by, the deployments kept coming, the long hours grew, and the losses mounted. Yet, despite the pain, we never lost hope or abandoned the conviction that we were fighting for something much bigger than ourselves. There was truly no other place I wanted to be, and no other job I would rather have than serving the United States in uniform.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_635_News_2>After nearly 30 years on active duty, I retired from the military and in 2017 was given the opportunity to continue my service in Congress. However, the war still raged, and the sacrifices continued. For me and other veterans in Congress, this only deepened our resolve to serve, and in the timeless words of Abraham Lincoln, \"to care for him who shall have born the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.\" The attack on 9/11 changed our nation forever and we will long carry the scars, both visible and invisible. Our chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year may have officially ended America’s longest conflict, but for many, particularly the women in Afghanistan and the interpreters that served by our side, the war goes on. For me, there is no greater honor – or responsibility – than to advocate for those who served, those who sacrificed, and for the families they left behind. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_635_News_3>As a member of the House Armed Services Committee and co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force and For Country Caucus of veterans in Congress, I am grateful for the opportunity to work closely with my colleagues across the political spectrum to craft policies to provide for the common defense, protect those who protect us, and honor the fallen and their families. As we reckon with the legacy of the 9/11 attacks, there is much work to do and no time to waste. The mission continues.As we mark the 21st anniversary of this fateful day, may we all live in gratitude for those who stand watch in the night so we may sleep peacefully, and for those who will follow.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//opinion/9-11-anniversary-serving-iraq-congress", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_635_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The annual Tribute in Light appears over lower Manhattan in New York City on Sept. 11, 2017 as seen from Jersey City, New Jersey.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_635_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/911.gary_.jpg"}, {"caption": "U.S. Army soldiers from 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, load their baggage as they begin their journey home after a deployment in Iraq, at Camp Virginia, Kuwait, Dec. 15, 2011.

Chmerkovskiy, who was born in Ukraine but is also a U.S. citizen, was in Ukraine earlier this year when Russia launched its invasion. The dancer was working as a judge on the Ukrainian version of \"Dancing with the Stars\" at the time. When the war first broke out in February, Chmerkovskiy documented his experience of being in Kyiv. He kept his fans and the world updated on his perspective, frequently going on Instagram Live to document what he was witnessing. \"When this whole thing happened. I wasn't, you know, trying to portray something or, you know, I had an agenda to social media gather or whatever it is,\" Chmerkovskiy explained to Fox News Digital. \"I was just little bit like, you know, there's no other way for me to say just to say … I'm terrified. You know, I'm … I want to go home, you know, this is insane. What are we doing?\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_681_News_0>He added that while most people have been in violent situations before, no one can imagine what living through a war is like because \"nobody is used to a wartime\" and that it might be \"hard to kind of fathom it a little bit because it doesn't make any sense for a regular person.\"The \"Dancing with the Stars\" alum also documented his travels out of war-torn Ukraine to Poland via train.He decided to leave after he was arrested on suspicion of being a Russian spy because he was unable to provide law enforcement with his proper documentation. He recalled being in fear for his life and feeling \"like no one was safe.\" \"Somebody grabbed me by the hand, and they suddenly — they pulled me into the building. And I was sort of under arrest because I wasn't able to present documentation right away,\" he said. \"I realized that it wasn't without a purpose. It was like they told me that last night, right underneath the hotel where I was, they found they located like a Russian spy cell … And so that's why, the next morning, everything was so heightened.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_681_News_1>Chmerkovskiy says he is often asked why he chose to flee rather than stay and defend his country.\"That's not my country. Very clear about that. In the United States for the better part of almost 30 years. And I'm proud of it,\" he said. \"It was very difficult for me to feel like I'm turning my back on Ukraine.\"He and his brother Val Chmerkovskiy were born in Ukraine but left in 1994 as teenagers after living through the country’s struggles after the fall of the Soviet Union. He said the latest experience brought back a lot of traumatic memories for him and his parents.Once reunited with his wife and son in Los Angeles, Chmerkovskiy started the charitable organization Baranova 27, named after the street he grew up on prior to his family’s decision to leave Ukraine. The organization has been gathering and distributing clothing, medical supplies and hygienic equipment for those in need.Chmerkovskiy recently announced his decision to partner with Cryptorealism artist Davood Roostaei in an effort to auction one of Roostaei's paintings inspired by the war in Eastern Europe to raise money for Ukrainian refugees.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_681_News_2>\"We found out that there was this gentleman, this artist who, because of what he has gone through himself in Iran and through revolution and being imprisoned for his artistic views and all of that, he is now reaching out and saying, 'Look, this is what I want to do to help out Ukraine because I understand,\" Chmerkovskiy explained. Chmerkovskiy explained to Fox News Digital he had no prior knowledge about Roostaei before partnering with him.Roostaei said his experience living in a war zone inspired him on numerous occasions to use his art to support certain charities, noting his specific goal for this piece. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_681_News_3>\"I like to use my work when I can to make a real impact — both through encouraging viewers to think and engage deeply with a particular topic, to consider alternative perspectives and to look beyond what’s readily perceptible,\" Roostaei explained. \"With this piece I hope to spread a message of peace and help others understand what the Ukrainian people are going through, and with the donation of the proceeds of the sale of this painting to Maksim’s charity, be able to send a more immediate assistance as well.\"The artist called Chmerkovskiy \"a kind-hearted, genuine person,\" saying it was \"an honor to work with him.\" He said Chmerkovskiy \"being from Ukraine\" allowed him to have a deeper \"understanding as to what the needs of the Ukrainian people are\" and the best methods to help them.Chmerkovskiy also discussed his IVF journey with his wife Peta Murgatroyd, revealing she has had a number of miscarriages, making this year even more traumatic for the couple. He noted their son Shai has been their \"anchor\" during these tough times.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_681_News_4>Switching gears, he discussed the upcoming season of \"Dancing with the Stars\" premiering on Disney+ later this month.\"I do have to pay respect to the place that made me and gave me the platform, so I'll always be a supporter,\" he said. \"I wish them, you know, an amazing season.

{"title": "Air Force colonel recalls the last flights out of Kabul in one of the largest evacuations in history", "body": "One year ago, Col. Colin McClaskey was on one of the last U.S. military flights out of Kabul. He was the Air Force Colonel responsible for the control, operation and maintenance of the airfield and runways during the messy Afghan withdrawal.McClaskey was a critical piece to what became the largest evacuation in history, as 778 flights evacuated 124,334 people over 17 days. On average, 7,500 civilians were evacuated daily with the high point being on Aug. 23, when more than 21,600 left aboard all types of aircraft departing every 34 minutes.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_0>McClaskey had been on a mission in Africa when he got the call to go to Afghanistan. Instead of going home, he would be sent to help end the 20-year war.\"I got a phone call that said, ‘This is going on in Afghanistan. We need you to go,’\" McClaskey explained to Fox News.Aug. 16 was the day the airfield was overrun with people desperate to get out. It was also the day McClaskey and his team tried to land.He was seated in the cockpit of a C-17 flying over Kabul watching the pilots try to land. \"Those folks tried everything they could to get into Kabul, short of landing on people,\" McClaskey said.The crew coordinated a tanker to try to get some extra loiter time, as the people below were clinging onto planes. Hours later, early on the morning of Aug. 17, McClaskey and his team touched down and got to work. He and his team had to rapidly repair radars, airfield lighting, refueling capabilities, ground servicing equipment and vehicles.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_1>McClaskey assessed the situation on the ground: \"These are families running away with whatever they have, whatever they can carry. And our troops. And when I saw our troops, not just Americans, but over 30 nations had folks there, too. So, trying to protect them and then finally to protect our aircraft.\"  Crowd control was a huge concern after the images he had seen on TV. Instead of shooting into the crowd, McClaskey decided to use C-wire, a type of barbed wire that unrolls very quickly. \"If someone wanted to jump over it, they probably could. But it's enough of a deterrent that it could help reduce some of that crowding,\" he said.C-RAM, a counter-artillery system, would also be used to shoot down incoming artillery rounds. A huge concern of McClaskey's was protecting all the desperate people from threats like the Taliban and ISIS-K.Then there were the operations of the airfield itself. \"I had a damaged air traffic control tower, but I didn't have the air traffic controllers that I needed or the communication systems that I needed,\" he related.The air-traffic controllers that were there ended up operating out of a tent called \"Kabul Tower Two,\" an ode to the damaged and unusable air traffic control tower.Junk had also piled up on the runway. \"Suitcases, mattresses, personal belongings, China sets, you name it, were just dropped on the ramp. Well, the more of those that piled up, the less aircraft could park there,\" McClaskey explained.Forklifts were used to move some of the equipment and other heavy items. The 621 Contingency Response Wing Airmen serviced, unloaded, repaired and loaded 721 of the 778 aircraft that transited Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA), servicing an average of four aircraft simultaneously 24/7.McClaskey is proud of the work they did: \"Our organization prides itself on having the ability to work two aircraft at the same time. And there were times we got up to 17 aircraft at the same time.\"McClaskey highlighted the bravery of U.S. servicemembers and what Americans being there meant to the people trying to escape. \"Imagine people come across a barrier with their families and everything they have, and they're doing whatever they can to get to safety. In this case, safety had a big American flag on the back of it,\" he said.Roughly half of the U.S. Air Force fleet of 222 C-17s were used during this operation. Three children were born onboard evacuation flights, with a dozen others born shortly after landing. Operation Stork was born.McClaskey used his skills as a father to help with the logistics of taking care of babies.\"Whether it was figuring out the formula problem set… How do we make sure that we have safe, clean water to mix with powdered formula, so it has the longest shelf life? And then working with some of our young folks who haven't had children to help them understand the importance of making sure there's clean diapers and lots of baby wipes and things like that. It was powerful,\" he said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_2>But it was not only infants and women. There were plenty of elderly people struggling in the crowds, as well. \"There were so many elderly or very disabled people that couldn't walk or couldn't get out there. And we didn't have wheelchairs or whatever else, but we had thousands of caring people,\" McClaskey said.By far the hardest day for McClaskey and his team was when a suicide bomber blew up at Abbey Gate, killing 13 young American servicemembers. At one point, the airfield lost electricity and several thousand Afghans were sitting in the dark. A young girl approached McClaskey. He tried to reassure her.\"She was just bawling and bawling and bawling,\" said McClaskey, who gave her hope and made sure she got out with her family.\"'And I can tell you, you will be in California,' which is where she wanted to go and stay with her uncle. I said, 'You'll be back in California before I am,' and she was. She left within an hour after that.\"He also noticed how good the young girl's English was. It was better than her brothers. McClaskey believes some of these young girls that escaped the Taliban are going to make it big one day. \"I will be shocked if we don't see one or two of those young ladies make it big, whether that's in pop culture or media or something. But they were driven and they are now unbound. They will go have great lives,\" he said.McClaskey and his team were among the last American servicemembers to fly out of Kabul on Aug. 30.Later that night, the final five C-17s flew into HKIA under the cover of darkness and loaded specialized equipment and more than 800 remaining U.S. military personnel in a period of three hours before departing at 11:59 p.m. local time.\"We made a very determined push several days prior to make sure that any ammunition, anything of that nature, anything that could be used for a military purpose was either disabled or not there anymore,\" said McClaskey.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_3>Sitting in the back of the plane headed for Germany, the servicemen and servicewomen with him were exhausted from what they had just accomplished. But McClaskey couldn't sleep. All he wanted to do was call his wife, so she could let the other military families know that he and his team were OK. \"I couldn't wait to call her and let her know that not that I was out and safe, but that every single one of our American airmen were out,\" he said.McClaskey's team was headed to Ramstein, Germany, because he wanted them to have a three-day mental health check to decompress and unpack everything they had just seen with professional help.\"I've seen a lot of things from the disaster in Indonesia in my career, but I hadn't seen anything like this, and I knew if this was shocking to me, this was going to be very difficult for a lot of our young folks,\" he explained.McClaskey said he is thankful he did it, but the trauma of how the war ended and the suicide bombing at Abbey Gate still haunts him. He says it is important to talk about the mission they accomplished and what they experienced.\"People need to just talk about it, especially those of us that were involved in it,\" said McClaskey.Reflecting on those weeks, he said, \"I think every day about those young Americans who are still living with the scars from that and will the rest of their lives. And I just hope that they know that we didn't give up.\"Still, McClaskey is grateful for the mission he helped to accomplish: \"I look back on that and I was like, man, I was tired, but God, I was grateful that we got all of those Americans out of there safely and then so many other people.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/air-force-colonel-recalls-last-flights-kabul-largest-evacuations-history", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "U.S. Air Force loadmasters and pilots assigned to the 816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron load passengers aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III in support of the Afghanistan evacuation at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 24, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234876625_1280x.jpg"}, {"caption": "A general view of the city of Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 5, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/kabul.png"}, {"caption": "Men wait in a line to receive cash at a money distribution organized by the World Food Program in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Nov. 3, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/men-in-line-kabul.jpg"}, {"caption": "Hundreds of people, some holding documents, gather near an evacuation control checkpoint on the perimeter of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 26, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_719_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/08/Kabul-airport-gate-closed-thumb-2.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Last US soldiers out of Afghanistan: ‘It was mission success or we were going to die’", "body": "Some U.S. troops recounted to Fox News Digital what it was like on the ground at Kabul Airport during the final day of the military withdrawal, talking about the difficult circumstances as well as the inspirational attitude with which the service members carried out their daunting task. \"None of the pictures I've seen do those crowds justice. Those crowds of just humanity stretched for miles outside of all three of those gates once the gates were attacked,\" William Callen, a retired U.S. Marine gunner who helped with on-the-ground logistics in Afghanistan, recalled. \"We had no mutually supporting position if we lost the airfield. There was nowhere to fall back to. It was mission success or we were going to die.\"President Biden set a goal to withdraw all U.S. troops by Sept. 11, 2021, but he pushed for an earlier wrap-up as the Taliban swept through the countryside and toppled the sitting government. The incursion only added to the chaos around Kabul as even regular citizens sought to escape the country before the Taliban could take control. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_723_News_0>The situation led to the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 Afghan civilians when an Isis-K suicide bomber attacked the Hamid Karzai International Airport Aug. 26, 2021.\"A marine expeditionary unit are the only ones that are trained to reinforce embassies and actually do a noncombatant evacuation operation … but no one trained to this scale of what [the evacuation] turned into,\" Callen explained, adding that the troops ended up \"inventing tactics on the fly, minute by minute, hour by hour.\"If one tactic to get a gate open and start getting people in stopped working, we had to shut the gate down, come up with another tactic and hopefully that would work on the gate.\" Sgt. Nicholas Miller-Assous told Fox News’ Bill Hemmer the focus during the final month had been to \"evacuate as many people as we could,\" with troops and officers asking at every step, \"Can we take more? Can we just take two more?\" The U.S. continues to process Afghan refugees one year after the withdrawal concluded. President Biden promised not to leave until every American citizen had left the country, but reports soon revealed that at least 450 Americans had remained in the country. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_723_News_1>The lack of experience with such overwhelming conditions did not, in fact, daunt the troops. Sgt. and Marine Corps veteran Joe Laude of the 2nd Battalion 1st Marines, said there was \"always potential for hostile engagements,\" but stressed that \"these vulnerabilities never deterred us from doing our job.\"Throughout my experience over there, it was definitely [focused on] controlling certain individuals. I always had guys by my side that were able to help push them back.\" He called the situation a \"big task\" for which most of the soldiers \"had no experience.\" The most wearying part of the operation he could recall involved constantly turning back individuals who didn’t have the proper papers or credentials, saying it was \"essentially their death sentence.\" \"It was really tough to force someone who was scared for their lives back to the exit where the Taliban was waiting for them,\" he said. \"You know, people who didn't deserve it, and they just didn't have the credentials. They were very, very good people, very honest, living people … that was definitely a difficult thing to do for a lot of us.\" The troops still think about those final days in Kabul even a year later — so much so that Laude established Operation Allies Refuge Foundation to help vets work on issues related to mental health as well as help Afghan refugees move through the Special Immigration Visas (SIV) process. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_723_News_2>Callen recounted periods during his post at the Abbey Gate, the site of the now infamous bombing, when the troops had to work under live fire simply due to their proximity to the fleeing planes. \"We started getting shot at by a 50-caliber Russian machine gun … we couldn't see where we got shot at, nor [could we] maneuver because we were faced to the airport. It was fixed by security,\" Callen explained. \"And when you're doing things like security, you were always the hunted because you can't move.\"We get shot at for about three hours … we could not return fire,\" he continued. \"Really, they were shooting at the planes on the tarmac [that] were getting ready to take off, and they were just missing. And we would just have had been in service.\" Callen was eating dinner when he heard that Afghan citizens had swarmed one of the American planes — around 7,000 people by his estimate — and they had to clear people away from the planes. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_723_News_3>\"At that time, we had a little under 200 American Marines on the east side of the airport … a little under 200 Marines went out into the dark to a fistfight probably (5,000) to 7,000 Afghan civilians, and we had to push them off the entire airfield,\" he said. \"We tried to create a human tunnel and funnel them out of the airfield, but the Taliban had set a checkpoint to the south of the civilian terminal. So the civilians were given a decision: Taliban bullets or our fists, and they chose our fists. The civilians never left.\"U.S. Air Force Col. Colin McCloskey told Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin that the Air Force did \"everything they could\" to get into Kabul and pull people out \"short of landing on people.\" \"Imagine people come across a barrier with their families and everything they have, and they’re doing whatever they can to get to safety,\" McCloskey said. \"In this case, safety had a big American flag on the back of it.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/last-us-soldiers-afghanistan-mission-success-die", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_723_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Crowds of people wait outside the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, Aug. 25, 2021, in this photo obtained from social media.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_723_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/afghans_crowd_kabul_airport-e1633129975824.jpg"}, {"caption": "Sgt.

{"title": "Lt. Col. Scott Mann reflects on stranded Afghan commandos, Task Force Pineapple one year later", "body": "The retired green beret behind Task Force Pineapple, one of the most prevalent veteran-led groups that helped rescue Afghan allies as the Taliban seized Kabul, reflected on his efforts one year later and blasted the U.S. government for ignoring the more than 20,000 Afghan commandos still stranded in Afghanistan.Afghans rushed the Kabul airport in hopes to escape as the capital city fell to the Taliban in August 2021. Numerous groups, mostly composed of veterans, organically formed to help their old Afghan allies navigate past Taliban checkpoints and secure transport out of the country.\"They're the most hunted, at-risk individuals,\" retired Lt. Col. Scott Mann said of the commandos still stuck in Afghanistan. \"Yet there's no pathway for them to come to the United States.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_0>Since the withdrawal ended last year, the Task Force Pineapple team has shifted its efforts to keeping the remaining commandos alive while advocating for a pathway out of Afghanistan.\"It has been a year since Kabul collapsed,\" Mann told Fox News. \"Like one of my friends says, it's harder in some ways than the actual collapse because … you realize that not much has changed in a year and there's still so much suffering from these amazing people.\"It's just hard to watch,\" Mann added.More than 6,000 Americans and 120,000 Afghans were evacuated during the August 2021 airlift, according to the U.S. government. Another 9,000 Afghans were since evacuated, The Washington Post reported in May.Task Force Pineapple, meanwhile, was rescued between 700 and 1,000 Afghans, according to Mann. But its operation was cut short after an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a suicide bomb at the airport on Aug. 26, 2021, killing 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 Afghan civilians.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_1>Afterward, Mann and his group of volunteers focused instead on trying to keep the stranded commandos \"alive through the winter, working with other volunteer groups to try to facilitate safe houses, medical care, food drops.\"Of the many Afghans still stranded, the commandos are near the top of the Taliban's most wanted list, according to Mann. The group, trained by U.S. Special Forces, did nearly all the fighting from around 2014 on, he said.Some members of Mann's team remain committed to helping their old allies.\"For special operators, for Green Berets, this is something that we're going to continue to do until properly relieved,\" Mann told Fox News. \"We understand the value of partnership and friendship.\" \"Many of us are alive because of the contributions that these Afghan allies made for us,\" he added.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_2>Mann said some of the U.S. veterans of the Afghanistan Warhave been demoralized by America's failure to keep the Afghan warriors safe. \"This is where I feel like our government, our administration, the State Department, and, yes, our military generals, past and present, and admirals have dropped the ball,\" he told Fox News. \"They're not looking at the impact that this has had on veterans and how they feel about it.\"\"They're just turning the page like it never happened, and we're going to pay that cost in the lives and mental health of our veterans and the Gold Star families and the military families for years to come,\" he contnued.A State Department official didn't address Mann's comments. Instead, he pointed Fox News to comments spokesperson Ned Price made in August clarifying that 17,000 Afghans had applied for special immigrant visas and detailed the efforts the government made leading up to the evacuation.Department of Defense spokesman Army Maj. Rob Lodewick said the Pentagon continues to support the State Department's efforts to relocate Afghan army veterans by processing referrals from active duty U.S. service members, veterans and others affiliated with DoD.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_3>Mann said the civilians aiding the abandoned Afghan soldiers have limited capability. He said the U.S. government needs to step in.\"It seems to me that the Biden administration, the State Department and our military leadership, they're just pretending like it doesn't exist,\" Mann told Fox News. \"They had their heads in the sand while the private sector is trying to just handle the problem.\"\"It is a big, big mess,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/lt-col-scott-mann-reflects-stranded-afghan-commandos-task-force-pineapple-one-year-later", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Scott Mann, the retired green beret who led Task Force Pineapple, recounts the group's efforts one year later.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/LT.-COL.-SCOTT-MANN.png"}, {"caption": "A man walks with a child through a military base in New Mexico where Afghan refugees are being housed.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/09/Afghan-Evacuees-New-Mexico.jpg"}, {"caption": "Mann poses with an Afghan soldier.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/09/b361f301-IMG_2646.jpg"}, {"caption": "Afghan citizens board a U.S. military plane leaving Afghanistan.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_725_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/08/E9KvAA_WUAAWqad.jpg"}]}
{"title": "HEROES OF KABUL: Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz would sacrifice his life again if it meant saving his fellow Marines", "body": "Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz thought he would die trying to get control over the Kabul airport during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.After a few days, the military was able to secure some degree of order. Then Jared learned he would be moved from his initial post to the airstrip.\"'I'm exhausted. I've got to go,'\" Jared's father, Mark Schmitz, recalled his son saying in one of their final conversations. \"He was just hurting for sleep so bad.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_734_News_0>\"I told him I love him. He says, ‘I love you back,’\" Mark recollected. \"And that was the end of that phone call.\"Jared, 20, was one of the 13 U.S service members killed by a suicide bomber at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 26, 2021. At least 170 Afghan civilians also died from the blast.Even if Jared had known an attack was imminent, he still wouldn't have changed his position, Mark said.\"He would’ve stayed right where he was,\" he told Fox News. \"Because if it wasn't him, it would be someone else, and he would never allow that to happen to another brother or sister.\"\"If he was ever going to go out, he'd want to die a Marine,\" Mark added. \"He would do it all over again.\" Jared's interest in the armed forces when he was a child, but his ambition to join the Marines really became apparent in high school, his father and stepmother, Jaclyn Schmitz, said.At a young age, Jared was \"just really passionate just about being there for people,\" Jaclyn told Fox News. Jared's father said his son's protective natured guided him toward the military.\"Jared made sure that no matter who you were, you were going to get taken care of,\" Mark said. \"He would not allow for bullying to happen. He would always intervene.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_734_News_1>Jared took his role as an older brother seriously. He watched out for his siblings and always walked them home from school, even carrying his youngest sister's backpack for her.\"Addison at one point said she was helping him for his Marine training,\" Jaclyn said. And as a young teenager, Jared started training with local Marines every Saturday morning.\"I’d never seen him ever dedicate himself to something like he did that,\" Jaclyn told Fox News. \"We knew at that point this was truly his calling.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_734_News_2>But even once he became a Marine, Jared kept his goofy personality, Mark said. He would do funny dance moves and silly voices.\"Jared really was no different than he was at home,\" Mark said. \"He had the most infectious laugh.\" Still, \"when he had the uniform on there was a sense of pride that beamed from him, because he was finally where he wanted to be,\" Mark added. \"Being in his uniform, I think, was his safe place.\"The community's support has been a lifeline for Mark and Jaclyn since Jared's death, the couple said.

It recently acquired Missouri property with plans to build a retreat for veterans and their families.\"Jared makes me proud to be a father,\" Mark told Fox News. \"Hewas a true American in every sense of the word.\"\"I told my wife the other day, I'm not afraid to die,\" he said. \"I know that in my heart of hearts, I'll see him again.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/heroes-of-kabul-lance-cpl-jared-schmitz-sacrifice-life-again-meant-saving-fellow-marines", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_734_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Marine Lance Cpl.

Belarus assisted Russia in its invasion in February.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_741_News_0>Instead, Kostyuk opted for a simple tap of the rackets at midcourt after her loss.\"It was my choice — I don't feel like I don't know any single person who condemned the war publicly, and the actions of their government, so I don't feel like I can support this,\" she said after the match, which she lost in straight sets.\"I just don’t think it’s the right thing to do in the circumstances I’m in right now,\" she added. \"We had a great match, don’t get me wrong.

Adapting to the environment and finding ways to achieve complex objectives are part of the job description for Special Forces troops, something Blackburn believes the Army's elite group of soldiers carried out expertly in the early days of America's longest war.\"I didn't think this whole ‘Horse Soldier’ thing was that big of a deal… it's what we do. We adapt to the environment that we're in to close with the enemy and defeat them,\" Blackburn said. \"The speed and lethality that we had, working with our Air Force partners, is what made us so successful so quickly.\"Retired Master Sergeant Keith Gamble, who was also a member of the 5th Special Forces Group soldiers making the initial push into Afghanistan, painted a similar story of the invasion's success.\"It was really good… exactly what we train for as Special Forces soldiers,\" Gamble told Fox News Digital.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_2>The retired Green Beret recalled that he was in a classified class on the morning of September 11, 2001, which happened to be covering how to deal with terrorists on an aircraft. Three weeks later, he would be on the ground in Afghanistan, a mission he and his team were eager to carry out after the terrorist attacks.\"Those guys had no clue what just hit them,\" Gamble said of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. \"We basically dropped bombs every single day for a month.… We fought every day and every now and then there was only a little bit of resistance.\"Gamble said that his small team kept a low profile and kept opposing forces guessing about where they would strike next. They traveled in the back of vans, while journalists covering the war attempting to figure out where they were had little luck finding them.U.S. forces and their Afghan partners rapidly degraded al-Qaeda's ability to operate and toppled the Taliban government less than three months into the war effort, an accomplishment made even more stunning by the small footprint of American forces on the ground.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_3>Taliban leadership and fighters began to flee into the mountains, blend with the local population and seek refuge in neighboring Pakistan. They would eventually regroup and mount an insurgency that led to America's longest military conflict.The U.S. involvement in that conflict came to an abrupt end last year, with the scenes of the American withdrawal still leaving a bad taste in the mouths of the troops first into the country over two decades ago.\"I think if we would have stayed with a small footprint, we wouldn't have the problems we have now,\" Blackburn said. \"We would not have the issue with leaving American citizens behind, with what America's ideals are when it comes to its citizens. We showed the world that were willing to betray our citizens.\"The former Green Beret believes that a smaller footprint of American military could have stayed behind and helped secure the country, if not to bring about the generational change America had promised, then at the very least to help secure the exit of American citizens and Afghan allies who helped the U.S. war effort.Blackburn also expressed remorse for the loved ones of Americans who lost their lives in Afghanistan and wondered how they must have felt during the final days of the war.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_4>\"I can't imagine, as a parent, watching what that looked like last August in Afghanistan, when your son or daughter was killed there for a cause, then you watched that happen,\" Blackburn said. \"For me, there's no other description other than our government betrayed the ideals of what we as Americans and a military fights force are about.\"Gamble, who returned to Afghanistan in 2018 and then again as a contractor in 2020, said he saw the warning signs that the Afghan military would collapse without American support. He argued that the U.S. should have kept control of Bagram Air Base and slowly evacuated people from the country. However, he noted that closing the base and opting for a rapid drawdown led to almost certain disaster.\"For the last 20 years, we were working with tons of people over there and they're still there,\" Gamble said. \"They are basically hiding for their lives right now because once the Taliban get a hold of them… they're dead.\"I feel bad that we basically just left them,\" he continued. \"We said we were going to help them and then we just bounced.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/some-first-troops-afghanistan-celebrate-victories-lament-failures", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Perry Blackburn, founder of AFG Free and a former commander with 5th Special Forces Group, with Special forces teammates and Afghan allies during 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/blackburn12.jpg"}, {"caption": "Perry Blackburn, founder of AFG Free and a former commander with 5th Special Forces group during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/blackburn3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Soldiers with 5th Special Forces Group in Afghanistan in 2001.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/gamble2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Perry Blackburn, founder of AFG Free and a former commander with 5th Special Forces group, trains an Afghan fighter during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/blackburn2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Retired Master Sergeant Keith Gamble with 5th Special Forces group during 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_758_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/gamble1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Iraq is in political turmoil again. Why is Biden missing in action?", "body": "On the eve of a potential nuclear deal with neighboring Iran, Iraq is in chaos – yet again. But this time, in what many Iraq analysts consider one of the most serious challenges yet to Iraq’s sovereignty and preservation of the state, Washington seems to have been missing in action. As David Schenker, a former Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East under former President Trump wrote a week ago, senior State Department and National Security Council officials visited Iraq only twice in the nearly nine months between the national election last October and the most recent outbreak of violence this week. Plus, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has made only a few publicized calls to key Iraqi decision-makers to try to ensure that a pro-Western, anti-Iranian government emerges in Baghdad. Although Washington has had a seasoned ambassador in the Iraqi capital since June, it is unclear how much backing Alina Romanowski has had from Team Biden.The latest round of violence this week followed an announcement by the influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr that he was withdrawing from politics. At least 23 of his followers were killed and more than 100 wounded Monday when they attacked the presidential palace in the so-called Green Zone and clashed with rival Shiite groups as deadly fire and mortar rounds rocked Baghdad. A tense calm was restored and a curfew lifted Tuesday after Sadr ordered his supporters to withdraw and apologized to the Iraqi nation for the bloodshed. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_778_News_0>Sadr, whose militia battled American forces during the American occupation of Iraq after the 2003 invasion, also has an uneasy relationship with Iran. Once an Iranian ally, Sadr, 48, has repositioned himself as an Iraqi nationalist determined to curtail both U.S. and Iranian influence in Iraq's internal affairs and to end corruption. The most influential Shiite religious figure openly involved in politics, Sadr has threatened to quit politics several times before, but has always returned to the political fray.Several experts on Iraq have complained about the apparent lack of American efforts to secure the emergence of a stable, pro-western government in Baghdad. Iraq has been without a government since October, when candidates loyal to Sadr won the largest number of seats in the Iraqi parliament, beating rival Shia groups backed by Iran. To prevent Sadr and his Kurdish and Sunni political allies from selecting a prime minister and cabinet, the Iran-backed opposition used its control of Iraq’s corrupt judiciary to require, for the first time, that a two-thirds supermajority be required to form a government. Unable to reach that threshold, Sadr’s members of parliament resigned en masse in June. Their seats were given to parties aligned with Iran.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_778_News_1>The Biden administration, for its part, insists that it has been trying to help Iraqis end their political logjam, but quietly, behind the scenes. \"This is on the Iraqis, not the Americans,\" agreed David Petraeus, the retired U.S. Army general who headed the multinational forces in Iraq and went on to lead the CIA. Asked Monday about complaints by Schenker about the administration’s apparent indifference to the political deadlock and growing Iraqi violence, Vedant Patel, the State Department’s principal deputy spokesman, said that the administration has \"consistently reaffirmed the U.S. Government’s commitment to a strong, stable, and prosperous Iraq.\"But critics complain that Washington has not pushed hard enough to prevent Iran’s interference in Iraqi affairs. James Jeffrey, a former ambassador to Iraq who served under former President Trump as a special representative to Syria, said that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had given Iraqi politicians a clear choice – either side with Iran and risk America’s substantial military, economic and political support, or push back against Iranian encroachment. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_778_News_2>\"This administration has refused to do anything like that,\" said Jeffrey. \"Rather, it is following a policy similar to that in Lebanon, continuing support a system as it ever more falls into the hands of Iran.\"The apparently low-key U.S. reaction to Iran’s growing interference in Iraqi politics has mystified some Middle East experts, especially after President Biden’s vow during his trip to Saudi Arabia last month not to \"walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia, or Iran.\" The mystery, said Jeffrey, is why, after Biden put so much effort into a trip aimed at reassuring Israel and Arab allies of America’s determination to contest Iran in the region, \"we are doing so little in a place as important as Iraq.\" Jeffrey, for one, speculates that policy differences within the administration may explain the gap between the administration’s rhetoric and its actions. But Schenker sees other possible explanations. \"It might be a band-width issue,\" he said in an interview. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_778_News_3>The administration could be stretched thin by the war in Ukraine, China’s threat to Taiwan, and other competing foreign and domestic challenges. Or, he said, Biden may be reluctant to challenge Iran openly in Iraq since his priority is reviving the nuclear deal with Teheran that former President Trump unilaterally scrapped. But if, as reported, U.S. and Iranian negotiators are on the verge of resuscitating the nuclear deal, Schenker added, \"you would think that an Iran dealing with political setbacks would be more conciliatory in negotiations rather than an Iran feeling its oats.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//opinion/iraq-political-turmoil-president-biden-missing", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_778_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Iraqi security forces fire tear gas on followers of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr protesting inside the government palace grounds, in Baghdad, Iraq, Monday, Aug. 29, 2022.

{"title": "How significant is resistance to the Taliban in Afghanistan?", "body": "When the Taliban swept across Afghanistan and caused the collapse of its Western-supported government last year, it declared itself the legitimate government of the country and promised to finally bring peace and security to the Afghan people.However, a resistance movement is seeking to challenge Taliban rule, growing its opposition to the organization in the country's Panjshir Valley.\"There's something there … there's potential there,\" Bill Roggio, the managing editor of Long War Journal, told Fox News. \"They've done this in the past. You had the Northern Alliance previously, these are fervent anti-Taliban individuals.\"Roggio's comments come as Afghanistan's National Resistance Front (NRF), a group made up of local volunteers and former Afghan military and police forces, have sought to grow their movement over the last year. Members of the organization were forced to regroup and reorganize themselves after the Afghan government collapsed and U.S. military forces departed, eventually gaining a stronghold in the historically anti-Taliban Panjshir Valley.The remote region of Afghanistan was once home to the Northern Alliance, which waged a civil war against the Taliban after it took control of the country for the first time in 1996. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S., American and allied special operations forces linked up with Northern Alliance fighters to topple the Taliban government.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_850_News_0>The leader of the new movement, Ahmad Massoud, has deep connections to the old Northern Alliance. Massoud's father, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was a revered leader of the former organization before he was assassinated by al Qaeda operatives two days before the terror attacks in the U.S.Ali Maisam Nazary, the head of foreign relations for the NRF, told Fox News Digital that the younger Massoud has inspired the growing resistance, which he says continues to recruit new fighters who aim to one day retake Afghanistan.\"We started from two valleys,\" Nazary said. \"Today, we are present in 12 provinces inside Afghanistan.\"Nazary boasted that NRF forces have found success on the battlefield, claiming that during one battle NRF fighters captured 40 Taliban forces, while in other recent battles they killed 40 more.CHINA PRAISES TALIBAN FOR PROVIDING 'BETTER SECURITY' TO AFGHANISTAN, BLASTS US ON WITHDRAWAL ANNIVERSARY\"We have been highly successful,\" Nazary said. \"The Taliban haven't had any military victories ... they've shown their weaknesses and basically every single military option they've had they have exhausted.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_850_News_1>Nazary said the Taliban has brought many forces into the region, including some of their most elite fighters, however, it has had little to no success rooting out the NRF. The NRF has had increased luck recruiting new fighters as a result of its success, Nazary said, helping grow its forces into something that they hope can one day mount an offensive capable of taking territory.The narrative painted by Nazary stands in stark contrast to that of the Taliban, who have strongly denied that fighting has been happening in the region. Shortly after the last of the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, the Taliban fought with the remaining pockets of resistance in the Panjshir Valley, and it claims to now have full control of the security situation there.Roggio said part of the challenge with tracking how strong the resistance truly is stems from a lack of reliable information, noting that the Taliban has been successful in keeping the fighting away from major cities and containing it to the country's most remote areas. There is also a lack of reporting from independent press, who depend on the Taliban to gain access to the area and are often only able to see what the Taliban wants them to see.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_850_News_2>According to a Washington Post report in June, locals in the contested valleys have cast at least some doubt on the Taliban's narrative. Reports of heavy fighting and casualties have spread from village to village, while civilian casualties have also increased as a result of the fighting.Roggio said the truth likely rests somewhere between the competing narratives, arguing that the NRF represents a threat to the Taliban but the Taliban still maintains the upper hand in terms of areas it controls and equipment it possesses.\"They obviously are not merely a nuisance,\" Roggio said of the NRF.Roggio noted that the NRF campaign is mostly dependent on guerrilla tactics currently, and a growing movement could help them take control of contested areas with strong anti-Taliban sentiment. However, for the organization to be truly successful in its long-term objectives, it would need some sort of support, most likely from countries friendly to its cause.Nazary spends much of his time lobbying for international support, basing himself out of Washington D.C., and Tajikistan in an attempt to sell the NRF as a legitimate challenger to Taliban rule, he told Fox News Digital. He paints the fight as a continuation of the U.S. and allied war on terror, pointing out that NRF forces have also engaged in fighting against terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_850_News_3>\"We don't characterize the current resistance as a civil war,\" Nazary said. \"This is the continuation of the global war on terror. However, our allies abandoned the struggle more than a year ago, and we're all alone fighting international terrorists.\"However, finding support from the international community for a renewed fight against terrorism in Afghanistan has proved difficult, with Western governments showing little interest in supporting an armed uprising against the Taliban.That reality was made more clear in July when the U.S. State Department said it does \"not support organized violent opposition\" to the Taliban. Instead, the U.S. is calling for the various factions in Afghanistan to settle their differences diplomatically.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_850_News_4>The State Department's position only served to enhance the NRF's feeling of abandonment after the U.S. ended its time in Afghanistan, Nazary said. He pointed out that a little more than one year ago the U.S. government supported the Afghan military in its fight to resist a Taliban takeover of the country.\"They were funding these forces, they were supporting these forces,\" Nazary said. \"All of a sudden, the policy has changed 180 degrees. How was it legitimate when NATO had a presence in Afghanistan, but it's illegitimate today?\"\"As far as I can tell that's official U.S. policy, which I think is insane, but here we are,\" Roggio said of the State Department's position.However, Roggio believes the NRF could represent a legitimate threat to Taliban rule, especially if the organization eventually does find a sympathetic ear from the international community. He noted, however, that the group has a long road ahead and will face significant difficulty in achieving its objectives.\"It's hard to judge how successful they'll be,\" he said. \"They look to be viable.\"Nazary struck an optimistic tone, noting that the resistance to Taliban rule is only in the first phase. He argued that the NRF will continue to grow its capability, saying the leadership will be deliberate with their planning ahead of moving into an offensive phase.\"Right now, it's easy for us to take over districts … especially in the north,\" Nazary said. \"But taking a district is much different from sustaining control over it.

{"title": "In the room with the Taliban: words from one of the only female reporters left in Afghanistan", "body": "Life under Taliban rule has had a crippling effect in Afghanistan as women have seen their rights to education and employment stripped from them – in some instances by force. The suppression of basic human rights has largely been enforced through intimidation and overt threats, however one 32-year-old female journalist told Fox News Digital these efforts have not staunched her determination to continue working under Taliban rule.\"I tell them, ‘Don’t consider me as a woman, consider me as a journalist’,\" Meena Habib told Fox News Digital from her Kabul home with the help of a translator. \"I’m still active on a daily basis performing my duty. Despite all these restrictions I continue to be loyal to my people and my profession.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_0>Habib has become one of Afghanistan’s last female reporters, and she has continued to push for access to Taliban-led press conferences since the insurgent group took over one year ago.In pictures shared with Fox News Digital, Habib is seen sitting on a carpeted floor donning a traditional hijab to cover her hair and large sunglasses so that just her nose peeks out from her dark garb as she takes notes. She appears to be the only woman in the crowded room.The image is not a rare occurrence Habib said, explaining that she often finds herself \"the only female journalist sitting around [with] the militants in the Taliban.\"\"They tell me you have nothing to do with journalism as a woman,\" she said, describing her attempts to gain access to Taliban-led meetings and press events.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_1>The journalism industry throughout Afghanistan saw a sharp decline in activity over the last year with 60% of the media work force having ceased their activity – but women were impacted the most, according to findings by Reporters Without Borders. Over 76% of female journalists lost their jobs since Kabul fell to the Taliban. Those who have remained are subject to Taliban’s \"11 rules of journalism,\" which discourages any reporting that \"could have a negative impact on the public’s attitude.\"Habib, who explained that most women have stopped reporting from the field, described for Fox News Digital numerous threatening encounters she has faced amid her attempts to cover life in Afghanistan, including earlier this month. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_2>\"A Taliban [man] came towards me with a machete and wanted to hit my camera,\" she said describing the moment Taliban officials took coordinated action to disperse dozens of women who took to the streets of Kabul this month to demand the return of their basic human rights.\"The Taliban [were] preventing journalists from taking pictures,\" she added. Habib was able to flee the scene but fell during the chaos and hurt her leg, though her camera this time was spared she said.The scene earlier this month echoed similar events that took place on September 8, 2021, just one day after the Taliban announced its \"caretaker government\" and hundreds of Afghan women hit the streets for a women’s rights rally.The events that unfolded one week following the official U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan laid out the \"tense\" future Habib and others would face under the Taliban.\"[The] Taliban arrested me and broke my camera,\" she said.  \"They beat me.\"Habib did not allow the day’s events or any of the subsequent threats against her life stop her from continuing her work. \"This is a mission for me,\" she said. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_3>Habib’s persistence has paid off in some instances, and she has gained access to some government events and press conferences – though not always without reprisal. \"Some of the Taliban members had a good relationship with us,\" she explained, referring to previous relations she and others shared with Taliban media officials. Former spokesman of the Ministry of Interior, Saeed Khosti, was fired after a December 2021 journalism conference where he posed for a picture with Habib and two other women. The other female reporters were also fired from their positions, and Habib was forced to hide out after she received threatening calls from someone she suspected was in the Taliban. \"They bother female journalists – harassment,\" she explained. \"To terrify them.\"Habib told Fox News Digital she could have fled Afghanistan during the U.S.’s withdrawal, but she decided to stay, saying she will not stop her work until restrictions on women and the media are lifted.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_4>\"This is a man ruling country,\" she said. \"Of course, there are threats of arrest or further trouble. I chose this profession – it's not a country that is friendly to journalists. But despite all these threats I remain committed to my profession, and I continue working.\"Fox News Digital asked if Habib would like her identity concealed for her protection, but she refused and said, \"I stand by my comments.\"\"Woman mostly suffer,\" she added. \"But they need access to information and as a female journalist I’m trying to provide whatever information is possible.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/room-taliban-words-one-female-reporters-left-afghanistan", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Afghan journalist Meena Habib works following Taliban takeover.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/51cddd89-da4d-40f7-adc1-771adc66b79d.jpg"}, {"caption": "Meena Habib sits in Taliban led press conference.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/ff158d0f-7675-4cf0-8169-ff68aea465a8-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "Meena Habib is one of the few remaining female journalists continuing her work following Taliban takeover.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/62349e5a-678e-49b5-8004-1e28f5be348b.jpg"}, {"caption": "Meena Habib sits surrounded by Taliban members", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/325d6eb9-449f-41eb-a4ea-471df4cd5d69.jpg"}, {"caption": "Meena Habib and others pose for picture in December 2021 with the former spokesman of the Ministry of Interior before he was terminated.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_886_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Meena-with-former-spokesman-of-Interior-Minsistry.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Fallen soldier and devoted father lost in Afghanistan left legacy of true friendship", "body": "What makes a good friend? One man truly knew the secrets of being a good friend to others.Army Capt. John L. Hallett III, 30, died 13 years ago this Thursday, on Aug. 25, 2009, in southern Afghanistan along with three other soldiers when an improvised roadside bomb exploded. Hallett was a West Point graduate. He left behind his wife, Lisa, and their three children (the youngest child, a daughter, was born after Hallett died, so he never got to see or hold her).\"He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 5th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, Wash,\" according to West Point's website.The soldiers were returning from a medical mission after they had delivered medication to stop an outbreak of cholera, a bacterial infection, according to multiple reports. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News_0>At Hallett's funeral 13 years ago, the church was overflowing because of the number of people who wanted to pay their respects.His friends were organized into categories because so many wanted to reminisce about stories about him — paying homage to Hallett’s penchant for lists. \"In any friendship, I believe laughter is a trait that is needed for the relationship to blossom,\" said Patrick DeGroot, 43, one of Hallett's childhood friends. \"John was able to be good friends with so many people because he had this characteristic,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"As Mark Twain wrote, ‘Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand,’\" he said. \"With John, what was maybe a brief disagreement was no match for a good laugh.\"John Hallett was born on July 6, 1978, at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Southern California. His family moved to Pleasant Hill in Northern California when he was 5. \"We made the move at Thanksgiving, so he made a few friends in Pleasant Hill,\" his mother, Wendy Swanson Hallett, told Fox News Digital. They soon moved to Concord, California, a nearby residential suburb, but young John struggled initially with the move. \"He had a hard time without any friends,\" added his mom.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News_1>\"The community we moved to was a difficult one to accept new people. In retrospect, I think that is a factor than made him so welcoming and accepting of people,\" his mother noted.  \"He knew what it was like to not be welcomed into a little group of friends,\" she said.Hallett attended St. Agnes Elementary School in Concord, California, from first to eighth grade. He was known as a happy-go-lucky kid with a sprinkle of freckles and not-so-subtle red hair. As he started making friends, he picked up gigs on the weekends, doing magic shows for anyone willing to watch.\"He loved magic and literally at times could pull a ‘rabbit out of his hat’ when situations would get tough,\" friend David Adler told Fox News Digital. Adler went to both elementary school and high school with Hallett and was one of his closest friends.Hallett became a paperboy for the local newspaper and inspired another classmate to follow, all for the privilege of waking up in the early morning hours to deliver newspapers in a bag strapped over their shoulders that felt at times heavier than they were as kids.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News_2>Hallett competed in basketball during the school year, dreamed about home runs while playing baseball during the hot summers and participated in Cub Scouts, including camping events, as a kid. But one sport defined him: swimming. He couldn’t wait for school to end every year to start swimming on the local swim team or spend quality time with his family in the summer lake, perfecting his cannonballs as he proudly modeled his fresh summer buzz cut.When he entered De La Salle High School in Concord, California, he immediately signed up to play water polo with a set of boys who were equally naïve about the game but just as determined to become great. \"We called him ‘Madgame’ because he was ferocious in all sports he played, especially in [the] water when he swam and played water polo,\" Adler said.As his circle of friends grew, so did his height. By senior year, he was over 6 feet tall, but eventually his two younger brothers outgrew him. \"But he could always beat them,\" his mother said. After high school, he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. There, he earned a spot to play water polo for the school during his first year.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News_3>He confided to his parents that playing water polo allowed him more privileges than many of his other college classmates, so it made it more bearable.But it was still stressful. His parents encouraged him to call his friends over from the very brief time that West Point allowed him off campus to celebrate his successful milestones there — sometimes by simply watching boxing matches on television.After graduating three months before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he reported to Fort Benning, Georgia, for infantry officer basic training, according to the Los Angeles Times.  Because he had excelled at West Point, he earned one of his top choices for duty station. Hallett reported for duty in spring 2002 at Schofield Barracks in Honolulu, the paper added.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News_4>He proposed to his future wife, Lisa, on Valentine’s Day in 2003 at the top of Diamond Head, a volcanic cone on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, per the Los Angeles Times.She spoke to Fox Digital News about how she developed a nonprofit, Run to Remember, in memory of her husband; it has grown nationally since. She herself just ran 100 miles this past weekend to help raise money to support \"those preparing for a deployment, living through a deployment, recovering from a deployment and healing from loss sustained during a deployment,\" as her website notes.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News_5>She created it as \"reminder that freedom isn’t free — it was bought and paid for by men and women in uniform.\"John Hallett deployed for a 13-month tour of duty in Iraq in January 2004, just three weeks after his wedding.After returning to Hawaii in early 2005, he moved in March 2006 to Fort Polk, Louisiana, to serve as a platoon senior observer-controller. He reported to Fort Lewis in late 2007, where he served as a battalion personnel officer, assistant operations officer and company commander. He later took command of a Stryker infantry company in November 2008, according to George W. Bush Presidential Center’s website. In July 2009, he deployed with his brigade to southern Afghanistan while his third child, Heidi, was born back in the U.S. several weeks later, the website also noted.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News_6>He was killed in combat shortly after — without ever meeting his new daughter.His wife, Lisa, told Fox News Digital this week, \"He had a quiet way of doing the right thing — not in a way that was showboating, and not in a way that was condescending toward anyone else.\" She added, \"I think in this world today of Instagram and social media, we often have this vision of the picture-perfect life. With John, the beauty of the way he lived was with earnest honesty — and just with his presence and the simplicity of everyday life.\"And \"when you were around that,\" she said, \"it made you feel that you wanted to be a part of that.\"\"Outside of the water, Hallett was one of the nicest guys you would ever meet,\" Adler told Fox News Digital.\"He loved being around people and had a very goofy sense of humor. John was always willing to help all of his friends,\" he added. \"He was a devoted husband and wonderful father. He is truly missed, but his legacy lives on with his three beautiful children.\"Said Shasta Nelson, friendship expert and author of \"Frientimacy: How to Deepen Friendships for Lifelong Health and Happiness,\" \"The loss of a friendship is devastating, as it not only takes someone away who we liked but we are losing someone who knew us, who supported us and who built a meaningful shared history with us.\"She also told Fox News Digital that \"a friendship is formed any time two people both spend consistent time together in a way that leaves them both feeling seen and liked.\"\"The more [people] practice the three most important factors in a friendship — consistent time, vulnerability and positive emotions — the closer we’ll feel to each other,\" she added. There is no psychological test for friendships, said Dr. Elie G. Aoun, an addiction and forensic psychiatrist at Columbia University and a member of the American Psychiatric Association board of trustees.\"But it is important to surround yourself with people who understand and accept your emotional triggers,\" he told Fox News Digital.\"Your best friend should know when to push you to take personal, social and emotional risks that will allow you to expand your social and emotional repertoire/status quo.\"As Lisa Hallett told Fox News Digital about her husband, \"He showed up as a friend because he was real, and he was good, and he was kind.\"Steven Randall, another one of John's good friends, told Fox News Digital, \"John would do anything for his friends. He treated folks like he wanted to be treated — with dignity and compassion.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/fallen-soldier-devoted-father-lost-afghanistan-legacy-true-friendship", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_966_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Army Capt.

{"title": "‘They’re family now’: California family takes in Crimean couple who risked their lives to get to US", "body": "It wasn’t an easy journey by any means: Crimean nationals Yana and Ilias fled their homeland after fatal threats from the Russian government. Ilias, who owns a cafe in Crimea, decided to take on the perilous flight in search of safety with his wife in June, almost four months after Russia invaded Ukraine. While Crimea is technically Russian territory, most Crimeans do not self-identify as Russian. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Crimea, the United Nations estimated more than 5,000 Ukrainian civilians died, with no exact count on Ukrainian soldiers. More than 5 million, the UN estimates, fled their homes since February.To many, those massive numbers might seem like just that — numbers. Ilias and Yana, identified only by their first names for their safety, are two of those numbers. For them, fleeing the region was a life-or-death choice.With no survival plan, the two made their way to Mexico. \"We left Crimea urgently. Our lives were threatened and at that point, all we wanted to do was stay alive,\" Ilias told Fox News Digital through translator and consultant Rebekah Koffler. \"We didn’t have much money. We didn’t have much time to get our belongings together. When we got to Mexico, we began feeling more safe and secure.\"But they weren’t safe for long.The couple took a 40-hour bus ride to Tijuana to get closer to the U.S. border and ended up sleeping on the street and being robbed their first night. Not wanting to alarm family back in Crimea, they called some friends, who sent them some money that bought them food — finally — on the second day.They stayed at a hotel for $30 a night, a steep price after being robbed, as they tried daily to get across the border. Now desperate, it was time to make a record trek to the U.S. embassy.\"We received a list of philanthropic agencies and charities that could help us. We made a record walk that day: [12 miles], because it was [6 miles] to the embassy and [6 miles] back to the charity agency,\" Ilias said. \"From that agency, they directed us to another agency within [half-a-mile], and we were hoping to get help there.\"Eventually, CESFOM (the Centro Scalabrini de Formación para Migrantes) along with a good Samaritan identified as Geniya — she herself from Ukraine and residing in Mexico — helped them with shelter and food.While Ilias and Yana were grateful for the help, they still needed a more permanent solution. Geniya, the good Samaritan, got in touch with Rusty Yunusoff to be their U.S. guarantor. Yunusoff encourages Americans to check out ukraine.welcome.us if they’re interested in sponsoring Ukrainian migrants, as well as Uniting for Ukraine at dhs.gov/ukraine. He likened it to match-making for volunteer families.\"This is a vast and enormous empire that colonized most of the Eurasian region that took over the Siberian population that is predominantly Asian, Buddhist and their own culture — but Russia just takes their resources, giving them nothing in return,\" Yunusoff told Fox News Digital. \"Their very aggressive colonial policies — the Northern Caucasus and many of the nations of Finno-Ugric origin are just vanishing because there’s no support for the languages or culture. Russia is an aggressive, imperialistic force that needs to be stopped, and America’s done a great job.\"After seeing a social media post from Yunusoff, Californians Karena and Nick Salch made the life-changing decision to welcome the young couple into their Corona home.\"We’re people who always help people, basically, but this is the first time we’ve ever had the opportunity to take somebody into our home,\" Karena told Fox News Digital. \"It was kind of a no-brainer.\"Ilias and Yana were at the Salch home by 9:30 that night, exhausted from their travels. They told Karena they were going for a walk.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_0>\"We don’t live in a very walkable city, but they were gone for about two hours and 11:30 at night rolls around,\" Karena said, adding that she and her family were getting worried.\"When they got back to the house at 11:40 at night — they’d walked with what little money that they had and went down to Walmart and bought us a cake,\" she continued. \"I didn’t even know how to accept that — that kind of generosity after what they’d been through. To me that just shows who they are, and we’re happy to have them.\"\"It’s been two weeks, but they’re family now.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_1>The Salch family set up a GoFundMe titled \"Help Ilias and Yana!\" for the young couple to help them settle and even assist relatives to come stateside, easily searchable on the GoFundMe website.The young couple has gotten to know the family well: barbecues with extended family, neighbors reaching out with gifts, beach days and even a surprise birthday for Ilias. Karena posted a TikTok video of Ilias making sushi on Aug. 11 that since had more than 3.2 million views. It’s captioned: \"We took in a Ukrainian refugee couple 2 weeks ago. Ilias owned a restaurant and is a chef. Now we get sushi and other amazing meals every night. They think they’re the lucky ones. But we are the lucky ones.\"\"To every American out there, it is mutually beneficial not because you’re going to have a Ukrainian in your home cooking sushi, but for us, I think it gave both of us a renewed purpose for our lives… We can’t just go back to doing nothing,\" she told Fox. \"For anyone taking people into their home, treat them like family.\"Her husband Nick and son Tyler shared that sentiment. \"From the second they showed up, you see how kind they are, and they went and bought us the cake on the first night,\" Nick said. \"And it was just like, everything’s going to be OK.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_2>And Tyler: \"For me, I’ve been an only child my whole life and it gets really lonely being by myself all the time. It’s been such a huge change in my life with Ilias and Yana now… It’s really awesome to have people around to do stuff with.\"Fox also spoke with Inna Levien of Uniting for Ukraine, the group that assisted Yana and Ilias’s path to safety. She emphasized how much help Americans can give through their hospitality, and wanted to deliver a crucial message about the Ukrainian people in general.Her message: These folks are hard workers. They might have been put in a horrific situation, but they are not victims. \"Ukrainians are hard-working people and they would hate to ask or beg for help, because they normally help others, and here they are where they’re in a situation where there’s a lot of risks to their lives where they still would not even ask until they’re desperate,\" she said. \"So we still find people who are stranded.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_3>The new Salch family members have a message for Americans. \"Americans are so responsive, kind-hearted and just overall good people,\" Yana said.And Ilias: \"All we wanted when we were in Crimea was to stay alive. We had no idea that we’d be able to be in such wonderful conditions right now: not only to be alive, but to be in such a good situation.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/family-now-california-family-takes-crimean-couple-risked-lives-get-us", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Crimean couple Ilias and Yana at the beach after fleeing from Crimea to California.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Ilias-beach.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ilias has a surprise birthday party with Yana and the Salch family.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Ilias-surprise-birthday-party.jpg"}, {"caption": "Crimean couple Ilias and Yana hang out at the lake with their new family.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Ilias-Yana-lake.jpg"}, {"caption": "Crimean couple Ilias and Yana spend time at the beach with the Salch family.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_979_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Salchs-Ilias-Yana-beach.jpg"}]}

And with a strict interpretation of Islamic law guiding the society, countries are reluctant to do business with the Taliban.Right now in Afghanistan, young girls are banned from attending secondary school in most provinces, all women must be home at night unless they have a male escort and press freedom has plummeted.The Taliban tells Fox News that security has gotten better under their rule. Some civilians we spoke with agreed, but it begs the question: \"At what price?\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_3>You see the desperation in the streets of Kabul. Young groups of children beg for change. Sick civilians lie outside the gates of a hospital. People are skipping meals. Many of these problems existed before the Taliban came into power, but they’ve gotten worse under the group’s rule, according to international observers.Inside a malnutrition ward, we meet a mother named Fatima. Her 11-month-old son is slowly slipping away due to malnutrition. If he dies, it will be the fourth child she’s lost. You see the pain in her eyes, you hear the loss of hope in her voice. Fatima, like so many Afghans, is desperate for international aid.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_4>The situation is far worse in the more rural areas of Afghanistan. Another mother we met traveled to Kabul from the province of Kunduz and is just 16 years old. The girl tells us her first child died when she was only 13. Any semblance of stability in Afghanistan is due to billions of dollars in international aid still making its way into the country. Countries and NGOs must find a way to continue humanitarian efforts without supporting the governing style of the Taliban as they roll back freedoms for the civilian population.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/reporters-notebook-taliban-rule-brings-famine-fear-oppression-afghanistan", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Trey Yingst and cameraman Michael Pohl standing with armed Taliban fighters in Kabul.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/afghan-6.jpg"}, {"caption": "Armed Taliban men gather in Kabul.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/afghan-11.jpg"}, {"caption": "Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst speaks to Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi in Kabul.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/afghan-5.jpg"}, {"caption": "An impoverished Afghan family in Kabul.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/afghan-111.jpg"}, {"caption": "Afghan children in Kabul.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1004_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/afghanistan-32.jpg"}]}
{"title": "North Korea dismisses Seoul's aid offer as 'foolish' repeat", "body": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said her country will never accept South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's \"foolish\" offer of economic benefits in exchange for denuclearization steps, accusing Seoul of recycling proposals Pyongyang already rejected.In a commentary published by state media Friday, Kim Yo Jong stressed that her country has no intentions to give away its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles program for economic cooperation, saying \"no one barters its destiny for corn cake.\"She questioned the sincerity of South Korea’s calls for improved bilateral relations while it continues its combined military exercises with the United States and fails to stop civilian activists from flying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets and other \"dirty waste\" across their border.She also ridiculed South Korea’s military capabilities, saying the South misread the launch site of the North’s latest missile tests on Wednesday, hours before Yoon used a news conference to urge Pyongyang to return to diplomacy.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1012_News_0>\"It would have been more favorable for his image to shut his mouth, rather than talking nonsense as he had nothing better to say,\" she said about Yoon.South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, expressed \"strong regret\" over Kim Yo Jong’s comments, and Yoon's office called for Pyongyang to show \"self-restraint\" and \"think deeply\" about Seoul's offer.\"This attitude from North Korea will not only threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula but result in further difficulties for the North by worsening its international isolation and economic situation,\" Lee Hyo-jung, a Unification Ministry spokesperson, said during a briefing.Kim Yo Jong last week had threatened \"deadly\" retaliation against the South over the COVID-19 outbreak in the North, which it dubiously claims was caused by leaflets and other objects dropped from balloons launched by southern activists.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1012_News_1>Yoon during a nationally televised speech on Monday proposed an \"audacious\" economic assistance package to North Korea if it takes steps to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles program. The offers of large-scale aid in food and health care and modernizing electricity generation systems and seaports and airports weren’t meaningfully different from previous South Korean proposals rejected by the North, which is speeding the development of an arsenal Kim Jong Un sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.Kim Yo Jong, one of the most powerful officials in her brother's government who oversees inter-Korean affairs, said Yoon displayed the \"height of absurdity\" with his offer, saying it was realistic as creating \"mulberry fields in the dark blue ocean.\"She said South Korea's words and actions would only incite \"surging hatred and wrath\" from North Koreans and insisted Pyongyang has no immediate plans to revive long-stalled diplomacy with Seoul. \"It is our earnest desire to live without awareness of each other,\" she said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1012_News_2>Inter-Korean ties have worsened amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the U.S. that derailed in 2019 because of disagreements over a relaxation of crippling U.S.-led sanctions on the North in exchange for disarmament steps.There are concerns that Kim Yo Jong’s threats last week over the leafletting portends a provocation, of which the possibilities may include a nuclear or missile test or even border skirmishes. The United States and South Korea kick off their biggest combined training in years next week to counter the North Korean threat. The North describes such drills as invasion rehearsals and has often responded to them with missile tests or other provocations.During Wednesday’s news conference, Yoon expressed hope for meaningful dialogue with the North over his aid-for-disarmament proposal. Maintaining a reserved tone, Yoon said his government has no plans to pursue its own nuclear deterrent and doesn’t desire political change in Pyongyang that’s brought by force.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1012_News_3>Yoon spoke hours after South Korea’s military detected North Korea firing two suspected cruise missiles toward the sea and identified the western coastal site of Onchon as the launch location. Kim Yo Jong in her column said the weapons were fired from a bridge in the city of Anju, north of Onchon and farther inland, and ridiculed South Korean and U.S. capacities to monitor North Korean missile activity. The South’s military has yet to release its analyzed flight details of those missiles.\"If the data and flight trajectory (of the missiles) are known, (the South) will be so bewildered and afraid,\" Kim Yo Jong said. \"It will be a thing worthy of seeing how they will explain about it before their people.\"The latest launches extended a record pace in North Korean missile testing in 2022, which has involved more than 30 ballistic launches, including the country’s first demonstrations of intercontinental ballistic missiles in nearly five years.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1012_News_4>North Korea’s heighted testing activity underscores its dual intent to advance its arsenal and force the United States to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power so it can negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength, experts say.Kim Jong Un could up the ante soon as there are indications that the North is preparing to conduct its first nuclear test since September 2017, when it claimed to have developed a thermonuclear weapon to fit on its ICBMs.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/north-korea-dismisses-seouls-aid-offer-foolish-repeat", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1012_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "FILE - This photo provided on Aug. 14, 2022, by the North Korean government, Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, delivers a speech during the national meeting against the coronavirus, in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022.

Sunday, August 14, marks day 172 of the invasion. As a bonus, the teens are also helping out the needy in Chicago by donating the cereal.The Kellogg's company donated the boxes — about 5,000 of them, approximately.And the teens, who are members of the Chicago Children United for Ukraine, according to Reuters, created a gigantic cereal mosaic on the floor of the Wintrust Financial Corporation's Grand Banking Hall in downtown Chicago.For the yellow in the flag, they used yellow Corn Pops boxes.For the blue in the flag, they used blue Rice Krispies boxes.In this way, they recreated a depiction of the Ukrainian flag.\"It’s a math problem, really, but we wanted to beat the Guinness Book of World Records,\" said Sherry Koppel, the project’s art consultant, according to Fox 32 in Chicago. \"The kids did it, and they did it fast.\"\"We wanted to raise awareness for Ukraine,\" said one student, Michael Kotcher, as Reuters noted. \"So, we decided to break a record with a good cause behind it.\"The good cause includes Ukraine — but also, the cereal boxes are being donated to a local food bank.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1141_News_0>Donors pledged approximately $15,000 to the fundraiser so far.\"It's just great because we're helping globally and locally,\" said Kotcher.The teens broke the Guinness World Record for the \"Largest Packaged Food Mosaic of a Flag.\"On their website, the teens explained ahead of breaking the record, \"We are raising funds to support the people of Ukraine through Razom, as well as fighting hunger here in Chicago by attempting to set a new world record for the largest cereal box mosaic.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1141_News_1>They also wrote, \"Kellogg’s has generously donated 5,000 boxes of cereal (Rice Krispies and Corn Pops) that we will use to create the Ukrainian flag and break the current Guinness World Record.\"\"Once the mosaic is completed, Kellogg’s will donate the cereal to the Greater Chicago Food Depository.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1141_News_2>The students built the mosaic over a three-day period (August 10-12) in Wintrust Financial Corporation's iconic Grand Banking Hall on S.

Since the invasion began in February, she’s rescued more than 300 animals.\"These animals were locked and left in cages as bombs fell all around. It’s very scary, but I can’t leave them there,\" Popova said while stroking a caged tiger.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_0>The tiger is sick, only half the weight of a healthy 3-yearold.As her story spreads, it’s most often the military that calls her. She drives to the country’s most dangerous cities in her veterinary ambulance. She’ll tranquilize a creature with a blow dart and lift it into a cage in her vehicle with the help of Ukrainian troops. \"I found all these animals in very different conditions,\" Popova said. \"Some were starving or worn out. There were some cases where we couldn't save them, and they died.\"The ever-changing front lines have forced Ukrainians to leave their homes with little notice. Last-minute evacuations often come at the cost of animals left behind in occupied territories. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_3>While playing with the tiger’s tail, Popova explained she’s never had an incident with any of the animals. \"They can sense I’m there to help,\" she says. Her ranch is now home to more than 60 horses, including endangered Przewalski's horses. The rare breed is one of the world’s last truly wild horses.It took Natalia four tranquilizer darts to subdue one of them, compared to the single dose she’ll use on a big cat. One of her fields has morphed into a sanctuary for retired circus bears.New enclosures are constantly built to house deer, goats, raccoons and various birds like peacocks or poultry. Popova laughs at the stark contrast of transporting a van of lions versus a trunk full of chickens.Among the guests enjoying their newfound freedom was a sturdy gray donkey. The military mule was used to transport weapons at the start of the war. Popova smiled while saying troops named him HIMARS after the coveted high-power rocket systems the U.S. has supplied the Ukrainian war effort. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_4><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_5><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_6><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_7><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1155_News_8>He’ll now spend his days on the Kyiv farm, eating apples in retirement.\"It gives me hope and inspiration seeing them get a second chance at life,\" Popova said.The war created a crisis of forgotten animals, but the problem was prevalent before the invasion. \"Even in peaceful times, we were saving them from these situations,\" Popova added. The animal rescue group UAnimals reached out to her four years ago for help, and she quickly began her mission of rescuing and rehoming.\"There were a lot of animals living in private places. Some people have bears, lions, tigers that are kept in small cages with concrete floors. They suffer their whole lives,\" Popova added. \"We nurse them back to health before sending them to wildlife sanctuaries in Europe or Africa.\"She says she's received no governmental assistance and has relied primarily on donations.In a matter of days, many of the animals will get transported to zoos and rehabilitation centers in safer European countries.

{"title": "Israel, militants trade fire as Gaza death toll climbs to 24", "body": "Israeli airstrikes flattened homes in Gaza on Saturday and Palestinian rocket barrages into southern Israel persisted for a second day, raising fears of another major escalation in the Mideast conflict. Gaza’s health ministry said 24 people had been killed so far in the coastal strip, including six children.The fighting began with Israel’s killing of a senior commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group in a wave of strikes Friday that Israel said were meant to prevent an imminent attack.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_0>So far, Hamas, the larger militant group that rules Gaza, appeared to stay on the sidelines of the conflict, keeping its intensity somewhat contained. Israel and Hamas fought a war barely a year ago, one of four major conflicts and several smaller battles over the last 15 years that exacted a staggering toll on the impoverished territory’s 2 million Palestinian residents.Whether Hamas continues to stay out of the fight likely depends in part on how much punishment Israel inflicts in Gaza as rocket fire steadily continues.The Israeli military said an errant rocket fired by Palestinian militants killed civilians late Saturday, including children, in the town of Jabaliya, in northern Gaza. The military said it investigated the incident and concluded \"without a doubt\" that it was caused by a misfire on the part of Islamic Jihad. There was no official Palestinian comment on the incident.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_3>A Palestinian medical worker, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the blast killed at least six people, including three children.Earlier on Saturday, Israeli warplanes struck four residential buildings in Gaza City, all locations apparently linked to Islamic Jihad. There were no reports of casualties. In each case, the Israeli military warned residents ahead of the strikes.Another strike Saturday hit a car, killing a 75-year-old woman and wounding six other people.In one of the strikes, after the warnings, fighter jets dropped two bombs on the house of an Islamic Jihad member. The blast flattened the two-story structure, leaving a large rubble-filled crater, and badly damaged surrounding homes.Women and children rushed out of the area.\"Warned us? They warned us with rockets and we fled without taking anything,\" said Huda Shamalakh, who lived next door. She said 15 people lived in the targeted home.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_4>Among the 24 Palestinians killed were six children and two women, as well as the senior Islamic Jihad commander. The Gaza Health Ministry said more than 200 people have been wounded. It does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. The Israeli military said Friday that early estimates were that around 15 fighters were killed.The lone power plant in Gaza ground to a halt at noon Saturday for lack of fuel as Israel has kept its crossing points into Gaza closed since Tuesday. With the new disruption, Gazans can get only 4 hours of electricity a day, increasing their reliance on private generators and deepening the territory’s chronic power crisis amid peak summer heat.Throughout the day, Gaza militants regularly launched rounds of rockets into Israel. The Israeli military said Saturday evening that nearly 450 rockets had been fired, 350 of which made it into Israel, but almost all were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system. Two people suffered minor shrapnel wounds.One rocket barrage was fired toward Tel Aviv, setting off sirens that sent residents to shelters, but the rockets were either intercepted or fell into the sea, the military said.Sunday could be a critical day in the flare-up, as Jews mark Tisha B’av, a somber day of fasting that commemorates the destruction of the biblical temples. Thousands are expected at Jerusalem’s Western Wall, and Israeli media reported that the Israeli leadership was expected to allow lawmakers to visit a key hilltop holy site in the city that is a flashpoint for violence between Israelis and Palestinians.On Friday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in a televised speech that \"Israel isn’t interested in a broader conflict in Gaza but will not shy away from one either.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_5><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_6><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_7>The violence poses an early test for Lapid, who assumed the role of caretaker prime minister ahead of elections in November, when he hopes to keep the position.Lapid, a centrist former TV host and author, has experience in diplomacy having served as foreign minister in the outgoing government, but has thin security credentials. A conflict with Gaza could burnish his standing and give him a boost as he faces off against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a security hawk who led the country during three of its four wars with Hamas.Hamas also faces a dilemma in deciding whether to join a new battle barely a year after the last war caused widespread devastation. There has been almost no reconstruction since then, and the isolated coastal territory is mired in poverty, with unemployment hovering around 50%. Israel and Egypt have maintained a tight blockade over the territory since the Hamas takeover in 2007.Egypt on Saturday intensified efforts to prevent escalation, communicating with Israel, the Palestinians and the United States to keep Hamas from joining the fighting, an Egyptian intelligence official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_8><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_9>The latest round of Israel-Gaza violence was rooted in the arrest earlier this week of a senior Islamic Jihad leader in the West Bank, part of a months long Israeli military operation in the territory. A teen Islamic Jihad member was also killed in a gunbattle.Israel then closed roads around Gaza and sent reinforcements to the border, warning of retaliation. On Friday, it killed Islamic Jihad’s commander for northern Gaza, Taiseer al-Jabari, in a strike on a Gaza City apartment building.An Israeli military spokesman said the strikes were in response to an \"imminent threat\" from two militant squads armed with anti-tank missiles.Israel has approved an order to call up 25,000 reserve soldiers if needed. Authorities closed schools and imposed limits on other activities in communities within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the border.Hamas seized power in Gaza from rival Palestinian forces in 2007, two years after Israel withdrew from the coastal strip. Its most recent war with Israel was in May 2021. Tensions soared again earlier this year following a wave of attacks inside Israel, near-daily military operations in the West Bank and tensions at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site.Iran-backed Islamic Jihad is smaller than Hamas but largely shares its ideology. Both groups oppose Israel’s existence and have carried out scores of deadly attacks over the years, including the firing of rockets into Israel.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/israel-militants-trade-fire-gaza-death-toll-climbs-24", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A picture taken on August 5, 2022, shows Palestinian rockets fired from Gaza City in retaliation to earlier Israeli air strikes.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242327050.jpg"}, {"caption": "Mourners carry the body of Palestinian Tamim Hijazi, who was killed earlier in an Israeli air strike, in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on August 6, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242335639.jpg"}, {"caption": "A Palestinian man mourns his relative killed during an Israeli airstrike, at a hospital in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, on Aug. 5, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1228_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242334564.jpg"}, {"caption": "Palestinians mourn over the body of Tayseer al-Jabari in a hospital morgue.

{"title": "Biden team can't punt on North Korea missile program as Obama did", "body": "Get ready for North Korea’s seventh nuclear test. Yes, the hermit dictator Kim Jong Un is back. On Thursday, he gave a speech marking the 69th anniversary of the \"victory\" over the U.S. in the Korean War. It was really an armistice, and North Korea got the short end of the stick, but whatever. Kim declared his \"nuclear war deterrence is also fully ready to mobilize.\" Translation: Kim can probably order the first nuclear test since 2017 any time he wants.   <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News_0>The State Department warned in April that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear weapons test. During President Trump’s denuclearization diplomacy in 2018, North Korea shut down some facilities at their Punggye-ri tunnel test site. Now, satellite photos – which North Korea obviously wants you to see – show a refurbished site ready for a test. Kim is already upset about South Korea’s new government and the summer slate of U.S. military exercises with South Korea’s military so there won’t be any shortages of fake reasons for the test.   President Biden has no talent as commander in chief.  However, Biden can’t afford to put North Korea on the back burner like Barack Obama did. Here’s why. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News_1>North Korea grew its nuclear arsenal during the Obama-Biden policy of \"strategic patience\" and tested its biggest 140 kiloton weapon in September 2017. The best guess is that North Korea could build about 40 nuclear weapons and may have 10-20 nuclear warheads for medium-range missiles.   Kim won’t stop with a nuclear test. He longs for a no-kidding long-range missile that can reach the continental United States.   Trump’s fiery diplomacy in the summer of 2017 caused Kim Jong Un to stop nuclear and long-range missile testing after November 2017. North Korea did no tests at all in 2018. Granted, after 2019, they fired off a lot of older shorter-range missiles, and you can read all about them at the terrific Missiles of North Korea site maintained by the CSIS Missile Defense Project. However, the crucial long-range tests needed to mate nuclear weapons to missiles that guide, survive atmospheric re-entry, and reach U.S. territory just didn’t happen, thank heavens. Stopping tests left North Korea far short of an intercontinental capability.   <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News_2>The problem now is that Kim is not intimidated by Biden and that quite likely, it suits China just fine to see Kim Jong Un rile up the U.S. Even worse, experts believe North Korea is aiming to develop a nuclear deterrence triad of missiles, aircraft and submarine-launched nuclear weapons.   What the heck? A nuclear triad is a horrible investment given that North Korea is poor and prone to famine. But it would seal off North Korea from outside threats. Don’t forget North Korea is a client state of China. China is on a massive nuclear modernization drive of its own under Xi Jinping. China has opened new plutonium warhead production facilities that will help China double its arsenal. (Remember that when you think of the supply chain.)   <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News_3>Four years ago, the U.S. was confident it could take out a few \"rogue\" North Korean missiles if necessary. A key vulnerability is that most are liquid-fueled, requiring time to prepare for launch. \"Remember, missile infrastructure is not just the missiles,\" then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Paul Selva hinted at a roundtable with journalists in Washington in early 2018. \"If you’re the poor sergeant that has to go out and launch the missile, and I blow up your barracks, you’re not available to go do your job.\"  The U.S. also has ground-based missile interceptors in California and Alaska designed to hit and knock out a small number of North Korea missiles before they reach the U.S. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News_4>If North Korea develops advanced solid-fueled weapons and a larger arsenal, the problems for the U.S. and Asian allies increase. A bigger North Korean arsenal might one day overwhelm West Coast defenses. Then the only answer would be more nuclear deterrence. Remember the U.S. kept tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea from 1958 to 1991. Six F-35 fighter jets, which are capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons, conducted 10 days of exercises in South Korea in July, perhaps as a reminder.  You can see why Trump tried his combo of threats, diplomacy and visions of successful real estate development to jumpstart nuclear talks. Waving riches in front of the young dictator to tempt him to rapprochement was worth a shot.   Unfortunately, Kim Jong Un and his backers in China appear all set for ratcheting up nuclear confrontation. For Team Biden, the clock is ticking.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//opinion/biden-team-cant-punt-north-korea-missile-program-obama-did", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Joe Biden", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/kim-jong-un-biden.jpg"}, {"caption": "President Barack Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye meet in the Oval Office of the White House, May 7, 2013.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1330_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/4f48c259578b2f0f310f6a70670077f2.jpg"}, {"caption": "President Joe Biden arrives at Osan Air Base on May 20, 2022, in Pyeongtaek, South Korea.

Around 4,787,154 Ukrainians crossed the border into Poland – roughly half of the 9.8 million refugees that scattered into neighboring countries after the invasion started. That prominent role has thrust Poland once more into the spotlight as a key figure in security discussions. NATO debated trying to send Ukraine fighter planes by first placing them in Poland for troops to retrieve, and President Biden, in June, announced plans for the establishment of a new permanent U.S. Army headquarters in Poland, which Przydacz said is \"very welcomed\" by his country. \"If you asked me what we could do more, of course, the more American troops on the Polish ground, in the Polish soil, the better, so we will work on this with Washington in order to encourage them to be even more present on the … the Polish soil,\" he said, highlighting the various investment opportunities for American businesses in a \"stable democracy\" like Poland.The relationship between Poland the U.S. remains strong, with Przydacz describing his country as \"one of the most pro-Atlantic and pro-American\" countries in Europe, praising good relations between leaders of both nations.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1365_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1365_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1365_News_2>\"Whoever is sitting on the Hill and in the Oval Office, we are as follows … trying to have the best possible relations with America,\" he said. \"It was Ronald Reagan who paid special attention to the politics of Poland and is very much respected in Poland, and now being an ally, being a partner with Washington, we pay a lot of attention to those relations.\"\"It was like this with President Trump,\" he added. \"There was a special, special personal relation between our two leaders, but we have managed also to establish very good relations with the current administration.\"However, Przydacz warned that the West is \"not doing enough\" to combat Russia on every front, pointing to Germany as one ally with \"higher\" expectations who should \"do much more\" to support Ukraine and push back against Germany. \"When it comes to the criticism towards Putin, it shouldn't be only Poland, U.S. or our British allies, but also we should expect it from our German partners to do a bit more and to be a bit more active,\" he said. \"Let's be ambitious and let's let's try to encourage our German partners to be a bit more active.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1365_News_3>Poland, like the U.K. and several other nations at the forum last week, highlighted China's outsized threat to global security. Western efforts to alienate Russia and economically deprive it appears to have provided China with the opportunity to turn Russia in a more trusted ally. Przydacz urged the West – specifically, America – to do more to help mitigate that threat. \"We do perceive China as a challenge, again, to this global security architecture,\" he said. \"But I believe there should be a bit of division of labor.\"\"We are already on the front line in the western and eastern flank … doing our best in order to deter Russia, but whenever our allies asked us to help, we were, as a good ally, always ready to do it: In Iraq, we were with Americans; we were with Americans in Afghanistan,\" he continued. \"Hopefully, there will be no need for any kind of that kind of operations, but we are standing by our allies in order to preserve the world we are living in.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/polish-minister-china-remains-strategic-challenge-west-counter-russia", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1365_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "People who have fled from Ukraine board a train heading for Warsaw at the station in Przemysl, Poland, Monday, March 7, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1365_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/AP22066552742263.jpg"}, {"caption": "U.S. Soldiers of the 330th Movement Control Battalion stand in formation at Zagan, Poland, April 1, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1365_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/US-Soldiers-Poland.jpg"}, {"caption": "Poland's President Andrzej Duda talks for the media during a news conference with North Macedonia's President Stevo Pendarovski at the presidential office in Skopje, North Macedonia, on Friday, Nov. 19, 2021.

{"title": "How Russia spread a secret web of agents across Ukraine", "body": "When the first armoured vehicles of Russia's invading army reached the heart of Chornobyl nuclear plant on the afternoon of Feb. 24, they encountered a Ukrainian unit charged with defending the notorious facility.In less than two hours, and without a fight, the 169 members of the Ukrainian National Guard laid down their weapons. Russia had taken Chornobyl, a repository for tonnes of nuclear material and a key staging post on the approach to Kyiv.The fall of Chornobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, stands out as an anomaly in the five-month old war: a successful blitzkrieg operation in a conflict marked elsewhere by a brutal and halting advance by Russian troops and grinding resistance by Ukraine.Now a Reuters investigation has found that Russia's success at Chornobyl was no accident, but part of a long-standing Kremlin operation to infiltrate the Ukrainian state with secret agents.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_0>Five people with knowledge of the Kremlin's preparations said war planners around President Vladimir Putin believed that, aided by these agents, Russia would require only a small military force and a few days to force 's administration to quit, flee or capitulate.Through interviews with dozens of officials in Russia and Ukraine and a review of Ukrainian court documents and statements to investigators, related to a probe into the conduct of people who worked at Chornobyl, Reuters has established that this infiltration reached far deeper than has been publicly acknowledged. The officials interviewed include people inside Russia who were briefed on Moscow's invasion planning and Ukrainian investigators tasked with tracking down spies.\"Apart from the external enemy, we unfortunately have an internal enemy, and this enemy is no less dangerous,\" the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said in an interview.At the time of the invasion, Danilov said, Russia had agents in the Ukrainian defence, security and law enforcement sectors. He declined to give names but said such traitors needed to be \"neutralised\" at all costs.Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation is conducting a probe into whether the National Guard acted unlawfully by surrendering its weapons to an enemy, a local official told Reuters. The State Bureau of Investigation didn't comment. The National Guard defended the actions of its unit at the plant, pointing to the risks of conflict at a nuclear site.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_1>Court documents and testimony, reported here for the first time, reveal the role played by Chornobyl's head of security, Valentin Viter, who is in detention and is being investigated for absenting himself from his post. An extract from the state register of pre-trial investigations, seen by Reuters, shows Viter is also suspected of treason, an allegation his lawyer says is unfounded. In a statement to investigators, Viter said that on the day of the invasion he spoke by phone with the National Guard unit commander. Viter advised the commander not to endanger his unit, telling him: \"Spare your people.\"One source with direct knowledge of the Kremlin's invasion plans told Reuters that  were deployed to Chornobyl last year to bribe officials and prepare the ground for a bloodless takeover. Reuters couldn't independently verify the details of this assertion. However, Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation has said it is investigating a former top intelligence official, Andriy Naumov, on suspicion of treason for passing Chornobyl security secrets to a foreign state. A lawyer for Naumov declined to comment.At a national level, sources with knowledge of the Kremlin's plans said Moscow was counting on activating sleeper agents inside the Ukrainian security apparatus. The sources confirmed Western intelligence reports that the Kremlin was lining up Oleg Tsaryov, a hotelier, to lead a puppet government in Kyiv. And a former Ukrainian prosecutor general disclosed to Reuters in June that Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, a friend of Putin, had an encrypted phone issued by Russia so he could communicate with the Kremlin.Tsaryov said the Reuters account of how Moscow's operation overall unfolded \"has very little to do with reality.\" He did not address his relationship with the Kremlin. A lawyer for Medvedchuk declined to comment. Medvedchuk is in a Ukrainian jail awaiting trial on treason charges that pre-date the Russian invasion.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_2>Though Russia captured Chornobyl, its plan to take power in Kyiv failed. In many cases, the sleeper agents Moscow had installed failed to do their job, according to multiple sources in Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine Security Council Secretary Danilov said the agents and their handlers believed Ukraine was weak, which was \"a total misconception.\"People the Kremlin counted on as its proxies in Ukraine overstated their influence in the years leading up to the invasion, said four of the sources with knowledge of the Kremlin's preparations. The Kremlin relied in its planning on \"clowns – they know a little bit, but they always say what the leadership wants to hear because otherwise they won't get paid,\" said one of the four, a person close to the Moscow-backed separatist leadership in eastern Ukraine.Putin now finds himself in a protracted, full-scale war, fighting for every inch of territory at huge cost.But the Russian intelligence infiltration did succeed in one way: It has sown mistrust inside Ukraine and laid bare the shortcomings of Ukraine's near 30,000-strong Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, which shares a complicated history with Russia, and is now tasked with hunting down traitors and collaborators.This internal Ukrainian turmoil burst into partial view on July 17. In a video address to the nation, President Zelenskyy suspended SBU head Ivan Bakanov, whom he has known for years, citing the large number of SBU staff suspected of treason. Ukrainian law enforcement sources told Reuters that some SBU staff recounted in conversation with them that they were unable to reach Bakanov for several days after Russia invaded, adding to a sense of chaos in Kyiv. Bakanov didn't respond to Reuters' requests for comment.Zelenskyy also said 651 cases of alleged treason and collaboration have been opened against individuals involved in law enforcement and in the prosecutor's office. More than 60 officials from the SBU and the prosecutor general's office are working against Ukraine in Russian-occupied zones, Zelenskyy added.Asked to comment on Reuters' findings, the Ukrainian presidential administration, the SBU and the prosecutor general's office did not respond. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"All these questions have no relation whatsoever to us, therefore there is nothing for us to comment on here.\" The Russian intelligence agency, the FSB, and the defence ministry did not respond to Reuters' questions.KGB TIESMoscow's spy apparatus has been intertwined with Chornobyl for decades. After the 1986 disaster, when a reactor blew up scattering radioactive clouds across Europe, the Soviet KGB stepped in. More than 1,000 KGB staff took part in the clean-up, according to a declassified internal memo to a Ukrainian government minister, dated 1991. Then-KGB boss Viktor Chebrikov ordered his officers to recruit agents among the plant's staff and instructed that a KGB officer should hold the post of deputy boss of the plant in charge of security, according to another memo - an internal KGB communication from 1986.Even after Ukraine became independent in 1991, Moscow's spy chiefs remained powerful there. The first head of Ukraine's domestic intelligence service was Nikolai Golushko, who started his career in Soviet Russia. Before his appointment he led the Ukraine arm of the Soviet KGB. Golushko kept most of the Soviet-era officers in their jobs, he wrote in a 2012 memoir.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_3>After four months as Ukraine's spy chief, Golushko moved back to Moscow to rejoin KGB headquarters, and in 1993 became head of Russia's newly created Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, precursor to today's FSB.In Moscow, Golushko received a visit from the deputy head of Ukraine's State Security Service, Golushko wrote in the memoir. He recalled how Oleg Pugach, the Ukrainian official, asked for Golushko's help finding fabric to make the uniforms for Ukraine's intelligence officers. Golushko also wrote that Kyiv, short of its own resources and expertise, signed deals under which the SBU agreed to share intelligence information with Moscow. In exchange, Moscow provided  with investigations. Reuters approached Golushko for comment. A colleague from an intelligence veterans' group told Reuters Golushko, now 85, was in ill health and could not answer questions. Reuters was unable to reach Pugach and couldn't independently confirm Golushko's account.Intelligence officers working at Chornobyl officially became part of Ukraine's security apparatus in 1991, but they continued to take orders from Moscow, said the person with direct knowledge of the invasion plan. \"In effect, these were FSB employees,\" said the person. The SBU did not respond to questions about Chornobyl or historical ties to Russian intelligence.The Chornobyl nuclear plant is a vast facility. A giant steel structure encases Reactor No. 4, ground zero of the 1986 disaster. The plant lies just 10 kilometres at the closest point from the border with Belarus, in a dense and highly irradiated forest. Russia's war planners considered control of Chornobyl to be strategically important because it sat on the shortest route for their advance on Kyiv, according to Western military analysts.The source with direct knowledge of the invasion plan said that in November 2021 Russia started sending undercover intelligence agents to Ukraine, tasked with establishing contacts with officials responsible for securing the Chornobyl power plant. The agents' goal was to ensure there would be no armed resistance once Russian troops rolled in. The source said Chornobyl also served as a drop-off point for documents from SBU headquarters. In return for payment, Ukrainian officials handed Russian spies information about Ukraine's military readiness.Reuters could not independently verify details of the source's account, and neither Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation nor the SBU responded to the news agency's questions. But a review of Ukrainian testimony and court documents and an interview with a local official show that Kyiv is conducting at least three investigations into the conduct of people who worked at Chornobyl. The investigations have identified at least two people suspected of providing information to Russian agents or otherwise helping them seize the plant, according to these documents.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_4>One of the men suspected by Ukrainian prosecutors and investigators of helping Russian forces is Valentin Viter, a 47-year-old colonel in the SBU. At the time of the Russian invasion, Viter was the deputy general-director of the plant responsible for its physical protection.In May last year, Viter oversaw a routine training exercise that was meant to simulate an attack by armed saboteurs. Armed members of the National Guard unit that protects Chornobyl took part, and rehearsed repelling the attackers by force. Viter said the exercise was a success, according to a video interview posted shortly afterwards on the plant's website. He also said he hoped Chornobyl's security team would \"not need to apply the knowledge and skills we acquired in a real-life situation.\"Viter was seconded from the SBU to work at Chornobyl as security chief in mid-2019, according to a statement he gave to investigators. In a further statement, he said that on Feb. 18 this year – six days before the Russian invasion – he went on sick leave with a respiratory problem.By then, Russia was bolstering its troops in Belarus in preparation for an invasion, U.S. officials said at the time. Satellite images shot by U.S. satellite imagery company Maxar on Feb. 15 showed a military pontoon bridge under construction across the Pripyat River in Belarus, north of the power plant. Ukraine's police, and the SBU, were on heightened alert in response to the Russian threat, and the national police chief said in a statement at the time that security was reinforced at the Chornobyl plant.On the morning of the Russian invasion, Feb. 24, Viter said, in a statement to investigators, that he was at his home in Kyiv. He telephoned the head of the Chornobyl National Guard unit, who was at his post. By then, people at the plant knew a column of Russian armoured vehicles was heading their way.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_5>Viter, according to his testimony to Ukrainian investigators, told the commander, in Russian: \"Spare your people.\" Viter had no official authority over the National Guard, and Reuters could not determine whether the commander was heeding Viter's words when the unit surrendered after discussions with the Russian invaders. A National Guard statement identified the unit commander as Yuriy Pindak.When the Russian soldiers finally retreated from Chornobyl after a 36-day occupation, they took Pindak and most of his unit away as captives. Ukraine says the guards are being held in Russia or Belarus. Russian officials did not comment on the unit's whereabouts.Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation is conducting a probe into whether the National Guard broke the law by laying down arms, said Yuriy Fomichev, mayor of the town of Slavutych where most of the Chornobyl workers live. Fomichev said he was not aware of anyone having been charged. The State Bureau of Investigation didn't respond to Reuters' questions about the matter.The National Guard declined to comment on the actions of individual commanders and members of the unit tasked with protecting Chornobyl. \"Fighting on the territory of nuclear facilities is prohibited by the Geneva Convention,\" it said, adding that this was \"one of the reasons\" why there was no heavy fighting at the site. It referred questions about any investigation to the Bureau.Article 56 of an additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions states that nuclear power plants and other dangerous installations should not be attacked.Viter was arrested in western Ukraine and is now in pre-trial detention there on suspicion of absenting himself from his post. An extract from the court's register, seen by Reuters, shows that law enforcement agents have initiated a second investigation into Viter for suspected treason by \"deliberately assisting the military units of the aggressor country, the Russian Federation, in carrying out subversive activities against Ukraine.\" They have yet to uncover evidence tying him to Russian special services.Viter has said in court statements that he fled Kyiv for the safety of his family two days after Chornobyl was seized but tried to stay in contact with colleagues at the plant.His lawyer, Oleksandr Kovalenko, said Viter had a legitimate reason for being off work and was unaware that he should stay at Chornobyl. The lawyer said any treason allegation was unfounded and Viter had not been served with a letter of suspicion, a step which usually precedes charges. According to the lawyer, Viter said \"Spare your people\" to remind the National Guard commander that many people depended on him. Viter did not discuss surrender, Kovalenko said. He added that investigators had not asked Viter about any exchange of documents at Chornobyl.CASH AND EMERALDSThe extent to which Russia infiltrated Chornobyl has focused Ukrainian authorities' attention on the SBU, the agency Viter worked for, sources said. In particular, military prosecutors on Viter's case are interested in his connection to a former Ukrainian official called Andriy Naumov, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation and a transcript of Viter's questioning seen by Reuters.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_6>Previously an official in the Ukrainian prosecutor's office, by 2018 Naumov had been appointed head of COTIZ, a state enterprise responsible for estate-management of the radioactive exclusion zone around Chornobyl. A major part of COTIZ's role was to promote \"extreme tourism\" in the exclusion zone, but the enterprise also had a role in keeping the site secure, according to its website.After his stint at Chornobyl, Naumov was made the head of the SBU's department of internal security, a division that investigates other officers suspected of criminal activity. Last year, the agency said it thwarted an assassination attempt on Naumov by other SBU officers. Naumov was later fired as department chief, according to Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda and a law enforcement source.Naumov vanished shortly before the invasion, a person in law enforcement said. He eventually turned up in Serbia in June. A Serbian police statement issued on June 8 said police and anti-corruption agents had arrested a Ukrainian citizen identified by the initials \"A.N.\" on the border with North Macedonia. He had been trying to cross into North Macedonia from Serbia. A search of the BMW in which he was a passenger uncovered $124,924 and 607,990 , plus two emeralds, the statement said. It said the individual and the unnamed driver of the BMW, who was also detained, were suspected of intending to launder the cash and emeralds, which police believe originated from criminal activities. Volodymyr Tolkach, Ukraine's ambassador to Serbia, publicly confirmed the arrested man was Naumov.The State Bureau of Investigation confirmed a local media report that it is conducting a pre-trial investigation into Naumov for state treason. It said it was looking into whether Naumov collected information on the security set-up at Chornobyl while working at the plant and later at the SBU and passed it to a foreign state. The statement did not say what grounds it had for suspecting he passed on secrets or if it had specific evidence linking him to Russia.On March 31, President Zelenskyy issued a decree stripping Naumov of his brigadier-general rank. The same day, the Ukrainian president announced in an emotional address that Naumov and another SBU general were \"traitors\" who violated their oath of allegiance to Ukraine. Zelenskyy did not make reference to Chornobyl.Naumov remains in detention in Serbia and could not be reached for comment. His lawyer in Serbia, Viktor Gostiljac, declined to comment. The SBU did not reply to questions about Naumov.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_7>DECAPITATIONFor Russia's war planners, seizing Chornobyl was just a stepping stone to the main objective: taking control of the Ukrainian national government in Kyiv. There, too, the Kremlin expected that undercover agents in positions of power would play a crucial part, according to four sources with knowledge of the plan.Yuriy Lutsenko, who served as Ukraine's prosecutor general from 2016 until 2019, revealed to Reuters that at the time he left the role \"hundreds\" of Defence Ministry employees were under surveillance, approved by his office, because they were suspected of ties to the Russian state. Lutsenko said he believed there were similar numbers of suspected spies in other ministries.Russia's war planners were also counting on other allies to help in the takeover, five sources said.One of the most visible loyalists was Viktor Medvedchuk, a leader of Ukraine's Opposition Platform – For Life party. Putin is god-father to one of Medvedchuk's children. Since 2014, Medvedchuk has been a vocal opponent of the popular protests that called for closer ties to the European Union.Medvedchuk was charged with state treason on May 11, 2021. Investigators from the SBU alleged at the time that Medvedchuk passed secret details about Ukrainian military units to Russian officials, and intended to recruit Ukrainian agents and covertly influence Ukrainian politics. The day before the invasion, he left his home in Kyiv and was planning on leaving the country, in violation of the terms of his bail, according to the SBU.Medvedchuk was detained on April 12, Zelenskyy announced that day. Zelenskyy immediately posted pictures of him handcuffed, in Ukrainian military fatigues and looking bedraggled. Medvedchuk has since been in detention.Medvedchuk has denied the treason charges, saying they were falsified and part of a political plot against him. Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters on April 13 Medvedchuk had no back-channel communication with the Russian leadership.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_8>Lutsenko, the former Ukraine prosecutor general, told Reuters that before the Russian invasion, Medvedchuk used an encrypted telephone that was issued to him by the Kremlin, equipment reserved only for the most senior Russian officials and pro-Russian separatist leaders. Lutsenko said Ukrainian investigators had managed to hack the encrypted phone system, without disclosing what they found.Medvedchuk's lawyer, Tetyana Zhukovska, declined to comment until a court has handed down a decision in the case. The Ukrainian prosecutor's office did not comment.Another key figure, according to three sources familiar with the Russian plans, was Oleg Tsaryov, a square-jawed 52-year-old former member of Ukraine's parliament. He was picked by Kremlin invasion planners to lead the new interim government they planned to install, these sources said. Their comments are the first confirmation from within Russia of U.S. intelligence assessments, reported by the Financial Times earlier this year, that Moscow was considering putting Tsaryov in a leadership role in a puppet government in Kyiv.Tsaryov has been under Ukrainian andU.S. sanctions since 2014, when, after a bid to win election as Ukrainian president collapsed, he headed up a body called \"Novorossiya,\" or New Russia. The group pushed the idea of turning southeastern Ukraine into a separate pro-Russian statelet. By the start of this year, he was in Russian-annexed Crimea, where he owns two hotels.In the early hours of Feb. 24, at the start of the invasion, Tsaryov told his more than 200,000 Telegram followers he had crossed into Kyiv-controlled territory. \"I'm in Ukraine. Kyiv will be free from fascists.\"But Zelenskyy did not capitulate. Any expectations in Moscow that he would flee Kyiv or negotiate a deal that would cede to Russia's demands soon evaporated. In the weeks that followed, Ukrainian forces halted Russian troops' advance on Kyiv.Tsaryov never made it to the capital. On June 10, he posted an advertisement to his Telegram followers for his seaside hotel in Crimea, where a one-night stay costs 1,500 roubles ($28) per person per night. Tsaryov is now spending his time in Crimea with visits to Moscow, according to his .PARANOIA AND MISTRUSTRussia's campaign of infiltration did, however, stir suspicion and mistrust at some levels of the Ukrainian state, which hampered its ability to govern, especially in the first few days after the invasion.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_9>One stark incident that fuelled the tensions in Kyiv's power corridors related to the death in early March of Denys Kirieiev, a former bank executive, several sources said. He was a member of the Ukrainian delegation that took part in short-lived talks with Russian negotiators on the Ukraine-Belarus border, starting on Feb. 28. A photograph showed Kirieiev sitting alongside Ukrainian officials at the negotiating table.An advisor to the Zelenskyy administration said, in an online interview, that officers from the SBU shot Kirieiev while trying to arrest him as a Russian spy.But Ukraine's Military Intelligence Agency said Kirieiev was its employee and intelligence officer, and that he died a hero while conducting an unspecified special assignment defending Ukraine. A source close to the Ukrainian military told Reuters that Kirieiev was indeed a spy working for Ukraine. He had access to the highest levels of the Russian leadership, this source said, and was feeding back valuable information on invasion plans and other matters to his handlers in Kyiv.Amid the chaos early in the war, Bakanov, then the head of the SBU, left Kyiv for at least three days after the Russian invasion, according to three people in Ukrainian law enforcement. Two of these people said some SBU staff recounted they were unable to reach Bakanov for several days after Russia invaded. In suspending Bakanov on July 17, Zelenskyy cited an article in Ukraine's Armed Forces statute, under which servicemen can be relieved of their duties for improper conduct leading to casualties or a threat of casualties.Bakanov and the SBU did not respond to Reuters' questions.Zelenskyy, in his speech, stressed the toll Russian infiltration was taking on his embattled country by speaking of the numerous officials who have been accused of betraying Ukraine.\"Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state ... poses very serious questions to the relevant leaders,\" Zelenskyy said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/how-russia-spread-secret-web-agents-across-ukraine", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Vladimir President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after TIME magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1366_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/AP22025419607728-e1643493295324.jpg"}, {"caption": "Troops march during a rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade which will take place at Dvortsovaya (Palace) Square on May 9 to celebrate 77 years after the victory in World War II in St. Petersburg, Russia, Thursday, May 5, 2022.

Its goal is to support Ukrainian children by restoring the sports infrastructure of the war-torn country’s schools and launching a network of social sports clubs.\"We want to restore gyms because the Russian army bombed more than a hundred schools,\" he told The Associated Press by phone on Sunday. \"Our country, they need a lot of money to fix the schools.

Russia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov walked out of proceedings twice reports said Friday, first when his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock began to speak and again when Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba appeared on video. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_0>Lavrov said the global food crisis – a major issue slated for the November summit and a result of Russia’s naval blockade in the Black Sea – was not the fault of Moscow.\"If the West doesn’t want talks to take place but wishes for Ukraine to defeat Russia on the battlefield – because both views have been expressed – then perhaps there is nothing to talk about with the West,\" he said, according to a report by The Guardian.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart reportedly ignored each other outside the proceedings – which is the first time Lavrov has met with Western leaders since Russia’s deadly invasion of Ukraine in February. \"You know, it was not us who abandoned all contacts,\" Lavrov told reporters. \"It was the United States. And we are not running after anybody suggesting meetings. If they don’t want to talk, it’s their choice.\"Blinken reportedly directed pointed comments at Moscow during a closed-door meeting that Lavrov was not present for, accusing it of blocking millions of tons of grain and exacerbating a global food shortage. Lavrov’s sit-in apparently did not have a rebuttal to Blinken’s comments and said she did not have prepared remarks, according to one anonymous diplomat who attended the meeting.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_1>This week’s talks were intended to lay the groundwork for a summit set to be hosted by Indonesia in November, but the rocky diplomatic relations have set an uncertain tone for the upcoming conference.\"The world has yet to recover from the pandemic, but we are already confronted with another crisis: the war in Ukraine,\" Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said. \"The ripple effects are being felt globally on food, on energy and physical space.\"However, officials appeared to make a point to show their disinterest in working with Russia so long as the country continues its war in Ukraine and said there would be no joint communiqué as in previous years. Western officials apparently suggested they were focused on addressing food and energy shortages that have become a global problem following Moscow’s invasion and said they would work to establish bloc agreements to counter the growing global crises. However, the tone of the talks were of little surprise following the stops made by Western nations and officials from Russia and China prior to the G20 meeting in Bali. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_2>Lavrov, along with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, reportedly stopped in several Asian capitals to rally support for their position and bolster their shared ties. Blinken, along with his German, French and British counterparts have been meeting for months and attended NATO and G7 conferences over the last week.  The Indonesian host attempted to reign in the hostilities by reminding all attendees that the world is facing monumental crises that will have devastating effects if they are not remedied. Developing nations in the G20, like Argentina, Brazil India and Indonesia, could also face steep consequences if relations between the West remained strained with Russia and China.\"Honestly, we cannot deny that it has become more difficult for the world to sit together,\" Marsudi said. \"The world is watching us, so we cannot fail.\"Reports surfaced Friday alleging that Western nations refused to attend a group dinner Thursday evening after learning that Lavrov would be attending.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_3> The customary group photo was also abandoned in a boycott allegedly led by Blinken and G7 members, according to a report by Politico EU.Lavrov reportedly turned snappish when asked about the omitted group photo shoot and told reporters, \"I didn’t invite anyone to pose for a photo together with me.\"\"It’s obvious that they used the G20 for goals that weren’t envisaged when it was created,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/unity-g20-fails-differences-ukraine-war-russia-us-snub", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sips his drink prior to the start of the opening session of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, Friday, July 8, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/AP22189133392992-e1657294010526.jpg"}, {"caption": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a trilateral meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi at the G-20 Foreign Ministers Summit in Nusa Dua, on Indonesia's resort island of Bali Friday, July 8, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/AP22189380432219-1-e1657294207915.jpg"}, {"caption": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, left, meets with Argentine Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero, right, during the G-20 Foreign Ministers Summit in Nusa Dua, on Indonesia's resort island of Bali Friday, July 8, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/AP22189424045200-e1657294232232.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this handout photo released by Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, right, and Brazil Foreign Minister Carlos Alberto Franca walk during their bilateral meeting ahead of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, Friday, July 8, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1570_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/AP22189317429317-e1657294034799.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Ukraine war: American teenager transports 54 bags of medical supplies for Ukraine military", "body": "A 17-year-old from New York City helped organize and deliver medical supplies to Ukraine in an effort to bolster support for the country’s defense against Russian invasion. \"I was looking to help refugees,\" Matthew Geiling told Fox News Digital. \"That was what I was looking to do with ‘Ukraine Friends,’ but then as I learned more about the military side of it … how important the troops are to saving lives … I realized how much impact the medical supplies had on the military's humanitarian operations.\"\"That was one of the things I was pleasantly surprised with.\"Geiling initially raised money through a baseball fundraiser called \"HITS 4 HOPE,\" which directed its fundraising towards helping the Ukrainian refugees. Geiling is of Ukrainian descent, making the cause near and dear to him. Once he had the money, Geiling needed a way to direct it, which is how he linked up with Ukraine Friends. The group, founded shortly after the invasion began in 2022, consists of veterans, healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs who donate time and effort to supporting the Ukrainians through whatever means available. \"I stumbled across ‘Ukraine Friends,’ and I wanted to go and do more,\" Geiling explained, saying a family friend pointed him in their direction. \"I wanted to go and do more, so I gave my money to that organization and took a trip to deliver medical supplies.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_3><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_4>Geiling wanted to first support refugees, but the need for military medical supplies appeared more pressing. He traveled to the charity's warehouse on Long Island over the course of a week, where he helped pack and prepare the supplies for transport before setting out to Poland and Ukraine to deliver the supplies himself. From there, he drove the supplies into Ukraine from Poland, where he saw first-hand how the refugees suffered from the traumas of the war. The hardest part for Geiling was communicating throughout the process. \"I do a lot of volunteer work within my own community, and it's generally pretty easy because we share a common language,\" Geiling said. \"In Ukraine, it was challenging to communicate at the beginning, but I think we were able to overcome the language barrier towards the end of the mission at the Children's Hospital ... generally we were able to communicate through compassion and just being there for people,\" he added. Geiling's trip took place from June 24 to 30, and now that he is back in New York, he plans to continue helping when possible – including another trip to Ukraine this summer. \"I'm going to go package and load bags for more Ukrainian troops over the summer and just continue to help relief efforts out,\" he said. Ukraine Friends has booked close to 100 commercial flights to courier over 100 tons of medical supplies to Ukraine, including over 25,000 individual first aid kits to the front lines. The Geiling family delivery is the fourth such delivery the charity has organized, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/ukraine-war-american-teenager-transports-medical-supplies", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The Geiling Family helps 17-year-old son Matthew transport the 54 bags of medical supplies he helped prepare with the Ukraine Friends charity.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/image1.jpeg"}, {"caption": "The Geiling Family helps 17-year-old son Matthew transport the 54 bags of medical supplies he helped prepare with the Ukraine Friends charity.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/thumbnail_image0.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Geiling Family helps 17-year-old son Matthew transport the 54 bags of medical supplies he helped prepare with the Ukraine Friends charity.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/thumbnail_image2.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Geiling Family helps 17-year-old son Matthew transport the 54 bags of medical supplies he helped prepare with the Ukraine Friends charity.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/thumbnail_image5.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Geiling Family helps 17-year-old son Matthew transport the 54 bags of medical supplies he helped prepare with the Ukraine Friends charity.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1593_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/thumbnail_image3.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Ukrainian orphans stranded as American families struggle to save them from war", "body": "Hundreds of Ukrainian orphans who were set for U.S. adoptions are stuck in limbo as their prospective adoptive parents try to lobby authorities to give them a loving home.Americans Jenny Bradshaw and husband Holt, who hosted an eight-year-old orphan from Ukraine for one month earlier in the year, are part of a group of some 200 \"prospective adoptive parents\" looking to adopt from Ukraine.These international hosting programs are designed to give children a break from institutional life and give them a small window into what stable family life is like. Bradshaw and her family felt an immediate bond of love with the girl they were hosting and said that Katya would complete their family. When Katya returned home to Ukraine, the Bradshaws immediately began the international adoption process.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_0>Then, as the process got underway to bring Katya to the U.S., everything stopped as Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine.All international adoptions were quickly put on hold. Bradshaw and other families who can no longer complete the adoption process merely want to bring the children to the U.S. to provide temporary shelter while the war in Ukraine continues.Katya is from the Odesa region, which has experienced intense shelling from Russian forces since the war began Feb. 24. Thankfully for Bradshaw, the international adoption coordinator in Ukraine was able to provide Katya with a phone. The Bradshaws were able to keep in touch with her and know she was safe. Bradshaw was taking Russian language lessons, and Katya was able to speak some words in English.\"The lessons are usually enough to say, you know, ‘I love you. How are you?’ I'll ask her how her day is. I ask in Russian and she answers in English. But right there, after the invasion, she said this funny word ‘voyna’ a couple of times. And I put it to the translator, and it was the Russian word for war,\" Bradshaw said.They had contact virtually every day, and Bradshaw reminded Katya that the family had not forgotten about her.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_1>Odesa, which sits along the Black Sea in southwestern Ukraine, is a major port city and integral to the world economy. It’s also become a primary target for Russian forces trying to take control of Ukraine’s port cities.Shortly before Russia’s massive shelling of Odesa, Katya was evacuated to Romania in early March, briefly losing her phone along the way. Bradshaw made the journey to Romania in April to finally visit with Katya for a few days.And what she saw was disheartening.\"I watched Katya and other orphans playing on piles of construction debris with stray dogs roaming around,\" Bradshaw said. After meeting with her for a few hours over the course of four days, she found out from Romanian officials that she was to have no more contact with Katya.\"They will not give her letters. They will not give her packages,\" Bradshaw explained. She couldn’t even send basic essentials like underwear, socks and pajamas, and she was subject to a zero-tolerance policy from the authorities. Romanian officials won’t answer emails texts or relay any messages to Katya, she said.Bradshaw and her husband haven’t spoken to Katya in over two months.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_2> The family lives just outside Washington, D.C., in northern Virginia and has reached out to both of their U.S. senators — Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. But the senators' offices have told her that the problem was one of \"case work.\"\"Sen. Warner’s office is aware of ongoing issues surrounding adoptions from Ukraine,\" a spokesperson for Sen. Warner, D-Va., told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"The office is working (on) continuing to engage the State Department regarding the challenges families are facing in this process and working to facilitate lines of communication during this difficult time.\"Bradshaw has also met with a member of Kaine’s office, but there hasn’t been any progress.\"A member of Sen. Kaine’s team met with a group of parents facing issues in the adoption process in the wake of the war in Ukraine,\" a spokesperson for Sen Kaine, D-Va., told Fox News Digital. \"We are seeking additional information from the Biden administration on this matter and looking into steps we can take to help address these issues.\"Early on, the State Department was having regular calls with prospective adoptive parents but was unable to provide much information. \"It's kind of gotten lost in the halls of the State Department,\" Bradshaw lamented.Katya and other children who come to the U.S. for short-term hosting programs do so on non-immigrant visas. According to the U.S. State Department, children who entered the United States with a non-immigrant visa don’t qualify as orphans under U.S. immigration law, while Ukrainian law prohibits the adoption of Ukrainian children outside of Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has expressed concern to the U.S. about moving children out of Europe and traveling to the U.S.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_3>The problem is that prospective adoptive parents must work directly with Ukraine’s Adoption Authority for individual cases. So it’s basically out of the control of the U.S. government. Ukraine’s Ministry of Social Policy announced June 11 that hosting programs may resume in some cases but will not apply to children who are considered orphans. \"Adoptions are not possible at this time, and it can be extremely difficult in circumstances like the current conflict in Ukraine to determine whether children who appear to be orphans truly are eligible for intercountry adoption and immigration under U.S. laws,\" a State Department spokesperson said.Bradshaw continuously reminds public officials she understands adoptions are not possible now. She just wants to bring Katya to the U.S. for temporary shelter while Ukraine is still ravaged by Russia’s war.Children like Katya who travel to the United States for hosting programs do so with the Ukrainian government's authorization and on a U.S. non-immigrant visa that is valid for only one entry to the United States and only during the narrow date range of the program, according to the State Department. A child needs a new non-immigrant visa to travel to the U.S. again.The Bradshaws and other families want to provide temporary respite and remove children from harsh living conditions across Europe.\"We all say we want to be able to shelter these children in our homes, have them shelter with loving families instead of sheltering in dismal conditions across Europe,\" Bradshaw said.Kelly Dempsey, an attorney who represents some families, told Fox News Digital, \"The answers we get are adoption is not possible at this time.\" \"We believe that these families represent the single best tool of child protection available to these children and are advocating for the U.S. government to engage with Ukraine authorities to authorize the children to come to the U.S. temporarily while Ukraine is defending itself from Russia’s invasion and under martial law,\" Dempsey added.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_4>Dempsey has two specific requests for the U.S. government.\"Formally and specifically invite the children to the United States for respite care in the homes of U.S. families who know and love these children through the issuance of tourist visas,\" she said. \"And advocate and encourage Ukraine to authorize the children to be released to travel to the U.S. on tourist visas.\"Despite the pressure campaign in Congress, trepidation also remains among various international organizations. Save the Children, an organization that provides humanitarian aid to children in crisis and conflict zones and has a team on the ground in Ukraine, has also expressed concern over the risks of international adoptions during mass waves of refugees even though many of those looking to adopt children impacted by the crisis are well-meaning, the organization told Fox News Digital.Significant roadblocks remain ahead, but Bradshaw and other families are steadfast in their efforts to provide a loving home for Ukrainian children displaced by Putin’s war of aggression.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//politics/ukrainian-orphans-stranded-american-families-struggle-save-from-war", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Kayta, left, refers to the Bradshaws' two older daughters, twins Lauren and Elizabeth, as her American sisters.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Katya-and-her-American-sisters.jpg.jpg"}, {"caption": "First responders try to extinguish flames at a residential building in Odesa, Ukraine, July 1, 2022, following Russian missile attacks.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/ukraine-odesa-strike.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Bradshaw family has not spoken to Katya in over two months.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Katya-courtesy-Bradshaw-family.jpg"}, {"caption": "People cross the Ukrainian border to Siret, Romania, March 2, 2022, as they evacuate amid Russia´s invasion of Ukraine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1613_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Romania-Ukraine2.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Bradshaw family meet Katya for the first time at Dulles Airport last December.

I have ties with Russia because of my athleticism and my athletic career,\" Jones told Fox News Digital. \"It’s nothing political. It’s all about sports.\"Jones explained that back in the height of his boxing career, there were only two or three TV channels in Russia – and one of those channels was boxing. He said boxing became a very popular sport in the country as a result, and he was asked to train boxers to \"help them up their game.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1643_News_1>Jones, 53, is a dual U.S. and Russian citizen. He was operating a gym in Moscow where he trained young boxers before Russia's war with Ukraine forced him to shutter his operation. He hopes to someday return to continue his work with the aspiring fighters.\"If my athlete affiliations can help rectify the situation – why wouldn’t I try?\" he said of Griner's situation. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1643_News_2>\"So, I thought about it for a little while and one night I was sleeping and it hit me – what if it was my daughter stuck in a foreign country?\" Jones continued. \"They don’t speak no English and she don’t speak the language that they speak.

So, that thought alone terrified me.\"Jones said he reached out to his lawyer to get in contact with the White House. He also connected with a friend who knows people well-connected in Russian politics.Jones said his contact was able to reach authorities in Russia who expressed willingness to conduct a prisoner swap with the U.S. Jones said the process was slow moving and has since stalled. He’s hoping to continue to help facilitate future communication or negotiations as much as he’s able.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1643_News_3>Russian news media has repeatedly suggested that Griner could be swapped for Russian arms trader Viktor Bout, otherwise known as \"The Merchant of Death.\" Bout is serving a 25-year sentence on conviction of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organization.But U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would not disclose U.S. plans to bring Griner home when asked if a swap was being considered.Jones is still hopeful that Griner will be able to return home safely. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1643_News_4>\"I’m not a politician,\" he said. \"I don’t do all that. But if I can get her home, and they say they’re willing to do a prisoner swap and somebody here is willing to do that – then let’s make it happen.\"He continued, \"I would feel bad sitting there comfortable at night knowing she’s in that country in prison and I have citizenship in that country and I’m not trying to do nothing to help. That would be bad on my part.\"Jones said he has been unable to reach Griner or her family, but he’s open and willing to communicate should they reach out.\"This is what I do.

{"title": "Israel calls for new elections one month before Biden visit", "body": "Israel is headed to its fifth election in three years after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced Monday that efforts to stabilize his one-year-old fractious coalition had been exhausted, and, together with Alternate Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, he was dissolving the government.A bill to end the government’s term will be submitted next week for approval by Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, and parliamentary elections are expected to take place on Oct. 25, 2022.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1730_News_0>According to the coalition agreement between Bennett, Lapid, and eight other parties spanning the political spectrum, including for the first time an Arab-Israeli party, Lapid will now replace Bennett as a caretaker prime minister, while continuing as foreign minister. Bennett will take on the role of alternate prime minister and be responsible for dealing with Iran, Israeli media reported, with some suggesting that he is considering retiring completely from politics.In an emotional televised statement, Bennett said dissolving the government was a \"difficult moment but the right decision for the State of Israel.\"\"I decided to take on this very difficult position, but it was a Zionistic decision, and we created a government that was good for Israel,\" said Bennett, outlining the achievements made under his leadership, including tackling the two-year-old pandemic and reducing rocket fire from Palestinian militants Gaza.Regarding Lapid replacing him, Bennett said: \"I will do everything to ensure he succeeds.\"In his statement, Lapid thanked Bennett \"for putting the interests of the country ahead of his own\" and said, \"We will stay friends after this.\"Lapid urged the public to unite and not turn on each other through what could be a tumultuous election period. \"The country needs to continue functioning,\" he said, \"We still need to address matters like the high cost of living and the threat from Iran.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1730_News_1>The latest political developments mean that Lapid will be the one to greet President Biden when he visits Israel next month but it throws into uncertainty any plans to establish formal ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel.\"Biden’s Middle East foreign policy victory will likely have to wait,\" said Jonathan Schanzer, Senior Vice President, Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"Israel’s political system respects decisions made by previous governments, particularly with peace deals. Still, the optics of advancing normalization with a temporary government may not sit well with the Saudis.\"\"It also may not sit well with the White House,\" said Schanzer, adding however, \"It is important to underscore that the current upheaval will not derail the process of normalization — that’s already happening, it just may not be drawn out of the shadows yet.\"Bennett, 50, will be the shortest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history after he replaced Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister who held the role for 12 years. According to polls conducted in recent weeks, Netanyahu remains extremely popular and if an election was held right now, his Likud party would win the most number of seats in the Knesset but still not enough to form a government outright. In order to put together a viable government, any candidate needs the backing of at least 61 out of 120 Knesset members.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1730_News_2>A survey carried out last week by Israel’s Channel 12 News found that a collaboration of right-wing/religious parties headed by Netanyahu could reach that number, making it possible for him to successfully form the next government — a feat that eluded him following four previous national elections that took place between 2019-2021.The survey also found that the majority of the Israeli public is dissatisfied with the governing coalition, with more than half of those polled, 56 percent, of the opinion that Bennett’s government should not continue to exist.\"This is an evening of great news for the majority of the citizens in Israel,\" Netanyahu, who has led the opposition for the past year, said in a statement Monday. \"Following a focused fight by the opposition in the Knesset and great suffering of the Israeli public, it is clear to everyone that the most failed government in this country’s history has ended.\"Netanyahu said the government was dependent on \"terrorist supporters,\" a reference to the Arab party that was part of the coalition and has been accused of supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups. He also said the government had failed to keep the cost of living down, \"imposed unnecessary taxes and endangered the Jewish character of our country.\"He vowed to form broad, nationalist government headed by his Likud party.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1730_News_3>Bennett has been struggling since April when his coalition whip, Idit Silman, a member of Bennett’s own Yamina party, announced that she was resigning from the coalition over ideological differences. Last week, another member of Bennett’s party, Nir Orbach, also said he would no longer support the coalition in vital votes in the parliament.\"Tonight, we are unfortunately closing the chapter on the change government,\" Defense Minister Benny Gantz wrote on Twitter, referring to the government whose tagline was bringing change after Netanyahu’s leadership. \"A government whose year of activity has done much for Israeli society, its security, and resilience and will continue to work for it even during the transition period.\"Yohanan Plesner, President of the Israel Democracy Institute, said Bennett’s decision to disperse the Knesset showed that \"Israel’s worst political crisis did not end when this government was sworn into office, but rather merely receded only to return when this coalition failed to find a way to continue moving forward.\"\"While the Bennett-Lapid government undoubtedly played an important role by passing a budget and moving forward with other important legislation, this ongoing crisis will not come to an end until Israel’s leaders put their political differences aside and enact long-over-due electoral and constitutional reforms,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/israel-calls-for-new-elections-one-month-before-biden-visit", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1730_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett attends a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, Sunday, June 19, 2022.

{"title": "Ukrainian Animals War Relief Fund founded to save displaced pets after tech exec saw devastation firsthand", "body": "Americans are familiar with wrenching images and tragic stories of civilians killed or forced to flee war-torn Ukraine during Russia’s on-going invasion, but many overlook the pets left behind who must fend for themselves while navigating streets that are constantly under attack. That’s why tech entrepreneur Dan Fine founded Ukrainian Animals War Relief Fund (ARF), a nonprofit that is on a mission to save displaced Ukraine pets using cutting-edge technology, along with old-fashioned love and care. Fine, who has focused on his passion for animals since retiring from a successful career in tech, traveled to a Polish town alongside the Ukraine border earlier this year and volunteered to walk dogs and feed cats that suddenly became homeless following Russia’s invasion. He was close enough to hear missiles explode in Lviv and, along the way, saw devastating injuries to beloved animals that will haunt him forever.  \"I got a dog out of the hospital, and I'm taking him for a walk, and he lifts his leg to take a pee and his guts were hanging out. His guts were hanging out,\" Fine told Fox News Digital. \"And so I'm like, ‘Oh, my gosh,’ I took him back, and I'm trying to talk to the vet who doesn't speak English, and I just point them in, and he looks down, and he grabs the dog and takes him up into surgery… we had dogs that had been shot eight times and lost the ability to walk.\"  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_0>One dog named Pablo was shot eight times and needed surgery to have bullets removed from him. The heartbreaking stories are endless.  \"There was another dog a friend of mine wanted to adopt that I was willing to bring home. But then the veterinarian showed me his X-ray and he had shrapnel throughout his spine and he had to be operated on,\" Fine said. \"This is a horrific, horrific situation that, you know, needs attention.\" Fine even found himself making wheelchairs out of pipe and Velcro to help transport injured dogs. An early internet pioneer who developed websites for hundreds of major corporations, Fine launched ARF to help dogs and cats that are victims of the war in Ukraine.\"While I was there, I saw the kind of efforts that went towards humans. And I believe in that, right? I'm not saying animals over people, but, you know, the Red Cross, their World Central Kitchen is there. They have tons of technology. The military is there. They've got busses, they've got all kinds of things because we're used to doing this. We do it in Syria, we do it in Libya. We do it in Afghanistan. We take care of people,\" Fine said. \"But what I found out, and I did the research on this, animals have no rights.\"  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_1>He then helped put together a portal to connect independent volunteers with warehouses and shelters to bring some order to the Ukrainian shelter system.  \"The shelters are all throwing their hands up, going, ‘Send me stuff,’ and then volunteers just go in and deliver it at great risk and then, we don't know, some shelters are not getting anything and some shelters are getting too much,\" he said. \"So we approached Microsoft and we put together a portal that gives visibility to all the shelters, all the drivers, all the warehouses, so we know that this is a real warehouse. They got 600 dogs and 100 cats and this is how much food they need, and then we can start using like predictive technology to figure out what the supply chain should be fixed for that.\"  Fine also used his background and connections to establish a technology platform powered by Microsoft’s not-for-profit social initiative to help catalog abandoned pets to help reunite them with Ukrainians who were forced to flee the nation.  \"There's easily a million stray animals right now, if not two million wandering around Ukraine looking for food, and they're going to start mating, and they're in shelters that don't have protection because they don't have enough cages. You're going to have a huge problem,\" Fine said. \"So we said, we need to set up mobile units to go over there and spay, neuter, vaccinate these animals. And then we thought about, and we said, ‘Well, let's work that with Microsoft and put in a chip or read their chips and try to reunite them with their owners,'\" he continued. \"So we decided to... create kind of the largest blockchain in a record of Ukrainian animals so that when people can go back to their homes or if they're set up a new home in Italy or Spain or France, they'll be able to connect and reconnect with their dog or cat.\"  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_2>Fine doesn’t want anyone across the world to think the pets were abandoned because dogs and cats simply aren’t beloved in Ukraine. He explained that panicked civilians made a beeline, often with children in hand, to exit the country as roads and bridges were being destroyed by Russian troops. But often, so many people were attempting to cram into busses or trains that there wasn’t room for luggage, let alone pets. The tragic circumstance didn’t provide much of a choice for Ukrainian pet owners who needed to get out of harm’s way before it was too late.  \"I can’t even imagine leaving my baby behind, and they’re forced to do that,\" he said. \"I couldn’t imagine the heartbreak… it’s like having a five-year old child and I just can’t imagine leaving them alone to try to figure this thing out on their own and feed themselves.\"  Fine said the need for animal rights during wartime – which he plans to lobby the government to assist with – came to light when Feldman EcoPark, a zoo located near the city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine, was devastated by Russian forces.  \"A Russian sniper had killed the zookeeper and stuffed him in the bathroom… then the Russians came in 48 hours [later] and, this is documented, they used the rest of the animals as target practice. Now, this is where I've got a rub. This is where I've got a problem,\" he said. \"They have zero rights, and so the Russians can come over and just shoot as many as they want. And there's zero accountability. There's no accountability for that, and that's completely wrong. These are people's pets. We domesticated them,\" he said. \"We owe them the right to take care of them and to look after them… so one of the things that our Ukrainian War Animal Relief fund wants to do is lobby the government to try to get rights for animals during war.\" Fine hopes major animal charities across the globe work with ARF and employ the technology the foundation has developed to help as many animals as possible, such as Ukraine zoo animals who've been affected in the war. In the meantime, he hopes to bring awareness and raise money to help the displaced pets in Ukraine.  \"It's kind of a cool project because it's not just a rescue and relief fund. It really is thinking proactively about the future by using technology and adding intelligence and kind of smarts into the system. And, you know, if you care about animals, it's more than just going in and walking dogs. I mean, I found that really beneficial for me, but it's a drop in the bucket,\" he said.  \"We have to affect a lot more animals, millions. And the only way to do that, to be smart about it, is using technology. So one of the things we want to do is if people do donate to us and share our information about our Go Fund Me, we're going to create an NFT for them of one of those animals. An NFT is a non-fungible token up on the blockchain,\" Fine continued. \"Our hope is to have, you know, the most complete blockchain database of Ukrainian animals that people will be able to search, either if they want to adopt or if they want to buy an NFT and invest into the crypto world, or if they want to be able to just reunite with their animals.\"  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_3>Fine’s first trip to help the animals of Ukraine was motivated by Lawrence Anthony's work about an elephant sanctuary, \"The Elephant Whisperer,\" and the journey resulted in the creation of ARF. \"At the back of the book he talks about during the Iraq war, he and his son went to the Baghdad Zoo to take care of the animals… the distress, the PTSD that they suffer from bombs being dropped around you are so sad,\" Fine said. \"So, he went over to help, and I thought, ‘Hey, I could do this.’\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//media/ukrainian-animals-war-relief-fund-founded-save-displaced-pets-tech-exec-devastation-firsthand", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Tech entrepreneur Dan Fine founded Ukrainian Animals War Relief Fund (ARF), a nonprofit that is on a mission to save displaced Ukraine pets.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/dan-fines-ukraine.png"}, {"caption": "Two stray puppies look up at the camera in an image given to Fox News Digital from the Ukrainian Animals War Relief Fund.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/puppies-odesza.png"}, {"caption": "A dog in a wheelchair looks up at another dog in a picture given to Fox News Digital by the Ukrainian Animals War Relief.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/dog-wheelchair.png"}, {"caption": "\"The Elephant Whisperer,\" written by Lawrence Anthony with Graham Spence, inspired Dan Fine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1732_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/elephant-whisperer.png"}]}
{"title": "Mayor Eric Adams ready to back naming street honoring Otto Warmbier", "body": "Otto Warmbier would be a New Yorker today. The 27-year-old would be waking up this morning in Manhattan, a quiet Sunday off from his Wall Street investment job at the noted investment firm Guggenheim Securities, which bought the firm, Millstein investments, that gave Otto an internship the summer of 2016 and job lined up after his graduation from the University of Virginia.Otto perhaps would be living in the Churchill Apartment building, along with similar other young professionals, on Second Avenue and 40th street, where a friend snapped a photo of him waiting on the building's curb during the summer of 2015.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News_0>But the unforgiving regime of Kim Jong Un denied the young American a future when he was falsely arrested, imprisoned for a year and a half, and sent home to die, severely brain-damaged, unable to speak, see or hear, the result of his torture by his North Korean captors. He was taken off life support in a Cincinnati hospital five years ago today. Otto Warmbier was 22 years old.In death, Otto has become an international symbol of human rights and of the struggle for the North Korean people, and those seeking human dignity and freedom elsewhere. He was honored at the 2018 State of the Union when his parents, Cindy and Fred, sister Greta and brother Austin were given an emotional standing ovation by the packed House chamber in honor of Otto's memory. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News_1>On Thursday, the U.S. Senate passed the Otto Warmbier North Korea Censorship and Surveillance Act, sponsored by Senators Rob Portman R-Ohio., Sherrod Brown D-Ohio., and Chris Coons D-Del. which \"provides $10 million annually for the next five years to counter North Korea's repressive censorship and surveillance state, while also encouraging sanctions on those who enable this repressive information environment both in and outside of North Korea.\"\"This legislation will help ensure that his memory lives on and that the brutal regime responsible for his unjust death is held accountable for this and its myriad of other human rights abuses,\" says Sen. Portman. \"Otto Warmbier's treatment by North Korean authorities that ended in his death remains a powerful reminder of the brutality of Kim Jong Un's regime,\" says Sen. Brown. \"This legislation reaffirms our commitment to combating North Korea's human rights violations against its own people and others who have been held captive.\"But another honor has been in the works, three blocks from where Otto was pictured waiting outside on that hot Manhattan summer day.\"Otto Warmbier Way\" is the proposal to name the street in front of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations on Second Avenue and 44th street, in front of 820 Second Avenue, where Kim Jong Un's diplomats have their offices, just one block from the United Nations. The honorary street renaming, seen as a defiant, moral message to Kim's diplomats and a compelling reminder of the regime's harsh realities to the international community, has impressive bi-partisan support, including New York City Mayor Eric Adams. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News_2>\"Mayor Adams wholeheartedly condemns the human rights abuses committed by North Korea and has nothing but sympathy for the loss the Warmbier family suffered when Otto was taken from them. If the City Council chooses a street for renaming in Otto’s name, the mayor would support those efforts,\" the Mayor's Press Secretary Fabien Levy told Fox News.\"Otto Warmbier Way\" is also endorsed by: two former U.S. Secretaries of State, Mike Pompeo and John Kerry, Mayor Adams' predecessor Bill de Blasio, three former United States Ambassadors to the United Nations, including former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, two U.S. Senators who are members of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, two Korean American members of Congress, the current and past Manhattan Borough President, the district's Congresswoman, New York States Assemblyman, as well as human rights activists and others. But it has yet to be voted on by the New York City Council, which is responsible for the honorary street renamings, despite first being proposed in 2019.In a tweet on Thursday, Otto's mother, Cindy, put the blame for the lack of action, despite the heavyweight support, squarely on one New York elected official.  Mrs. Warmbier tweeted: \"There is a city council member in New York City who has obstructed our efforts to name street by North Korean UN Mission Otto Warmbier Way. Who can help us with this?\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News_3>She was responding to the naming of the Washington, D.C. street outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy \"Jamal Khashoggi Way,' after the Washington Post Columnist who was murdered inside the Kingdom's Istanbul embassy, allegedly on the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has denied it.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News_4>In her tweet, Mrs. Warmbier was referring to New York City Council Member Keith Powers, a Democrat from Manhattan, whose district includes the North Korean U.N. mission location. He is the local official who would be responsible for introducing the street renaming bill, absent other City Council action.   Although Council Member Powers expressed support for Otto's human rights honor when it was first raised three years ago, his office has told Fox News in the past that the proposal was sitting in the council's legal department. The street renamings traditionally honor police officers and firefighters who have died in the line of duty, as well as members of the military who have given the ultimate sacrifice as well as local community activists and other local notables. But plenty of other names have made it to the street signs ...some with no connection to the location… and have included rock and roll, rap and bee-bop music groups, foreign dignitaries, and Major League baseball players and beloved restaurant and bar owners, among others.In 2018 the naming of a Brooklyn street \"Jean-Jacques Dessalines Boulevard,\" after the Haitian revolutionary who led his nation to independence against France sparked controversy. Dessalines is blamed for ordering the massacre of up to 10,000 white French residents in 1804.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News_5>The current package of 79 names that was approved at the City Council meeting on June 16th, include the Beastie Boys (Beastie Boys Square,) the R & B vocal group The Force MD's (The Force MD's Way,) as well as signs honoring local communities such as \"Ukrainian Way,\" \"Little Bangladesh Way,\" and \"Little Thailand Way.\"The official renaming of a Bronx street that was approved last December after former Albanian prime minister Fan Noli, \"Fan Noli Way,\" was briefly delayed earlier this year by a council member change. Noli served as Albania's prime minister in 1924.Last year 199 names were approved, including honoring the late media billionaire Sumner Redstone, the late Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, \"Ibrahim al-Hamdi Way\" for the former president of Yemen who was assassinated in 1977, a Napalese Mountain sherpa, U.S. Navy victims of Pearl Harbor, Tin Pan Alley songwriters from the early 1920's, as well as famed New York Yankee Phil \"Scooter\" Rizutto. \"New York City should still use this opportunity to rename the street and thumb our nose at the North Korean dictatorship. Otto's life could matter even more as a strong sign against totalitarianism,\" says New York City Council Member Joe Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island, who raised the issue and met with the Warmbiers in 2019, as did Council Member Powers.Former Manhattan Borough President and current Democratic city council member, Gale Brewer noted that \"Manhattanites –and all New Yorkers –have always cared about the larger world because so many of us came from elsewhere. So it’s personal for us to always seek justice on the global stage…and co-naming Second Avenue from 43rd to 44th Streets is one small way we can keep Otto’s memory alive.\"Council Member Powers' office did not respond to a request for comment regarding Mrs. Warmbier's tweet or the councilman's current position on honoring the memory of Otto Warmbier.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/mayor-eric-adams-ready-back-naming-street-honoring-otto-warmbier", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Otto Warmbier seen sitting at the Churchill apartment building in Manhattan, at 40th Street and Second Avenue, just three blocks from what could be \"Otto Warmbier Way.\" On 43rd Street and Second Avenue in front of the North Korean Mission to the U.N.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1746_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/06/Otto-Warmbier-in-NYC-courtesy-Warmbier-family-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill named after Otto Warmbier.

{"title": "Fox News Poll: Six in ten favor US continuing to provide aid to Ukraine", "body": "Voters want to keep helping Ukraine fight Russia, even as their sense of the war’s relevancy declines, according to a new Fox News survey.  Six in 10 favor the United States continuing to provide weapons (61%) and financial aid (59%) to Ukraine. That is unchanged since March when a similar number said the U.S. should \"be doing more\" to help in the fight.  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1766_News_0>Voters are also not buying White House attempts to tie current gas prices to the war. By an 18-point margin, they say Presiden Joe Biden’s policies are more responsible for prices at the pump than Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine (50-32%).  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1766_News_1>While voters support continued aid to Ukraine, fewer now think what happens there makes a difference at home. Some 78% say the war matters at least some to life in the U.S., down from 85% in both April and March. In addition, the 41% saying it matters a great deal is down 10 points. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1766_News_2>The overall 7-point decline comes from a drop in the number of Republicans (-10 points) and independents (-9) thinking Ukraine matters, as views among Democrats mostly held steady (-2).Three-quarters of Democrats favor sending more weapons and financial aid to Ukraine, compared to around half of Republicans and independents. Russia invaded Ukraine nearly four months ago (Feb. 24). Since then, the U.S. has spent more than $55 billion dollars on the war -- including an additional $1 billion in weapons and $225 million in humanitarian aid announced Thursday.  When asked which party can better handle foreign policy, voters pick Republicans over Democrats by 8 points.  Yet as inflation dominates, foreign policy is a lesser priority these days.

U.S. servicemen Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, were reported missing earlier this week following the June 9 skirmish with Russian forces, and the State Department announced Thursday that a third U.S. citizen is also nowhere to be found. Drueke, a former U.S. Army staff sergeant who served two tours in Iraq and a Ukrainian Army volunteer, was part of a Ukrainian platoon that came under heavy fire on June 9 while holding a strategic position, and when the platoon dropped back, everyone was accounted for except Dureke and Huynh, Drueke's family said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Ground and drone surveys have not displayed any sign of Drueke thus far. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1765_News_0>\"This could mean they are in hiding or it could mean they have been captured,\" Drueke’s mother, Bunny Drueke, said in a statement.

Drueke left the U.S. in mid-April and entered Ukraine through Poland. He made contact with Ukrainian forces from there and helped train soldiers operating drones and other weaponry before being assigned to a platoon.\"When Russia invaded Ukraine, Alex immediately told me he wanted to go use his skills to train Ukrainians in how to operate American weaponry,\" Bunny Drueke said. \"He isn’t married, he doesn’t have kids, and he has the training and the experience.

He had been hiking the Appalachian Trail in early 2020 before it was shut down due to COVID-19 and had been living in rural West Alabama until leaving for Ukraine. Huynh, a former Marine, also reportedly traveled from his home state of Alabama to  in April, has not been heard from since June 8 when he told his fiancee, Joy Black, that he would be unreachable for the next \"few days.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1765_News_3>\"He was telling me for a few days that ‘I’m going to be busy soon,'\" Black previously told Fox News Digital. \"He didn’t tell me what specifically because I don’t think he wanted to worry me.\"The State Department told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that it was aware of unconfirmed reports of the two missing Americans.

{"title": "Former special operations soldier returns to Iraq — but this time with her Harvard master's degrees", "body": "Like many students, it took Shelane Etchison time to adjust to graduate school. Perhaps less typical, she had to figure out how to simultaneously juggle two Ivy League master's programs.But maybe Etchison's most unique adjustment was adapting to civilian life after spending years hunting high-value targets in places like Afghanistan and Syria as one of the first female soldiers to serve in a special operations unit, let alone a combat role. \"I've had to work to be more conscious and deliberate about what is my next purpose and mission, who is part of my new tribe?\" Etchison, 36, told Fox News. \"That can be challenging. It's been lonely and kind of strange at times.\"\"But in the last year, through getting help with the [Department of Veterans Affairs] and starting to build some friendships in school, you start to see the opportunities and possibilities that the civilian world can give you,\" Etchison continued.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_0>The Florida native, who recently graduated with two master's degrees from Harvard University, settled on her next mission: returning to her old stomping grounds abroad. But this time, Etchison aims to help develop the war-torn countries’ economies, rather than take up arms.Like many servicemembers of her generation, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks compelled Etchison, who was in high school at the time, to join the Army.\"It's surprising to my family that I ended up joining the military,\" she told Fox News. \"It's even surprising to myself.\"\"I decided I wanted to be as close to the front lines and what we are actually doing to combat terrorism,\" Etchison continued.After finishing college as an ROTC student, however, the new Army officer was kept far from the fighting.\"It was disheartening and frustrating, frankly, that by virtue of being a woman and that alone I was not allowed to go into the parts of the military that would be closest to actually combating terrorism,\" Etchison said.But she soon had the opportunity, not just to fight, but to become part of the founding class of specially trained female fighters.Special operations forces in Afghanistan, like the Army Rangers and the Navy SEALs, were hunting high-value Taliban and al Qaeda targets, but faced a major obstacle: cultural norms forbid American men from talking with Afghan women, meaning the U.S. military was losing out on a major source of intelligence.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_1>\"The women know what's going on in their village,\" Etchison said. \"They know what's going on in their homes. And so we were leaving potentially tons of vital intelligence that they know just untapped.\"\"So, if it's only women who could talk to these Afghan women, then they need to recruit only women to do this job,\" the veteran continued. But \"at the time, there weren't women in any of these special operations units. The military banned women from even trying out to be in these units.\"Three years into Etchison’s career, the Army aimed to close that gap. In 2011, it formed Cultural Support Team, an all-female fighting force within the 75th Ranger Regiment that would work alongside a team of Afghan women trained for combat by their own military.\"It seemed almost like: 'here, this is the time, this is the chance,'\" Etchison told Fox News. \"This is unprecedented that the military's looking for women to fulfill these jobs in these combat roles and doing so within special operations units.\"Etchison joined part of the 20-woman inaugural team, making her one of the first women in U.S. history to join men on the front lines, let alone special operations.\"Myself and my female colleagues in the Cultural Support Teams,\" Etchison said, \"we just did it.\"\"From the application process, through the challenging selection process, we were run into the ground, given like no sleep, given all these different physical challenges, mental challenges, the training,\" Etchison continued. \"Then our deployment, from literally surviving Afghanistan, winning over our male colleagues, proving our place in this organization, making a mark for women in the military ahead. And just creating such solid bonds with our group of women.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_2>Etchison’s accomplishments, achieved so young, created a new challenge.\"You really questioned ‘did I peak at 25 years old?’\" she said. \"Is the most consequential thing that I am going to accomplish already done?\"\"And kind of grappling with 'what do I do now?' was challenging,\" Etchison added.She began seeing limits to the military, that there was only so much she could do as a servicewoman to help people in war-torn countries.\"Impact in the armed forces only goes so far,\" Etchison told Fox News. \"A lot of the places I deployed to – Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Europe—there needs to be more than military intervention to solve these problems. That was so clear in these places I went to.\"She ultimately decided her path was outside the military. The Army major left after 11 years in the service.\"The reasons why I decided to leave were very, very challenging to come to,\" Etchison told Fox News. \"And I did not take it lightly, but I personally felt like it's a hard, fast, demanding life. And there were certain personal tolls that were being taken.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_3>She eventually resolved that helping these countries she grew to cherish would be her new mission – but this time, through peace.\"I wanted to go to school to be able to bring further impact to these places that I really do care deeply about and have great people that are worthy of a stable, secure life,\" Etchison told Fox News. \"And to me, that looked like transitioning from the security apparatus to other apparatuses of development, like in economic development and economic opportunities in these places.\"\"I had to get out of the military to be able to do that,\" Etchison added.Etchison said her time in the armed forces and specifically her experience with the Cultural Support Team inspired her to apply to Harvard.The Army \"just challenges you and pushes you beyond what you think you’re capable of,\" Etchison told Fox News. \"And the cultural support team just put that on a rocket ship for me.\"\"I thought, you know, there's no reason to put limits. I'll apply to Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School of Government,\" she told Fox News. \"I ended up getting into both.\"But Etchison’s transition out of the military wasn’t easy, starting Ivy League dual master's programs aside.\"There is a sudden loss of community, identity, purpose,\" she said. \"You go from an organization where literally your squad leader or whoever's in charge of you, their job is to have personal accountability of you every day.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_4>\"And then you go to the civilian world where no one needs to call you. No one needs to check up on you,\" Etchison continued. \"It took probably a year and a half for me to start to feel better.\"She broke down her former sense of direction – suddenly eliminated from her daily life – into simple terms.\"The military kind of hands you your purpose,\" Etchison told Fox News. \"Here's your mission. Here's your teammates. Work together. Accomplish said mission.\"\"That just feeds so much into our tribal brain of working together and accomplishing something,\" Etchison continued.Her experience with the Cultural Support Team, however, helped her overcome these challenges and reorient herself.\"The Cultural Support Team Program—seeing that through and being successful in it was a life lesson that you really shouldn't put limits on yourself,\" Etichson said. \"And also a lesson that challenge is good.\"In May, Etchison graduated with master's degrees in public policy and business administration. She starts an economic development job later this month in Iraq.\"It’s a starting point into exploring … going back into post-conflict zones and what else stability looks like besides just military intervention,\" Etchison said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/former-army-ranger-returns-to-iraq-this-time-harvard-masters-degrees", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Shelene Etchison, one of the first women allowed in a combat role, trains in preparation for deployment.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/shelane-etchison-holds-rifle.jpg"}, {"caption": "Shelane Etchison discusses transitioning from Army special operations to two Harvard master's programs.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/shelane-etchison-interview.jpg"}, {"caption": "Shelane Etchison gathers information about the Taliban from women and children in the Helmand Province.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/shelane-etchison-kids.jpg"}, {"caption": "Shelane Etchison, a former special operations soldier, works on two Harvard master's degrees.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/shelane-etchison-studying.jpg"}, {"caption": "Shelane Etchison in her graduation robes after completing two master's programs at Harvard University.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_1813_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/shelane-etchison-graduation.jpg"}]}

They truly believe that the direction is towards a classically liberal, democratic society integrated with western values.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1857_News_0>The Army veteran was a member of the Army’s Military Police Corps between 2006-2011 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009-2010.

They’re the underdogs. I understand the tactics of an underdog having fought the underdog while being the superior power.\"The sense of hardness that you develop from being on a combat deployment and training and being in this operational mindset prepares you, but it doesn’t prepare you for the level of intensity of combat\" currently going on in Ukraine, he said.But the Army veteran noted the morale and will of the Ukrainian people to fight for their country makes up for what some of them lack in basic combat skills and experience.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_1857_News_3>\"They’ve built up this national identity of who they are so quickly and it has become so united,\" he said. \"The Ukrainian Army doesn’t lack motivation to fight… hundreds of thousands of people are being brought to service.\"He noted a lot of the people volunteering for service have \"major gaps\" in their knowledge of basic military tactics and \"usage of modern combat tourniquets and casualty treatment.\"But their motivation to fight against a Russian invasion makes them ideal to train.\"They keep asking questions and they want deeper knowledge,\" he said.\"They’re willing to fight to the last man,\" he continued. \"These people will fight to the last man and these people inspire me every day.\"The American noted that he will at some point be bound for the front lines himself, where he hopes people back home in the U.S. will continue to be supportive of the Ukrainian war effort.\"The fact that Americans back Ukraine, to them, is the deepest sentiment,\" he said. \"You walk the streets of Ukraine and ask them ‘what do you think of Americans?’ These people will say ‘we love Americans.’ We never got this type of love in Afghanistan, we never got this type of love in Iraq.

{"title": "Ukrainian town's resistance halted Russian troops", "body": "The Russians began arriving in Borodyanka on the first day of March. Initial western intelligence indicated Putin’s forces believed they would roll down through Chernobyl, using Ukraine’s highways to enter the capital within days. They were told they would be greeted with open arms, welcomed as liberators. But in this nondescript city an hour northeast of Kyiv, Russian forces encountered resistance for the first time, bogging down in the fields as Ukrainian territorial defense forces launched guerrilla attacks on supply lines. The resistance in Borodyanka surprised and confused the Russians, who then provided a preview of the brutal tactics Putin’s forces are using to try and force Ukraine into submission. On March 2, with advancement stalled, the bombings began. Anatoliy Rudnichenko, an advisor to the mayor, was here when his city was relentlessly shelled told Fox News Digital, \"There was no reason for this town to be bombed,\" he said. \" There were no strategic targets, no military here.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2021_News_0>The civilian population in Borodyanka posed no threat. Nonetheless, Russian planes dropped 250kg and 500kg bombs on residential buildings. On the city’s main street, a nine-story block of apartments is now two separate buildings, the middle part completely demolished.  Before the war this was a community of 15,000 people and according to local authorities at least 150 were killed, 41 more remain missing, believed to be buried in the rubble. Russian forces held Borodyanka for a month.  A woman we spoke to recounted strict measures enforced by troops.  \"It was very bad.  They were commanding us.  It was not like life,\" she said. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2021_News_1>Ukrainian forces blew up nearby bridges, effectively preventing Russian advancement.  Similar battles were underway in Bucha and Irpin. The attack was relentless, night after night residents sought shelter in basements, until on April 2 the Russians withdrew.  But not before they mined the city’s parks.  Each street and building had to be carefully swept. The damage in Borodyanka is shocking. Blackened buildings stand as a testament to what happened here. Shattered windows offering a glimpse of lives interrupted, in one building jeans and laundry flutter on a clothesline. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2021_News_2>The supermarket was damaged and has yet to reopen.  Many of the 5,000 people who remain here make their way daily to the city’s central square and line up for aid. On this day it’s food from Canada.  Bags of long grain rice and small plastic containers of potted meats. The aid organization traveled here from Kyiv and also brings dog and cat food. As one woman walked away, her bag safely stowed under her arm she said \"bring us peace. You can help us, bring us peace.\"Investigators from the International Criminal Court (ICC,) are here. Like so many other places, brutal atrocities were committed. The buildings might be destroyed, but adjacent trees somehow survived, their green leaves providing shade from a hot spring day. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2021_News_3>In the city’s square sits a statue of Taras Shevchenko, the most important Ukrainian poet of the 19th century. In 1847 he was imprisoned by the Russian court for promoting Ukrainian independence. A national hero, all these years later he suffered the indignity of his likeness being peppered with bullets. In his poem ‘Testament’ he wrote, ‘Oh bury me, then rise ye upAnd break your heavy chainsAnd water with the tyrants’ bloodThe freedom you have gained.’For Ukrainians, Shevchenko’s words still ring true to this day.

And one is certain his brother was killed by the country’s security forces.What united them is their determination to resist Lukashenko by fighting against Russian forces in Ukraine.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_0>Belarusians are among those who have answered a call by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for foreign fighters to go to Ukraine and join the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine, given the high stakes in a conflict which many see as a battle pitting dictatorship against freedom.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_1>For the Belarusians, who consider Ukrainians a brethren nation, the stakes feel especially high.Russian troops used Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine early in the war, and Lukashenko has publicly stood by longtime ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, describing him as his \"big brother.\" Russia, for its part, has pumped billions of dollars into shoring up Lukashenko's Soviet-style, state-controlled economy with cheap energy and loans. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_2>Weakening Putin, the Belarusian volunteers believe, would also weaken Lukashenko, who has held power since 1994, and create an opening to topple his oppressive government and bring democratic change to the nation of nearly 10 million.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_3>For many of the Belarusians, their base is Poland, a country on NATO's eastern flank that borders Belarus and Ukraine and which has become a haven for pro-democracy Belarusian dissidents before becoming one for war refugees from Ukraine. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_4>Some of the volunteer fighters are already in Poland, and some only pass through briefly on their way to Ukraine.\"We understand that it's a long journey to free Belarus and the journey starts in Ukraine,\" said Vadim Prokopiev, a 50-year-old businessman who used to run restaurants in Minsk. He fled the country after a rumor spread that he would be arrested for saying publicly that the government wasn’t doing enough for small businesses.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_5>\"When the Ukraine war will be eventually over, our war will just start. It is impossible to free the country of Belarus without driving Putin's fascist troops out of Ukraine,\" he said.Prokopiev heads a unit called \"Pahonia\" that has been training recruits. The Associated Press interviewed him as he oversaw an exercise involving firing pistols and other weapons into old cars in simulations of war scenarios. They were being trained by a Polish ex-police officer who is now a private shooting instructor.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_6>Prokopiev wants his men to gain critical battle experience, and he hopes that one day soon a window of opportunity will open for democratic change in Belarus. But he says it will require fighters like himself to be prepared, and for members of the security forces in Belarus to turn against Lukashenko.The 2020 presidential election in Belarus was widely seen as fraudulent, but massive street protests against Lukashenko being awarded a sixth term were met with a brutal government crackdown, leading to Prokopiev's belief that no \"velvet revolution\" can be expected in Belarus.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_7>\"Power from Lukashenko can only be taken by force,\" he said.On Saturday, men with another unit, Kastus Kalinouski, gathered in Warsaw in the Belarus House, where sleeping bags, mats and other Ukraine-bound equipment were piled high. They sat together, talking and snacking on chocolate and coffee as they prepared to deploy to Ukraine later in the day. Most didn't want to be interviewed out of concerns for their security and that of family back home.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_8>The regiment, formally part of Ukraine's armed forces, was named after the leader of an anti-Russian insurrection in the 19th century who is viewed as a national hero in Belarus.Lukashenko has called them \"crazy Belarusian citizens,\" and authorities have put 50 members of Kastus Kalinouski on a wanted list and initiated criminal cases against them.One willing to describe his motivations was a 19-year-old, Ales, who has lived in Poland since last year. He fled Belarus after the country's security service, which is still called the KGB, detained him and forced him to denounce an anti-Lukashenko resistance group in a video. He was told he would be jailed if he didn’t comply.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_9>Dressed all in black from a hooded sweatshirt to his boots, he admitted to feeling nervous as the moment arrived to head into Ukraine. He had never received any military training, but would get it once he arrived in Ukraine. But just how much, and where he would be deployed, he didn't yet know.He said he was going to fight not only to help Ukraine \"but to make Belarus independent.\" He said it was also important for him that people realize that the Belarusian people are very different from the Lukashenko government.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_10>It is a dangerous mission. At least four volunteers from the Kastus Kalinouski unit have already died. A deputy commander, Aliaksiej Skoblia, was killed in a Russian ambush near Kyiv and was later recognized by Zelenskyy as a Hero of Ukraine.Still, the fighting in Ukraine can feel less dangerous at times than seeking to resist Lukashenko at home, where many activists are in prison facing harsh conditions.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News_11>Organizing the Kastus Kalinouski recruits was Pavel Kukhta, a 24-year-old who already fought in Ukraine's Donbas region in 2016, suffering burns and the loss of most of hearing in one ear. Kukhta said his half-brother, Nikita Krivtsov, was found dead by hanging in a wooded area outside Minsk in 2020. Police said there was no evidence of foul play but Kukhta says he and the rest of the family are certain Krivtsov was killed for joining the anti-Lukashenko protests.But he insisted that his support for Ukraine is not about revenge, only about fighting for democratic change.\"If Putin is defeated, Lukashenko will be defeated,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/belarus-volunteers-ukraine-russia", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2046_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Volunteers from Belarus train at a shooting range near Warsaw, Poland, on Friday, May 20, 2022.

{"title": "Reporter's Notebook: Putin's war continues, but Ukrainian spirits are still high", "body": "Driving through western Ukraine there’s little evidence of war, yet the threat of attack from Russian cruise missiles is constant. Military checkpoints are everywhere, usually constructed of old tires and sandbags, the Ukrainian blue and yellow flag fluttering proudly in gentle spring breezes, mirroring the sky and golden fields or rapeseed that stretch to the horizon.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2085_News_0>I’d describe Lviv as a combination of Paris and Rome – its cobblestone streets lined with stately homes over which tower the spires and domes of ancient churches. It’s a city that’s enjoying spring, even in the midst of conflict. Having been here in the cold depths of winter when refugees arrived by the thousands at the train station and people hunkered down in anticipation of Russian attack, it’s surreal to see the city come back to life. The trees are green, the gardens blooming and the cafés and restaurants doing a brisk business.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2085_News_1>When I was last here a pair of pigeons were in the beginning stages of building a nest in the eaves of the building across from my hotel room. Every day they would busily bring twigs and branches, weaving them together. Six weeks later they nestle upon their new home, oblivious to the war. That’s not to say there aren’t air raid sirens, and authorities constantly remind residents to remain vigilant.My stay in Lviv was very brief, only one night. Given that Ukrainian forces are currently pushing the Russians back, I departed for Kyiv, traveling by car through the countryside. The roads are very quiet, practically empty but for trucks hauling their loads toward the capital. Due to the war there’s a shortage of gasoline and diesel and the few petrol stations that have fuel have long lines – many waiting hours to fill their empty tanks. Even 150 miles from Kyiv there are checkpoints manned by camouflage-clad soldiers. They gave our vehicle a cursory glance before waving us onward. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2085_News_2>Approaching Kyiv, you begin to see the first signs of conflict. Not far from Irpin and Bucha, suburbs that bore the brunt of Russian artillery and fierce fighting, buildings lay in ruins, pockmarked with bullets. What remains of an industrial building is a testament to the bombing this area sustained, its steel beams twisted, and its walls charred from a direct hit. Nearby businesses and homes had all their windows blown out, but even here, where so many lost everything, there are signs of life. I saw several people working in their gardens, shovels in hand as they tended to their vegetables.McCONNELL MAKES SURPRISE TRIP TO MEET ZELENSKYY IN UKRAINEJust a few short miles later and Kyiv could be seen in the distance, an indication of just how close the Kremlin came to taking the capital. Most of the bridges were purposely blown up by the Ukrainians to stall any advance, but reconstruction is already underway. In the meantime, cars negotiate a rutted dirt path and drive over a temporary bridge to access the remaining highway into the city.Much like Lviv, once you’re in Kyiv life appears surprisingly normal with minimal signs of damage. Hedgehogs, welded steel barriers designed to stop tanks, sit unused on the sidewalk near Maidan in the central part of the city. Sandbags continue to line the entrance to the subway where residents who stayed sought shelter. Kyiv is slowly returning to a new normal, all eyes to the east where fighting continues, but with a growing belief that ultimately Ukraine will prevail.  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2085_News_3>At a small supermarket the shelves are well stocked with supplies, though fresh produce is limited. Despite the threat of war there was never any panic buying. People bought what they needed and nothing more, mindful of others. There was always a sense of unity, the understanding they were all in this together. During the 10 weeks I spent here at the beginning of the war I witnessed endless acts of kindness, people opening their homes to strangers who had no place else to go.

{"title": "As suspected COVID spread continues in North Korea, WHO frets over missing data", "body": "North Korea reported hundreds of thousands of new infections on Wednesday, but said that a million residents have already recovered from what is suspected to be COVID-19. The nation announced 232,880 new cases of fever and an additional six deaths, with at least 691,170 remaining in quarantine. While outside experts believe most of the fevers – 232,880 fever cases were announced on Wednesday – are from the coronavirus, North Korea lacks the testing capability to confirm all of them. The outbreak is also almost certainly larger than has been counted, because some people could be asymptomatic. While it remains uncertain how many cases were confirmed as COVID-19-related, it is also unclear how more than a million people recovered so quickly. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_3>This announcement comes just a week after acknowledging an outbreak, and imposing nationwide lockdowns.North Korea's population of 26 million are believed to be unvaccinated against the coronavirus, although South Korean officials said last week that they would offer to send vaccines and other emergency medical supplies to their northern neighbor. China has also offered to provide aid. North Korea has made no indication of whether they plan to accept the offer and have previously denied millions of doses of vaccine shots offered by the United Nations-backed COVAX distribution programSouth Korea’s government said it could not confirm media reports that North Korea flew planes to bring back medical equipment from China on Tuesday.Earlier this week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un criticized officials for their response to the health crisis. He said there was a failure to deliver medicine supplies to pharmacies on time because of their \"irresponsible\" work attitude and lackluster organization, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The ruling party, Politburo, had sent an emergency order to immediately distribute state medicine supplies and for pharmacies to remain open for 24 hours a day. Kim, however, said these measures were not being implemented properly and KCNA said he ordered his military's medical units to start stabilizing the medicine supply in Pyongyang.The World Health Organization's (WHO) leader said Tuesday that the country has not responded to its request for more information about coronavirus there. \"WHO is deeply concerned at the risk of further spread in (North Korea),\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/suspected-covid-spread-north-korea-who-missing-data", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Employees of Songyo Knitwear Factory wearing face masks work to produce knitted goods in Songyo district in Pyongyang, North Korea, Wednesday, May 18, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/NoKo-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this photo provided by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center, attends a meeting of ruling party Workers' Labor Party of Korea in Pyongyang, North Korea Tuesday, May 17, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/NoKo-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this photo provided by the North Korean government, a worker in protective gear stands on an empty sidewalk in Pyongyang, North Korea Tuesday, May 17, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/NoKo-4.jpg"}, {"caption": "This photo provided by the North Korean government shows deserted street in Pyongyang, North Korea Tuesday, May 17, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2101_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/NoKo-3.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Florida-based dog rescue group heads to Europe to save Ukraine pets displaced during Russian invasion", "body": "The South Florida-based Big Dog Ranch Rescue packed up and went to Eastern Europe to help displaced dogs from war-torn Ukraine find safe, loving homes as their owners were forced to flee or killed by the ongoing Russian invasion. \"We just felt for these dogs, we felt for what was going… when you're being bombed and your house is in rubble, sometimes you just you've got to get yourself and your kids out. Sometimes you just don't have the means to be able to take your pets with you,\" Big Dog Ranch Rescue founder and CEO Lauree Simmons told Fox News Digital via Zoom from a shelter in Poznan, Poland, that is being used to house many of the displaced canines. The dogs were separated from their owners amid the war started by Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three months ago. Simmons’ group will attempt to reunite them with their owners, and will find homes for the ones who are now without owners. \"Many of these people are very, very compassionate, and they care about their animals,\" Simmons said. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_0>Big Dog Ranch Rescue opened, and will operate, the shelter in Poland that is expected to be needed for at least four to six months. Big Dog Ranch Rescue has been saving distressed dogs since Simmons founded the group in 2008, and she has helped reunite pets with owners after natural disasters, works with veterans to prepare rescue dogs to become service dogs and pairs older pets with seniors who need companionship. The group celebrated saving over 50,000 dogs earlier this year and has emerged as a global voice for animal rights. Along the way, Simmons has been targeted by the liberal media for holding events at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, but she doesn’t think politics should have any impact on whether these dogs are cast aside.  \"Animals bring all walks of life [together] and whether you’re conservative or liberal or Democrat or Republican, it really doesn't matter right now,\" she said. \"What matters is helping these people that have lost everything and are running for their life and helping these poor animals that are left behind.\"Simmons said the number of dogs left homeless by Russia’s invasion is \"more than you can count,\" and she estimated the total could reach the \"hundreds of thousands.\" Big Dog Ranch Rescue specifically identified about 300 displaced dogs in one specific \"little town\" of the war-torn nation. She has seen a variety of breeds and sizes, ranging from purebred shepherd puppies to mixes of all types. \"Many, many animals were being left behind,\" Simmons said. \"Big Dog Ranch Rescue was used to going in to helping with hurricane, flood disasters. This was a little more difficult because it's the other side of the world and we don't speak the language, but seeing the pictures of the dogs with their legs blown off and dogs out there trying to find water and food and ghost town areas where everybody is left and dogs with burns on their back, and we said we had to help. We had to go.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_1>On Sunday, the first truck carrying dogs from hard-hit areas of Ukraine such as Mariupol and Dnipro arrived at the shelter in Poland. The first 20 dogs to arrive at the shelter were part of a four-day journey inside a cramped van that included everything from car trouble, trouble getting fuel, paperwork and documentation issues. However, for the group of Ukrainian women who helped transport the dogs to safety, overcoming obstacles has become a daily routine since Russia invaded their country. \"One of the Ukrainian women that is here that we’re housing and is going to be working daily here at this shelter, helping to care for the dogs, has been living in a bomb shelter for over 30 days with her dogs and people would be in the bomb shelter and they'd have pets and they'd leave without them. So she ended up with multiple dogs to care for that weren't even her own,\" Simmons said.\"It was daily, more dogs being abandoned in that area that had no way to find food, find water, find shelter. One of the dogs that was brought to her in the bomb shelter had a bomb hit very close by and the dog was flown several feet and has constant shaking and a brain injury from it,\" she continued. \"He's recuperating, it’s only a four-month-old puppy, but he'll have permanent damage from that.\"Other dogs have been dehydrated and Simmons said they’re \"all very thin,\" and many need life-saving fluids and treatment. Big Dog Ranch Rescue had hired a full-time veterinarian to care for them, stocked the Polish shelter with scales, medicine and everything else the dogs need to survive and received a food donation from Royal Canin. Next, she will head to Romania to help another shelter that has received an influx of pets as Ukrainians fight for their lives. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_2>The Ukrainian dogs won’t be available for adoption for several months, as they need to be quarantined and deemed 100 percent healthy before going anywhere. Many of them will likely wind up at Big Dog Ranch Rescue and Americans who want to help the cause can simply adopt one of the pets Simmons and her team have already saved. \"We do have 702 dogs that are ready for adoption, already healthy, at our facility right now,\" Simmons said. \"Clearing space at our rescue allows us the space to save another life.\" Big Dog Ranch Rescue isn’t only helping animals, it is also hiring now-homeless Ukrainians to work with the dogs. \"By giving them housing and by giving them a job, and a purpose, for something they love, which is animals, and helping them get back on their feet is almost as rewarding as saving the animals,\" Simmons said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_3>Big Dog Ranch Rescue has also partnered with Planting Peace, a global nonprofit that focuses on humanitarian and environmental initiatives. Simmons thinks it’s important for Americans to know that it’s extremely difficult for Ukrainians to even reach the border safely. She’s already heard tragic tales of devastation and chaos from people impacted by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. \"The horror stories of people that have lost loved ones and family members and their homes are in rubble and their lives are destroyed because of one very cruel, selfish man,\" she said. \"It’s sad to see so many heartaches, not only for the animals, but for the people of Ukraine.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_4>When the first truck carrying displaced Ukrainian dogs arrived in Poland on Sunday night, it didn’t take Simmons long to know she made the right decision to fly halfway across the globe and help. \"Just to see that change from when they first got out of that van to now and playing and it's just so rewarding,\" Simmons said. \"I think dogs know when they're rescued and they're in a safe place and they're getting loving arms around them and food and shelter they know.\" Big Dog Ranch Rescue is accepting donations and has a mission to \"save 5,000 dogs every year, to heal and place them with loving families and to educate people about the proper care for dogs and the importance of spaying and neutering,\" according to the organization’s website.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//media/big-dog-ranch-rescue-ukraine", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Big Dog Ranch Rescue founder and president Lauree Simmons in South Florida.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Lauree-Pic.jpg"}, {"caption": "Big Dog Ranch Rescue founder and CEO Lauree Simmons and Ukrainian refugees are working together to save dogs who have been separated from their owners during the Russian invasion.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_4189.jpg"}, {"caption": "A Big Dog Ranch Rescue staffer embraces a dog who was displaced during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_4142.jpg"}, {"caption": "The first batch of dogs saved by Big Dog Ranch Rescue arrived in Poland on Sunday.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_4122.jpg"}, {"caption": "A group of Ukrainian women are working with the South Florida-based Big Dog Ranch to save displaced pets.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2126_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_2740.jpg"}]}

He says he personally warned them in January this would happen if Russian troops crossed into Ukraine.Last November, 20% of all Finns wanted to join NATO; now, nearly 80% want to join, according to recent polls, a dramatic shift in public sentiment after decades of neutrality after World War II.\"I think the major change of course was the Russian attack, because the popular mood started to change rapidly after that,\" Hautala said.\"The attack on Ukraine, which was totally illegal. It was unprovoked. I think it shocked the Finns in a profound way because they saw that their neighbor is really capable of such an action.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2133_News_7>Today as the Swedish Parliament debated whether to join NATO, the shift in tone from Vladimir Putin was as surprising as the decision of Finland and Sweden to apply to join NATO after decades of neutrality in the wake of Russia's invasion. Putin said unless NATO built bases in Sweden and Finland and put permanent troops there, Russia would not have a problem with Finland and Sweden joining NATO.\"As far as expansion - new members Finland and Sweden included - Russia - I would like to remind you, dear colleagues - doesn't have any problem with those countries,\" Putin said to six former Soviet States marking the 30th Anniversary of the Collective Security Treaty Organization. \"Therefore, there is not an immediate threat to Russia with the inclusion of those countries. But the expansion of military infrastructure over that territory will obviously call for our response.\" Some Russian spokesmen have threatened to deploy nuclear weapons to Finland’s border if Finland joins NATO. Today Putin responded with a more subdued and nuanced warning.Finland's President called Putin Saturday to tell him that his country planned to join NATO after decades of neutrality.\"In my opinion, the NATO membership is an act of peace, it's about war never returning to Finland,\" Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told Parliament.Sweden’s Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told Parliament:\"Should Sweden be the only country in the Baltic Sea region that was not a member of NATO, we would be in a very vulnerable position, we can't rule out that Russia would then increase pressure on Sweden.\" Finland’s Ambassador to the U.S. said of Russia’s response: \"They have always said that they would react in some way. Most likely they will place more military resources close to the Finnish border.\"\"Nuclear weapons,\" Fox News asked?\"I don't see that as a kind of a major issue here,\" Hautala said. \"Finland has a large number of nuclear bunkers. Are you preparing those bunkers,\" I ask.\"They have been built and prepared and they stay ready.\" Unlike most pending applications to NATO, the ambassador says Finland would not be a drain financially to the alliance.\"We fulfill all the criteria that you can imagine. We are a well established democracy. We are among the best rule of law countries. We are the least corrupted country in the world,\" Hautala said. \"We have never dismantled our armed services. Finland brings more resources, they will bring added value to the alliance. We have a lot a lot of military capabilities in relation to our size.\"Finland is already spending more than 2 percent of its GDP on defense, unlike many NATO members.We have a large army. We have a modern Air Force. I think one of the best in Europe. We have a huge artillery. I think it can be even the biggest one after Russia. It's really, it's really strong. 76% of our population is ready to defend our country militarily, regardless of the outcome.\"Some of the ambassador's most sensitive, and classified discussions with other diplomats and American officials take place in his sauna in northwest Washington, D.C., where frank discussions can be had and there is no place to hide listening devices. This is where he makes his opponents sweat, he joked as he showed Fox News his sauna. At the entrance is a photograph of the father of modern Finland General Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. Hautala spent his formative years as a young diplomat in Ukraine - he is fluent in Russian and Ukrainian. \"I basically fell in love with the place.\" He recalls a particular evening in early 2000 when one Friday evening at a restaurant on a main street in Kyiv, he was packed into a restaurant with other Ukrainians. \"Suddenly, there was a silence. Total silence. A man came in with the Russian Ministry of Interior camouflage uniform. So he had a Russian flag and a Russian emblem. I noticed the people went silent. And everybody was looking at that guy.\" Hautala added he took a mental note: \"People started to stare. And I sort of made a mental note that this country is developing kind of an identity a sense of its own.\"The Finnish ambassador grew up with the stories of his grandfather, a Finnish farmer, deployed to the trenches on the border with Russia fighting the Russian invasion of Finland in 1939 at the start of World War II during what became known as the Winter War. It was 45 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The Finns pushed the Russians back and the Russians signed a ceasefire after three months.\"They were farmers, just ordinary people. They were very patriotic,\" Hautala said. \"One of the myths in Russia about Finland is that we used to have snipers in trees.\" The Ambassador still has his grandfather's diary describing how the Finnish citizens armed to the teeth waited in the forests to attack the invading Russian troops. \"Finland was 4 million; Soviet Union was almost 200 million,\" Hautala said. \"So the difference was huge. But I think what basically saved us was that the fact that we had more motivation like we see now in Ukraine.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/neutral-nato-why-finland-wants-join-nato-exclusive-interview-finlands-ambassador", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2133_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "On the right is the Ambassador's grandmother, Laura Hautala, a member of Lotta Svärd, voluntary auxiliary paramilitary organization for women.

{"title": "China lags in Taiwan invasion ambition and US needs to take advantage, expert says", "body": "The U.S. needs to start thinking more globally if it hopes to limit China's ambitions as President Xi Jinping sets a timeline that would see his military capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, experts told Fox News Digital.U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley this week highlighted comments from Chinese President Xi Jinping in which he laid out a timeline to achieve the capability — not intent — to invade Taiwan by 2027. The comments first surfaced in a speech Xi gave to the People’s Liberation Army in 2021, during which he challenged his army to accelerate its modernization. Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby on Friday addressed the 2027 timeline, painting a broad-strokes picture in which China needed to improve its offensive, power projection, access denial and other capabilities. \"They're trying to accumulate standoff capabilities to prevent other militaries, including the United States, from physical access to whatever territorial claims they might make,\" Kirby said. \"So it's a combination of these kinds of capabilities that I think we're watching both offensive and access denial capabilities.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_3>Developing those capabilities does not guarantee China could carry out that invasion; Kirby pointed to economic challenges as a potential pitfall, saying that China is \"not immune to the international economy,\" which can have an effect on Beijing’s ability to build defense capabilities. The most important shortcoming China faces compared to the U.S. includes its ability to defend against an amphibious force, as well as the ability to cut off support from Taiwan’s allies, such as cutting off shipping lanes and other methods of supply, according to James Anderson, acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under President Trump. \"One is to have a really strong amphibious capability,\" Anderson told Fox News Digital. \"They need more amphibious platforms — large amphibious ships — and they're building those … having these large amphibious warships strengthens their capacity to invade the island or rather increases the capability of success.\"That involves missiles and mines and aircraft to basically prevent U.S. warships from getting close to the island of Taiwan and preventing them from assisting in Taiwan's defense for preventing them in any type of resupply efforts,\" Anderson added. But Anderson believes that the more critical element in China’s calculus will be the level of assistance to Taiwan from the U.S. and its allies – an element that would factor heavily in China's decision to hit that target.\"It's in that context that PRC sea denial capabilities become a really important variable, and that is to say now to what extent could the PRC anticipate being able to hold off efforts by the United States Navy and other partners efforts to assist Taiwan,\" Anderson explained. \"I think the PRC roughly has that capability to forcibly retake the island sooner than 2027, depending on certain scenarios,\" he added. \"For example, if the United States is seriously distracted by another conflict in the world … it would be less capable and less likely to assist Taiwan.\" Matt McInnis from the Institute for the Study of War agreed that the U.S. will need to \"make choices and has to prioritize\" its international initiatives but has to \"think globally\" if it wants to combat China’s growing capabilities. \"You hear some of this in recent comments from U.S. military leaders about how to think about China and Russia as an interrelated problem,\" McInnis said. \"The question of how do you factor in the Middle East or South Asia or other key places … certainly from a resource perspective, the U.S. has made some pretty significant choices.\" Those choices include accelerating the military drawdown and withdrawal from Afghanistan and heavy investment in Ukraine’s military capabilities in the buildup to and throughout Russia’s invasion earlier this year. The lack of engagement in the Middle East has worried longtime U.S. allies in the region, especially in light of the Biden administration’s intent to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, which has the potential to destabilize the region and lead to heightened nuclear weapons proliferation. At the same time, China has increased investment in the region, signing contracts with Iraq and other countries to provide construction material and help improve local infrastructure. McInnis, who served as a member of policy planning at the State Department, also explained how China has invested in Latin America, including Panama and Mexico. \"China is expanding its ability to operate,\" McInnis said. \"And part of that is because they understand that any potential conflict with the United States is going to go on for a while … it’s going to be important to disrupt U.S. capabilities to supply a fight as well as allies in Europe and potentially India and other places too.\" Kirby noted in his comments Friday to reporters that the U.S. military budget has \"an awful lot,\" including record investment in science and technology research \"to try to make sure that we too have the capabilities to meet those commitments.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/former-defense-official-heres-where-china-lags-in-taiwan-invasion-ambition", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Minister Joseph Wu speaks during an interview in Taipei, Taiwan, Nov. 6, 2019.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/Joseph-Wu.jpg"}, {"caption": "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian invites questions during a press conference at the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, China, Nov. 23, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/ZhaoLijian.jpg"}, {"caption": "Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech via video link to the opening ceremony of the Bo'ao Forum For Asia in Bo'ao in southern China's Hainan Province April 21, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Xi-Jinping-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Special operation soldiers of the Chinese naval fleet for escort mission wave farewell on the deck at a port in Zhoushan, east China's Zhejiang Province, April 28, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2280_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/12/Chinese-navy-2.jpg"}]}

She’s expected to have a hearing in Russia on May 19.Richardson’s involvement came at the same time the U.S. State Department said in a statement to Fox News Digital that Griner has been reclassified as being \"wrongfully detained.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_0>\"The welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad is among the highest priorities of the U.S government,\" a State Department spokesperson said. \"The Department of State has determined that the Russian Federation has wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittney Griner.\"With this determination, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens will lead the interagency team for securing Brittney Griner’s release.\"Griner’s Lindsay Kagawa Colas also released a statement on the WNBA star’s detention on Tuesday.\"Brittney has been detained for 75 days and our expectation is that the White House do whatever is necessary to bring her home,\" the statement to Fox News Digital read.Richardson, who served as an ambassador in the Clinton administration, also had a helping hand in getting Americans out of North Korea and Burma after he left his post.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_1>Richardson helped the State Department secure the release of Evan Hunziker, who was the first American citizen to be arrested in North Korea on espionage charges since the end of the Korean War. Hunziker was spent three months in 1996 in custody before U.S. officials secured his release.In 2013, Richardson, led a \"humanitarian\" mission to North Korea to try and talk to Pyongyang about the release of Kenneth Bae, who was accused of trying to help topple the government. Richardson and others failed to get him released. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison before he was released in 2014.Ohio Gov. John Kasich asked Richardson for his help in trying to get Otto Warmbier released from North Korean custody, who was detained on a visit in 2016. Warmbier was released in 2017 in a vegetative state.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_2>In 2021, Richardson negotiated with the military junta to release journalist Danny Fenster who was sentenced to 11 years in prison over alleged incitement and violations of laws on immigration and unlawful assembly.-<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_3>Aron Solomon, chief legal analyst for Esquire Digital, talked to Fox News Digital about the latest word from the State Department about Griner’s reclassification. He said Griner is as much of a political prisoner as Trevor Reed was and as Paul Whelan is.Solomon said there was no way Griner didn’t know the laws about bringing in hashish oil into Russia having played in the country for seven years before her arrest.\"It made no sense to me since day one that she was re-entering Russia with drugs that could land her in prison,\" Solomon said.He added Richardson has \"one great skill.\"\"Everybody knows he’s a hostage negotiator. The State Department said, well, she’s not a hostage. They only reclassified her status to wrongfully detained. We’re not saying that she’s a hostage. Of course, she’s a hostage. Where we are right now is Russia and the United States have been talking for weeks trying to come up with a good trade for Brittney Griner,\" he said.\"My opinion, Russia probably said, you know what? How about we relax some of the economic sanctions. For example, countries like Germany can pay for Russia oil and they don’t have to use rubles. And the United States was probably like we’re not giving that for Brittney Griner. It’s too much of a trade. …\"He added: \"This is totally a political prisoner, a political detainee situation at this point. And she could be there for another two weeks, two months to two years depending on when the Russian and American governments find a good swap.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_4>Solomon said he didn’t think the new developments would speed up Griner’s release.\"I don’t think anything that has happened recently helped speed up her release date because I don’t think it’s in Russia’s benefit until they could maximize her value. The U.S. government has supposedly been telling her family, the WNBA, her agent, everybody to keep quiet and now everybody’s OK to talk about. I’ve been saying people should’ve been talking about it all along,\" he told Fox News Digital.\"The reason being is I want you to imagine if it wasn’t Brittney Griner who was taken into custody but the person I always like to use is Kyrie Irving. There’d be free Kyrie vigils. Kyrie Irving would be on every single paper every day. They’d be counting down the dates of his detention – because it’s Kyrie Irving. It’s Britney Griner, it’s a woman’s basketball player. I think it actually benefits the United States and Russia for people to keep talking about her because I’m sure Russia wants people to keep talking about her because it increases her value as somebody who’s in demand but it also keeps her in the public spotlight and puts pressure on the U.S. government to do something as they did in appointing a hostage negotiator.\"Solomon keyed in on what Richardson could bring to the table as an expert in this field.\"I think an experience hostage negotiator who understands Russia, who understands how their diplomatic channels work, who has experience like he does in the United Nations, can be super, super valuable,\" he said. \"Him being the negotiator doesn’t mean she’s going to be released next week. It could, but it could be years. Paul Whelan has been in custody since 2018. … Who knows how long this is going to take. I don’t think Richardson’s involvement itself means this thing is close to over.\"The WNBA announced measures it would take this season to pay tribute to Griner while she’s held in Russia. Starting Friday, Griner’s initials and jersey number (42) will be featured along the sideline of all 12 WNBA courts.\"As we begin the 2022 season, we are keeping Brittney at the forefront of what we do through the game of basketball and in the community,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a news release. \"We continue to work on bringing Brittney home and are appreciative of the support the community has shown BG and her family during this extraordinarily challenging time.\"Jim Pitman, the Mercury’s executive vice president and GM, added: \"In conjunction with the league, the other 11 teams, and those closest to BG, we will work to keep her top-of-mind as we tip the 2022 season. While we await her return, our main concern remains for her safety and well-being. Our fans will miss her impact on the court and in our community, and this gesture of including her initials on every court and our BG’s Heart and Sole Shoe Drive activation in every market are for them and for her.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/brittney-griner-russia-detention-bill-richardson-involvement-wnba", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Brittney Griner of USA during the Women's Semifinal Basketball game between United States and Serbia on day fourteen of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Saitama Super Arena on August 6, 2021 in Saitama, Japan", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Brittney-Griner12.jpg"}, {"caption": "FILE – In this Feb. 29, 2016, file photo, American student Otto Warmbier speaks as Warmbier is presented to reporters in Pyongyang, North Korea.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/972996830a4c4841ae1b9f415b73e5d7.jpg"}, {"caption": "American journalist Danny Fenster, who was released from prison on Monday after negotiations between former U.S. diplomat Bill Richardson and the ruling military junta in Myanmar, speaks to the media at JFK International Airport in New York, U.S. November 16, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/Danny-Fenster.jpg"}, {"caption": "Former U.S. diplomat Bill Richardson American speaks during a news conference after the release of journalist Danny Fenster, who was released from prison on Monday after negotiations between Richardson and the ruling military junta in Myanmar, after Fenster's arrival at JFK International airport in New York, U.S., November 16, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/Bill-Richardson.jpg"}, {"caption": "Bill Richardson, former Governor of New Mexico, in an interview on January 13, 2015.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2412_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/Bill-Richardson2.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Push to arm Ukraine putting strain on US weapons stockpile", "body": "The planes take off almost daily from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware — hulking C-17s loaded up with Javelins, Stingers, howitzers and other material being hustled to Eastern Europe to resupply Ukraine’s military in its fight against Russia.The game-changing impact of those arms is exactly what President Joe Biden hopes to spotlight as he visits a Lockheed Martin plant in Alabama on Tuesday that builds the portable Javelin anti-tank weapons that have played a crucial role in Ukraine.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News_0>But Biden’s visit is also drawing attention to a growing concern as the war drags on: Can the U.S. sustain the cadence of shipping vast amounts of arms to Ukraine while maintaining the healthy stockpile it may need if a new conflict erupts with North Korea, Iran or elsewhere?The U.S. already has provided about 7,000 Javelins, including some that were delivered during the Trump administration, about one-third of its stockpile, to Ukraine, according to an analysis by Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies international security program. The Biden administration says it has committed to sending about 5,500 to Ukraine since the Russian invasion more than two months ago.Analysts also estimate that the United States has sent about one-quarter of its stockpile of shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to Ukraine. Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told investors last week during a quarterly call that his company, which makes the weapons system, wouldn’t be able to ramp up production until next year due to parts shortages.\"Could this be a problem? The short answer is, ‘Probably, yes,'\" said Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and former government specialist on Pentagon budget strategy, war funding and procurement.He said that Stingers and Javelins were where \"we’re seeing the most significant inventory issues,\" and production of both weapons systems has been limited in recent years.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News_2>The Russian invasion offers the U.S. and European defense industry a big opportunity to bolster profits as lawmakers from Washington to Warsaw are primed to increase defense spending in response to Russian aggression. Defense contractors, however, face the same supply chain and labor shortage challenges that other manufacturers are facing, along with some others that are specific to the industry.Military spending by the U.S. and around the world was rising even before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion. Biden’s proposed 2023 budget sought $773 billion for the Pentagon, an annual increase of about 4%.Globally, total military spending rose 0.7% to more than $2 trillion for the first time in 2021, according to an April report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Russia ranked fifth, as its spending on weapons increased ahead of its invasion of Ukraine.The war will mean increased sales for some defense contractors, including Raytheon, which makes the Stinger missiles Ukrainian troops have used to knock out Russian aircraft. The company is also part of a joint venture with Lockheed Martin that makes the Javelins.Biden will visit Lockheed Martin's facility in Troy, Ala., which has the capacity to manufacture about 2,100 Javelins per year. The trip comes as he presses Congress to quickly approve his request for an additional $33 billion in security and economic assistance for Kyiv, Western allies and restocking weapons the U.S. has sent to those countries.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday he hoped quick bipartisan agreement on the security package could be reached so the Senate could begin considering it \"as early as next week.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News_3>The president is expected to use his remarks to highlight the importance of the Javelins and other U.S. weaponry in helping Ukraine's military put up a vigorous fight as he makes the case to keep security and economic assistance flowing.A White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity, said the Pentagon is working with defense contractors \"to evaluate the health of weapons systems’ production lines and examine bottlenecks in every component and step of the manufacturing process.\" The administration is also considering a range of options, if needed, to boost production of both Javelins and Stingers, the official said.Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Monday that America’s military readiness is not dependent on one system, such as the Javelin. He said that every time the Pentagon develops a package of weapons to send to Ukraine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the department assesses the broader impact.\"It’s not about counting say Javelins and being able to say that when you reach a certain level then all your readiness is gone,\" Kirby said. \"The Javelin is an anti-armor capability, so we judge it all as a conglomerate of what’s our ability to meet this particular mission set, realizing that a Javelin isn’t the only capability you have against armor.\"Cancian, the former government specialist on defense budget strategy, said the fact that Stingers and Javelins were not included in the most recent tranche of weapons the Biden administration announced it was sending to Ukraine could be a sign that Pentagon officials are mindful about inventory as they conduct contingency planning for other possible conflicts.\"There’s no question that whatever war plan they're looking at there is risk associated with the depleting levels of Stingers and Javelins, and I’m sure that they’re having that discussion at the Pentagon,\" he said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News_4>The U.S. military effort to move weaponry to Eastern Europe for Ukraine’s fight has been Herculean. From Dover Air Base in Delaware, U.S. airmen have carried out nearly 70 missions to deliver some 7 million pounds of Javelins, Stingers, 155mm howitzers, helmets and other essentials to Eastern Europe since February. Col. Matt Husemann, commander of the 436th Airlift Wing, described the mission as a \"whole of government approach that’s delivering hope.\"\"It is awesome,\" said Husemann, after providing AP with a recent tour of the airlift operation.The lightweight but lethal Javelin has helped the Ukrainians inflict major damage on Russia's larger and better-equipped military. As a result, the weapon has gained almost mythic regard, celebrated with a Javelin song and images of Mary Magdalene carrying a Javelin becoming a meme in Ukraine.Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet said in a recent CNBC interview that demand for the Javelin and other weapon systems would increase broadly over time because of the Russian invasion. He said the company was working \"to get our supply chain ramped up.\"\"We have the ability to meet current production demands, are investing in increased capacity and are exploring ways to further increase production as needed,\" Lockheed Martin said in a statement.Pentagon officials recently sat down with some of the leading defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman to discuss efforts to ramp up production.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News_5>The big defense contractors face some serious challenges.Raytheon, for example, can’t simply crank out Stingers to replace the 1,400 that the U.S. sent to Ukraine. Hayes, the Raytheon CEO, said in a recent conference call with analysts that the company has only limited supplies of components to make the missile. Only one undisclosed country has been buying them in recent years, and the Pentagon hasn’t bought any new ones in nearly 20 years.Sanctions further complicate the picture. Companies must find new sources of important raw materials such as titanium, a crucial component in aerospace manufacturing that is produced in Russia.Concerns about the Stinger stockpile have been raised by House Armed Services Committee chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., and the top Republican on the committee, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama. The two in March wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, describing the stockpile issue as one of \"urgency.\"Rogers said he remains concerned that the matter hasn't been properly addressed.\"I’ve been asking the DoD for almost two months for a plan to replenish our Stinger stockpile as well as our Javelin launch units,\" Rogers said. \"I worry that without a readily available replacement or fully active production lines, we could leave Ukraine and our NATO allies in a vulnerable position.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//politics/push-arm-ukraine-putting-strain-us-weapons-stockpile", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "U.S. Air Force Airman Megan Konsmo, from Tacoma, Wash., checks pallets of equipment ultimately bound for Ukraine in the Super Port of the 436th Aerial Port Squadron, Friday, April 29, 2022, at Dover Air Force Base, Del.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2440_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/AP22119787822364.jpg"}, {"caption": "U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt.

{"title": "Ukraine war: Arizona sends charity estimated $400,000 worth of tactical, defensive supplies", "body": "A Ukrainian charity received a whopping donation of roughly $400,000-worth of tactical and defensive gear from Arizona as part of an effort to alleviate supply shortages in the war against Russia. Ihor Koval, 58, was born in Ukraine and served in the Soviet Army prior to its dissolution in 1992. He later moved to America and raised a family, but he returned when conflict erupted in Donetsk in 2014 to help supply troops on the front lines through his charity, Evil Cannot Enter Heaven. The Koval family established an American extension of the charity, which can accept donations through its website or via texting UKRAINE to 56512 or at 1-866-447-6645.Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, organized the collection and shipment of surplus vests and armor to Ukraine through Ihor Koval’s charity, amassing over 9,000 pounds – roughly 17 palettes – of equipment.\"We received a letter from the Arizona governor, directly to us, with pictures of them,\" Roman Koval, Ihor’s son, told Fox News Digital. Roman Koval said the charity received donations of gear from the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs (DEMA); Arizona Department of Public Safety; the Mesa, Sedona and Phoenix police departments; a number of sheriffs’ departments; and several Native American reservations, including the Navajo. \"We’ve also been in contact with several other state DEMAs, which is a work in progress,\" Roman Koval told Fox. \"We’ve had the opportunity to connect with people who are sending anything from $2000 to $5000 in equipment or funds.\" He also mentioned people giving \"whatever they can.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_3>\"The DEMA, when they organized it, they sent over 900 bulletproof vests, helmets and a ton of tactical equipment, meaning non-lethal aid like boots and clothing,\" he added. He estimated that the total the charity raised on its own amounted to $75,000, but the sizable Arizona donations have been incredible. Ihor Koval, who remains in Lviv, Ukraine to coordinate the distribution of gear to the front lines, said his family has been buying up what they can with the donations while he buys more tactical gear – including night vision and thermal vision goggles, Kevlar vests and thermal underpants. He has brushed up against some violence during his deliveries, including a near-miss with the explosion at the train station in Kramatorsk. \"On the way back, when I was returning … about a quarter-mile away, we were held up about three minutes at the post, because one of the soldiers wanted to bring something back to Lviv for him, and we heard this explosion,\" Ihor Koval said. \"As we found out later, that was just around the corner at the railroad station.\" The list of the required equipment has evolved, with troops needing knee pads and body armor, but also generators, phones, pants and general uniforms and clothing. \"Yesterday in Poland I bought thermal underwear, boots, socks…mostly everything is going for optics, binoculars, that sort of thing,\" he said. The fighting in Ukraine has shifted eastward after Russia failed to take Kyiv following a month-long siege, meaning the fighting will continue in the very region that first prompted Ihor Koval to start his charity and join the war effort. \"It is exactly in the same villages I was going to in 2014 – same area, and they’re holding the line very well,\" he said, adding that the Ukrainians are not \"giving up one bit.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/ukraine-war-arizona-charity-tactical-defensive-supplies", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Ihor Koval with the palettes of donated tactical and defensive equipment from Arizona.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/image_from_ios-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ihor Koval with two Ukrainian soldiers helping to deliver gear to the front lines in Eastern Ukraine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/image_from_ios-3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Nodar Karalashvili, a member of the Ukrainian Army who helped deliver donated gear to the Donetsk region.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/image_from_ios.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ihor Koval with Nodar Karalashvili, a member of the Ukrainian Army who helped deliver donated gear to the Donetsk region.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2668_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/image_from_ios-2.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Reporter's Notebook: Sitting on the tarmac", "body": "Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., began a Zoom call with reporters this week with a travelogue.\"I just returned from an Intelligence Committee congressional delegation trip with three other members,\" said Crow. \"We visited multiple locations within Poland, Slovakia and Romania.\"Over the past couple of weeks, who hasn’t?The two-week Easter/Passover/Ramadan recess on Capitol Hill – coupled with an easing of the pandemic restrictions – prompted lawmakers to travel more overseas this month than they have since late 2019. These are official \"congressional delegation\" trips, known as \"CODELs.\" Congressional leaders, senior members and committee chairs in both the House and Senate lead members on these trips abroad.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2734_News_0>The trips are useful for fact-finding, gathering information and also escaping the \"groupthink\" that sometimes bedevils those who toil inside the Beltway. But do the jaunts actually fix problems or prompt policy changes?Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., represents part of Fort Campbell, which sits astride the southern Kentucky/northern Tennessee border. Like Crow, Green also just returned from a trip to the Ukrainian border. The congressman says he met with a French battalion commander who is meeting with a U.S. Stryker Brigade combat team in Poland under the NATO aegis. \"I make these trips and say goodbye to my wife so that the military men and women in my community don’t have to kiss their spouses goodbye and go to war,\" said Green.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2734_News_1>In addition, Green met with U.S. military personnel in Poland.\"They were short of washing machines,\" said Green, who promptly messaged the Pentagon for more. \"That’s just one of the unspoken or unseen things.\"Taxpayers used to howl at lawmakers taking overseas \"official\" trips to exotic locations. The emphasis was once on the beach and pool – with a symposium or two sprinkled in to justify the affair. But that’s no longer the case.\"Congressional travel has changed dramatically in the last 30 or 40 years, in large part, because of media scrutiny that was brought on to the members of Congress who were frankly getting vacations on the taxpayer dollars,\" said Brad Fitch of the Congressional Management Foundation.Fitch notes that lawmakers are worried about criticism that they’re not really working. Or worse yet, the  that lawmakers aren’t working when they go on these trips.Former CIA officer and Senate aide Ron Marks helped coordinate a number of CODELs for late Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Marks says there was one senator who demanded a certain amount of beach and leisure time on trips of yore.\"There were squash games scheduled during all of this,\" said Marks of one particular senator. But Marks says there’s now pressure to keep an intense business program.\"You schedule from 8 in the morning until 10 at night. You don’t really have a chance to think,\" said Marks. In fact, some lawmakers don’t even like to go on CODELs led by certain congressional leaders because the days are so grueling.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2734_News_2>\"No sleeping, even on the plane,\" said one source. \"I’ve been to a couple of these myself where they had better be pouring coffee at 3 or 4 in the afternoon,\" said Fitch. \"There’s a tedium to some of these trips that can be a little bit challenging.\"But advocates of congressional travel say lawmakers can only ingest so much information from hearings or leafing through briefing dossiers.\"Sometimes just having somebody sitting there, smelling the air, hearing what’s going on on the ground, even if you’re just riding through there, give them far greater understanding than anything they’re going to get reading a newspaper or reading a briefing in Washington,\" said Marks. \"I would rather have them going out there and at least kicking the tires a little bit than sitting back and sort of making it up like an analyst.\"But Marks concedes some lawmakers do take congressional trips specifically for glorified photo-ops. To see and be seen. To make a point about a given political issue. Or maybe, even make the administration of the opposing party look bad.\"I know there are political games that get played here,\" said Marks. \"I understand the 1,001 reasons why people show up in different places. Politicians want to get re-elected.\"This is why lots of Republicans have flocked to the southern border over the past two weeks. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., heads to Eagle Pass, Texas, in the coming days to highlight the crisis. The Biden administration is under fire from GOPers – and members of its own party – for ending Title 42, the pandemic era policy that curbed migration. There’s concern that illegal immigration could explode at the border once the administration formally rescinds Title 42 in late May. Republicans want to make sure the public knows who is responsible. That’s why GOPers are revved up to question Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at a hearing next week.Meanwhile, vulnerable Democrats facing competitive re-election bids are also putting distance between themselves and the administration’s policy, and also drawing attention to the border. It’s good policy for those Democrats to use President Biden as a foil.Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC). That’s the formal panel charged with electing Democrats to the Senate. Peters also chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. And, Peters is now part of a growing list of Senate Democrats who are bucking their party on Title 42. Peters’ decision gives other Democrats air cover to challenge the administration on the policy – and use their own president as a foil.So expect a lot more lawmakers, from both parties, to head to the border.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2734_News_3>\"In some of these cases, members of Congress are using (CODELs) to showcase an issue,\" said Fitch. \"There’s no denying that some members of Congress feel there’s a symbolic value to going on a trip, whether it’s getting their picture taken with Border Patrol agents or getting their picture taken next to troops in Afghanistan or Iraq overseas.\"But do the trips find solutions to big policy fights?\"They’re never going to solve the problem,\" said Marks. \"If you’re talking about really solving problems, that gets down to people and hard bargaining across a table somewhere. Discussing budgets. Discussing laws. Discussing oversight.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2734_News_4>But long trips mean several things. Lots of time on airplanes. Lots of time on buses. Lots of time in hotel bars. The creation of the jet airplane made it hard for lawmakers to get to know one another in Washington. But the pandemic and the Capitol riot drove an even more stark wedge between the sides and poisoned the congressional well. Lawmakers not only couldn’t get to know one another as well because of the pandemic, but because of the riot, some had no interest in meeting members from the other side and vice versa.But, ironically the return of CODELs could help thaw frosty congressional relations in an almost intangible, unquantifiable way.\"Relationships are built if you’re on a long flight from Poland back to Washington, D.C., and you’re sitting next to a member of Congress from the other party. It may be an opportunity to build lasting relationships,\" said Fitch. \"I’ve seen legislative deals that were cut because of long congressional trips.\"\"Tribalism is tearing this country apart,\" said Green just back from Eastern Europe. \"So you’re just sitting there, getting to know someone across the aisle. You’re finding out about their children. You’re finding out about their college experience. That creates relationships inside the Congress that go way beyond just the issue at hand.\"So, the recent spate of travel may not end the war in Ukraine. It may not solve the border crisis.

{"title": "US Army using lessons from Ukraine war to aid own training", "body": "In the dusty California desert, U.S. Army trainers are already using lessons learned from Russia’s war against Ukraine as they prepare soldiers for future fights against a major adversary such as Russia or China.The role-players in this month’s exercise at the National Training Center speak Russian. The enemy force that controls the fictional town of Ujen is using a steady stream of social media posts to make false accusations against the American brigade preparing to attack.In the coming weeks, the planned training scenario for the next brigade coming in will focus on how to battle an enemy willing to destroy a city with rocket and missile fire in order to conquer it.If the images seem familiar, they are, playing out on televisions and websites worldwide right now as Russian forces pound Ukrainian cities with airstrikes, killing scores of civilians. The information war on social media has showcased impassioned nightly speeches by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Russian efforts to accuse Ukraine’s forces of faking mass killings in towns such as Bucha – massacres that the West blames on Moscow’s troops.\"I think right now the whole Army is really looking at what’s happening in Ukraine and trying to learn lessons,\" said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Those lessons, she said, range from Russia’s equipment and logistics troubles to communications and use of the internet.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2833_News_0>\"The Russia-Ukraine experience is a very powerful illustration for our Army of how important the information domain is going to be,\" said Wormuth, who spent two days at the training center in the Mojave Desert watching an Army brigade wage war against the fictional \"Denovian\" forces.\"We’ve been talking about that for about five years. But really seeing it and seeing the way Zelenskyy has been incredibly powerful. ... This is a world war that the actual world can see and watch in real time. \"At the center, the commander, Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor, and his staff have ripped pages out of the Russian playbook to ensure that U.S. soldiers are ready to fight and win against a sophisticated near-peer enemy.It’s a common tool. For example, his base and the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana both shifted to counterinsurgency training during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. And the military services have focused other training on how to fight in cold weather – mimicking conditions in Russia or North Korea. But these latest changes have happened quickly in the early months after Russia invaded Ukraine.About 4,500 soldiers from 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, are out in the vast desert training area at Fort Irwin, where they will spend two weeks fighting the NTC’s resident 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which acts as the enemy military. Soldiers from the regiment – known as Blackhorse – are arrayed in and around Ujen, which also includes role-players acting as the locals.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2833_News_1>As the sun was rising earlier this past week, Army Col. Ian Palmer, the brigade commander, stood on Crash Hill, on the outskirts of the town, preparing his soldiers to launch an attack. Lines of tanks spread out in the distance. Heavy winds the night before hampered his progress, so the attack was a bit behind.He said the exercise is using more drones by the friendly and enemy forces, both for surveillance and attacks. So his forces are trying to use camouflage and tuck into the terrain to stay out of sight. \"You know if you can be seen, you can be shot, wherever you are,\" he said.Down in the makeshift town, the opposition forces are confident they can hold off Palmer’s brigade despite the size difference. The Denovians only have about 1,350 forces, but they are throwing everything they have at the brigade, from jamming and other electronic warfare to insurgency attacks and propaganda.The role-players have their phones ready to film and post quickly to social media.The Denovian forces want to portray the unit in the worst possible light, said Taylor, and constantly twist the narrative on social media so Palmer’s troops realize they are in a battle for the truth.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2833_News_2>That’s a challenge, he said, because \"when I’ve got a bunch of casualties and I’m getting overrun on my left flank and my supply trains aren’t where they need to be and I can’t find the bulldozers, it’s hard to think about something that someone said about me on Twitter.\"The training goal, said Taylor, is teaching how to fuse all elements of combat power into a coordinated assault.\"Everyone can play an instrument, but it’s about making music – bringing it all together in a synchronized fashion. And what you saw today was the artillery was doing the artillery thing, the aviation was doing the aviation thing and the maneuver guys were doing the maneuver thing. But part of the delay in their assault on the town was they couldn’t synchronize those three,\" he said.Again, they can look to Ukraine to see how Russia failed to do that in the early weeks of the war. U.S. leaders repeatedly noted that, in Russia’s initial multipronged assault in Ukraine, commanders consistently failed to provide the airstrikes and support their ground troops needed to move into key cities such as Kyiv.That failure led to Russian troops bombing the cities from the outskirts, hitting hospitals, apartment buildings and other structures, and killing civilians.So when the next brigade arrives at the training center, Taylor said it will face an enemy on board with doing just that.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2833_News_3>\"We will be very focused on how to fight against an adversary that is willing to destroy infrastructure because that’s how we think our adversaries will fight,\" Taylor said. \"We’ve got to be prepared for urban combat where we have an adversary that is indiscriminately firing artillery.\"Wormuth, the Army secretary, said seeing the training also underscored other lessons the U.S. is taking from the war in Ukraine.\"As we’re watching what’s happening to the Russians now, it’s informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,\" she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and the terrain in Europe is muddier, not like the hard-packed sand of the desert.The Army, she said, has to determine \"what’s the right balance between the mobility of a tank, the survivability of a tank and the lethality of a tank. If you want to make it more mobile, you make it lighter, but that makes it less survivable. And so you have to decide where you’re going to take risks.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/us-army-using-lessons-from-ukraine-war-to-aid-own-training", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2833_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Soldiers from the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, prepare an attack during an early morning training exercise at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, April 12, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2833_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/us-army-ukraine-training-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, right, talks with Army Col.

{"title": "California visual artist helps kids heal from the horrors of war", "body": "Photographer and visual artist Brian McCarty, based in Los Angeles, has gotten glimpses of the horrible toll that violent conflicts all over the world have had on children under the age of 13.It's an ugly picture, to be sure — but there is hope. Through McCarty's War Toys art series, which he started in 2011 and is now a nonprofit endeavor — he's helping kids heal. More than that, his work is instructing and informing others on how to help children traumatized by war all over the globe. McCarty tells the stories of young war survivors by recreating the difficult moments that children have depicted during art therapy sessions.Sourcing toys from the countries where the conflicts have taken place, McCarty portrays the war recollections based on each child’s real-life drawing. Each art piece is done in partnership with the mental health professional who oversees the art therapy sessions.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2969_News_0>He’s worked with children who have survived conflicts in Israel, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria — and so far McCarty is seeing similarities going on in the Russia-Ukraine war.\"It's tough. The things that especially the Syrian kids have been [through is] just unbelievable,\" McCarty told Fox News Digital during a phone interview. \"From barrel bombs to this whole shoot-to-wound policy that's going on for them … It's basically — the regime or [whoever] figured out — you can just shoot someone and wound them, [and] that means all these people have to take care of them, as opposed to, if you kill them, they’re just dead. And so they would literally shoot kids and wound them so that their parents would stop fighting and take care of them.\"McCarty continued, \"I think we're seeing a lot of parallels in Ukraine to what happened in Syria — a lot of similar actions.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2969_News_1>An estimated 4.3 million children so far have been displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war. Only about 1.8 million of those children have become refugees who have fled Ukraine for a neighboring country, according to UNICEF’s war recap on Friday, April 8.McCarty said it’ll likely take several weeks or months before he’s able to share the stories from Ukrainian children. That's because he insists on working with expressive therapists who interview their clients in a \"safe\" and \"responsible\" way.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2969_News_2>Eventually, the children are invited \"to share a story about their life that they want the rest of the world to know\" — not \"‘draw me the worst thing that happened to you,’\" he told Fox News Digital.In his opinion, mutual trust should be achieved, and the process shouldn’t be rushed. Each child who participates in the War Toys series spends about three hours with an expressive therapist. The therapists help the children get into a \"headspace\" where they feel comfortable enough sharing details about their lives, according to McCarty. Many of the participants in past projects, however, draw heartbreaking and chilling scenes that range from bombings, shootings and burned-down homes to everyday life at refugee camps, checkpoints controlled by adversaries and dangerous border crossings.\"It’s tough to witness,\" McCarty said. \"I’m in awe, though, of people like Myra Saad, the therapist I work with — that’s her job. She does it day in and day out, and I don’t know how. It takes a certain breed of someone to be able to take those stories, internalize it, help the children and still go to bed at night and kiss your kids and be happy.\"McCarty began his War Toys series in 2011 with his \"Wall Shooting\" piece. It's a work of art that’s based on a young boy’s depiction of a friend being shot at the Israeli Separation Barrier, a border wall between Israel and Palestine.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2969_News_3>\"To recreate the moment, I bought toys from shops in the Arab Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City and traveled just past the Kalandia Checkpoint on the road to Ramallah,\" McCarty recalled. \"By the time I had the toys composed in front of the camera, a massive group of protesters had descended on the checkpoint. They were chanting and advancing on Israeli soldiers manning the post, now in full riot gear.\"McCarty continued, \"When the stun grenades and tear gas started going off, I had to choose why I was there. Would I stop and actually experience the events happening just behind me, or continue ‘playing with toys’ in front of the camera? I realized that I wasn't there to witness these moments of violence and protest.\"He added, \"There were photojournalists on both sides capturing the chaotic scene at the checkpoint, but no one else there to articulate what these children had experienced and still feared.\" The singular project eventually evolved into the advocacy-focused series that it is today, which has used toys to bridge the gap between people who have experienced war and civilians who struggle to understand the harsh realities these children face. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2969_News_4>\"The reactions [that I’ve gotten] are really positive,\" McCarty told Fox News Digital. \"The children we work with, when they get to see [their work turned into] photos — we'll get these really interesting critiques and the sort of unfiltered honesty you get from kids.\"McCarty launched the nonprofit element of War Toys in December 2019 with a goal to create \"unique programs\" that \"have a direct impact on children everywhere, not just in war zones.\"Currently, McCarty and his team are researching and developing generic toy designs that they intend to provide manufacturers as a way to positively impact the development of children living in low-income areas. \"With [the] generic toy industry, the toys that are available to children, at the lowest economic levels — no one's investing in the designs and quality,\" McCarty said. \"So, we're going to invest, and we're just going to give the industry better designs.\"An example of the positive impact War Toys is trying to make in the generic toy industry includes a prototype combat photojournalist that can be packaged with bags of plastic soldiers.\"Small as the change might appear, we’ll give children more play options than ‘us versus them,’ while acknowledging the vital work of women and men who risk their lives to document war, often shoulder to shoulder with soldiers,\" McCarty said.War Toys is also spreading awareness for First Aid of the Soul, a grassroots organization that’s working to provide mental health services to people who have survived the Russia-Ukraine war.\"At this time, as First Aid of the Soul is grassroots, we are continuing to build our network of mental health professionals in Ukraine and globally and discussing possible directions moving forward,\" said Nathalie Robelot-Timtchenko, founder and executive director at First Aid of the Soul. McCarty told Fox News Digital that there have been times when he’s had to put his own feelings aside in order to accurately capture the stories that are shared with him.\"Third-party trauma is something that can be challenging to manage,\" he said. \"To articulate the children’s accounts, I have to really listen, immerse myself and imagine these moments in their shoes. So a lot gets absorbed and mixed in with my own, sometimes less-than-awesome, experiences.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_2969_News_5>McCarty continued, \"I’m incredibly lucky in that I get to leave these war zones and come back to a lot of love and support, including a therapist who really earns her fee.\"He referenced an analogy he once heard that compared the weight of traumatic experiences to the weight of loaded train cars.\"It gets heavier over time, but things don’t go off the rails, so to speak, until the train stops and all of that weight smashes into the back,\" McCarty said. \"This is why trained mental health professionals are key to processing trauma — they know how to help lighten the load and bring things to a safer stop.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/california-visual-artist-kids-heal-horros-war", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_2969_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Brian McCarty created his War Toys \"Sderot Home\" art piece in 2012.

{"title": "Rep. Mike Turner describes 'disheartening despair' at Polish refugee facility, blames Putin for atrocities", "body": "Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, spoke with Fox News Digital while on a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Northeast Poland-Ukraine border, and described the \"heartbreaking\" effects on Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war.Turner, who serves as the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, traveled to Poland's border with Ukraine over the weekend with House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Republican Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., Rep. like Garcia, R-Calif., Rep. Michele Fischbach, R-Minn., and Democratic Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida and Kathleen Rice of New York.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3030_News_0>The lawmakers met with Polish officials, along with representatives from the U.S. and NATO, and had conversations centered around the \"local Polish response,\" particularly on logistics and care for those Ukrainians who have been displaced.They also had briefings on how to get weapons into the hands of Ukrainians to defend against Russian forces, which Turner told Fox News Digital should have happened way earlier if the Biden administration had immediately responded to pleas for assistance.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3030_News_1>\"It would have been so much more timely if Biden had responded and provided weapons to Ukraine earlier. And seeing the logistics now and knowing that it's happening during a conflict, during war, we would have been able to get weapons in and there may have been able to actually repel the Russian invasion instead of now as they're fighting to try to reclaim land that Russia is bombing,\" said Turner.Discussions revolved around what Ukraine needs for \"surface-to-air missiles and sea defenses to be able to try to address Russia's threat.\"The congress members also toured a Polish refugee facility, which Turner said was \"heartbreaking\" to witness.\"This is just heartbreaking to see the effects of people who are fleeing the war, with just the belongings that they could grab. With their young kids, perhaps just trying to seek safety. It becomes even that much clearer as you see the people who are fleeing war, that this is really just about one person. This is about Putin,\" Turner told Fox News Digital. He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is to blame for the war's atrocities and the horrific reality for refugees that he witnessed.\"This isn't a geopolitical conflict. It's not war between nations. It's not a natural disaster. This is absolutely Vladimir Putin, who is mercilessly bombing a nation, indiscriminately killing innocent people and causing millions to have to flee.\"Turner said that the \"immediacy\" of the Ukrainian refugees' needs is extremely serious, stating that many have health concerns. There are \"food needs, clothing, logistics to get them somewhere else into Poland,\" among other pressing issues.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3030_News_2>\"Many of them don't know anybody here. So they're coming into a country where they are not looking to get assistance from friends or other relatives. Just that disheartening despair of being displaced and also knowing that they don't know how long they will be here, and they don't know what condition their country will be in, or their families will be in, when they return,\" Turner told Fox News Digital.In response to reports that Putin may be shaking up his leadership team and reorganizing military operations in Ukraine, Turner said despite any changes, Putin's objective remains the same.\"It's evident on the ground in Ukraine that Russia is moving its troops around and maybe executing new plans.But what is very clear to everyone who is watching this is that Putin's end game and goal has not changed.\"\"And also, since we know that Putin's designs include the Baltics and Eastern Europe, it even makes it that much more desperate that Ukraine have the ability to defend itself against Russia. No one believes that if Russia regroups and just takes a portion of Ukraine that that will be the end of this conflict. And so we want to make that as impossible for Putin as that can be.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3030_News_3>Turner concluded by saying that the lawmakers plan to head back to the U.S. Capitol and convey to their colleagues and the Biden administration the most pressing needs of the Ukrainian government on both the humanitarian side and the military side. \"And our goal is, of course, to return back to the capital with this information to try to support efforts to get in their hands things that they need to defend themselves and to meet the needs of their countrymen.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3030_News_4>The top Intelligence Committee Republican said that he hopes the Biden administration recognizes how dangerous the situation is for the entire globe, and that it is \"critical\" that the U.S. respond by sending more lethal aid.\"This is a major and serious conflict that shows that Putin is certainly willing to kill innocent people and to disrupt an entire nation. And I hope the administration's understanding of how dangerous this makes him and how dangerous the situation is both for Europe, the United States, NATO.

Before we can solve anything, we need to go item-by-item to understand the insanity, incompetence, and destructiveness which historians will someday write defined the \"Biden Disaster.\"Many of these will show up in future columns. Each item represents a threat to America economically, in national security, or culturally. Many will take a generation or more to recover from or solve. This list is not in any particular order because it is so destructive – and in some cases so weird – I’m not sure a specific sequence exists. Taken together they represent a pattern that will alienate most Americans. If they come to define the modern Democratic Party, the Democrats may turn into a small minority faction for a generation or longer. The Biden administration’s spending policies are driving inflationary pressure as the Federal Reserve plans to expand an already bloated money supply to accommodate the left’s insatiable need for more cash. The stubborn policy against American oil and gas is guaranteeing pain at the pump and sending heating oil and fertilizer prices soaring. The loss of Ukraine and much of Russia as sources of food and fertilizer will guarantee higher food prices – which will cause more pain than gasoline prices.Putin has more than 5,000 nuclear weapons, and he is adjusting the Russian economy to survive the sanctions. Biden will look impotent, and Putin will look like a vicious, brutal survivor.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3056_News_0> The theocratic dictatorship will not deal directly with America, so our negotiations are handled through the Russian ambassador.

Biden is so pathetic he has made Neville Chamberlain look strong. Ukrainians die every day while American bureaucrats and politicians fail to get them the help they deserve.The profit-over-patriotism cycle in the big corporations will presently lead to a massive popular repudiation. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3056_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3056_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3056_News_3>President Donald Trump in Michigan warned: \"We should have zero tolerance for woke CEOs who get rich off the world's worst human rights abusers abroad while they push radical politics in our classrooms here at home. Giant corporations that do business in Communist China while they attack our values here in America should face a massive and crushing tax on all profits made in China. They should lose all tax breaks and all preferential treatment under U.S. law.\"Congress should pass a bill that only the American flag, and state or host country flags, can be flown on government property, including embassies. Pure direct infanticide is now part of the modern Democratic Party. So, Biden nominates a Supreme Court Justice who gives light sentences to convicted pedophiles. Democrats increasingly favor the criminal over the victim and the lawbreaker over the law enforcer. To be clear: This disaster is not born of incompetence and its not inevitable. The Biden administration policy is to allow the maximum number of people to illegally enter the United States. In New York City and other leftwing jurisdictions there is growing pressure to let people who are here illegally vote. The upcoming rule to drop public health requirements while Americans are still required to wear masks on airplanes is another example of the passion Democrats have for hurting Americans and helping people who come here illegally.

In the first three days of Russia's invasion, the company was focused on helping American expats, corporate executives and senior leadership from firms that hired Global Guardian to leave the country. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_0>\"I would say that by day three … firms started to realize that this is real and not going away. And I think by day four, you saw a pivot. The aperture opened because they realized that you can't just evacuate the executive or your employee. You've got to take the whole family. So, by about day five, you know, we were evacuating children, spouses … by day six or seven, grandparents, extended family. This truly did become a humanitarian effort, and I think most of our clients realized that in less than a week,\" Buckner told Fox News Digital.He added that \"almost every single evacuation we execute involves family – nuclear family and extended family and, of course, pets.\"The D.C.-based security company has Ukrainian clients in the Fortune 1000, as well as the tech, financial banking, private equity and manufacturing industries.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_1>\"Unlike my competitors in the insurance market, I don't deploy expats, meaning ex-Secret Service, ex-FBI … I don't deploy people like that. Our teams are standing there. I like to think we were there before the war, we'll be there during the war, and we're going to be there after the war. I said that about Afghanistan,\" Buckner said.Global Guardian currently has two teams in Ukraine, and more in Romania, Poland, Hungary and other European countries where Ukrainian refugees are seeking safety. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_2>The company sent an intelligence brief to its clients about a month before Russia's invasion warning them that it was \"highly probable that the Russians are actually going to take action\" and that they needed to \"get ready,\" Buckner said.The process is complex, and evacuations that would normally take one or two days are taking up to five due to destroyed bridges, a lack of public transportation options and long lines at the Ukrainian border.\"You're always looking for the safe zone in these scenarios, and so … this all comes down to the following: having good communication, executing an expectation and preparation, and then having a very precise time and location of pickup,\" Buckner explained.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_3>Global Guardian receives detailed lists of who needs help, where to find them, and how to communicate with them. Once the company has received that information, it will meet those people at their address or give them instructions on where to meet Global Guardian agents. Those instructions often include a list of what materials to bring and what conditions to dress for, as they may be exposed to the elements from anywhere between 24 and 36 hours.\"The takeaway is good communication, good preparation, and then just expect to wait and expect bridges to be out, expect to get hemmed up in checkpoints, so on and so forth,\" Buckner said. War zones in Ukraine have made evacuations more difficult because the Russians have destroyed roads and bridges and installed mines, booby traps and \"carnage on the way out,\" Buckner said. Buildings and city centers have been bombed. Buses and trains have been destroyed or blocked from entering certain cities. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_4>In Kyiv, Buckner said his partners on the ground have described a visible decrease in Russian forces after the Kremlin announced about a week ago that it would be scaling back its forces in the Ukrainian capital, but the \"caveat\" is that Russia is now buying time \"to expand\" in Donbas, create a land bridge all the way to the Black Sea and attempt to take Odesa. Only then, if they successfully take control of Odesa, will they declare \"victory,\" Buckner believes.\"They [will] take warm water seaports they did not have for oil and gas delivery and shipment, and then … they can claim that victory. … They will claim that territory as now Russian territory, we will redraw the lines of new Ukraine, if you will,\" the former Green Beret said.He also believes that while negotiations may stop momentarily if Russia gains control of southern Ukraine, Russia will attempt to expand all the way to NATO countries such as Romania, Hungary and Poland in the future.\"I think their ultimate goal is to expand west, all the way right up to the border. They're not there. They're incapable of doing it right now. They don't have the manpower. They don't have equipment to take the entire country. I think that's now clear. And I think that's why … they've been forced to change their strategy going from Donbas to Crimea,\" Buckner said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/former-green-beret-ukrainians-safety", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Destruction in Ukraine captured by a Global Guardian agent.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/destruction2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Global Guardians executes evacuations in Ukraine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-dd41758c332c4233e7709590edf2167d-V.jpg"}, {"caption": "Tank in Ukraine captured by a Global Guardian agent.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/tank.jpg"}, {"caption": "Global Guardian evacuation route map.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/evacuation-map.jpg"}, {"caption": "Destruction in Ukraine captured by a Global Guardian agent.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3173_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/destruction.jpg"}]}

The car was carrying containers of flammable substances and burst into flames upon impact. Police said the driver rammed into the gate at about 6 a.m. local time – but it did not enter the Bucharest embassy compound.While firefighters were able to put out the blaze, the man died at the scene.The case prosecutor, Bogdan Staicu, told reporters that the containers found inside the car will be examined by forensics experts.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_3>The crash is under investigation and an autopsy is set to be carried out. The embassy said no employees were injured in the incident and expressed its condolences to the driver's family.\"We must state with regret that whatever the motives of the driver,\" the embassy said in a statement, \"there is no doubt that he committed this act under the influence of an explosion of anti-Russian hysteria in connection with a staged provocation in the city of Bucha.\"Russia's ambassador to Romania, Valery Kuzmin, told a Russian state-owned television channel that the embassy has \"repeatedly\" received threats by email, according to the state news agency Tass. \"The atmosphere that has been gradually forming here is very tense,\" Kuzmin said.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine started on Feb. 24, protesters have gathered outside Russia's embassy in the capital. On Tuesday, Romania – which shares a border with Ukraine and has taken in more than 600,000 refugees – ordered 10 diplomats from the embassy expelled following a string of expulsions of Russian officials across the 27-nation European Union.Romania’s Foreign Ministry said the actions of 10 embassy workers \"contravene the provisions of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relationships.\"Meanwhile, Western governments prepared Wednesday to toughen sanctions against Russia and send more weapons to Ukraine.Images of dead civilians lining the streets of Bucha and other cities have shocked the world in recent days and the U.S. plans to seek a vote this week to suspend Russia from its seat on the United Nations' top human rights body", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/russian-embassy-romania-gate-rammed-car-flammable-substances", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Police in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, say a car crashed into the gate of the Russian Embassy, bursting into flames and killing the driver.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Russian-Embassy-Car-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "Romanian serviceman stands guard near the Russian Embassy in Bucharest, Romania, Wednesday, April 6, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Russian-Embassy-Car-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Russia's flag flies over the country's embassy in Bucharest, Romania, Wednesday, April 6, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Russian-Embassy-Car-3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Romanian serviceman wearing protective gear covers the car that crashed into the gates of the Russian Embassy in Bucharest, Romania, Wednesday, April 6, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3181_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Russian-Embassy-Car-4.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Ohio athlete raises over $12K for Ukraine on stair climber, reveals her biggest motivating factor", "body": "An 18-year-old athlete climbed her way to $12,500 in support of the country of Ukraine after she walked a stair climber for 24 hours at her local gym. Originally from Ukraine, Sadovska told Fox News Digital that she was born in Lviv. When she was 9 months old, her family moved to the U.S. — Ohio, specifically.  Aside from her parents, her brother and an aunt and uncle, all other members of Sadovska’s family are still in Ukraine. Hosting a fundraiser to support her home country seemed like the natural thing for her to do. \"We’re Skyping them nearly every day,\" Sadovska told Fox News Digital. \"And they’re doing OK physically, but they’re just really stressed out.\" She added, \"They’re in their basement and [are] just trying to do their best to stay calm and stay safe.\"To raise funds for those struggling in Ukraine, Sadovska walked on a stair climber from 6 a.m. on Saturday, March 26, until 6 a.m. on Sunday, March 27.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3239_News_0>Sadovska — who lives in Cleveland who will be swimming for Ohio State University this fall — livestreamed the fundraiser on TikTok for the full 24 hours. She also posted several videos of the event on her TikTok page. The first video has been viewed more than 13.1 million times, while another video was viewed more than 3.2 million times.Sadovska said she was inspired to hold a fundraiser after she learned that members of a swim team in the U.K., at the University of Central Lancashire, were swimming 346.4 miles — that's the total area size of Ukraine.\"Obviously, it was something crazy that they did,\" Sadovska said, adding the team swam in support of Ukraine.That \"crazy\" fundraiser inspired her to think of her own project.\"I knew [that working out on] the Stairmaster was hard. I knew it would grab a lot of attention, so I decided to do that and see how much money we could raise,\" Sadovska said.Sadovska added that she’s noticed videos on TikTok showing people doing stair climbing machines for 90 minutes. \"All of those [videos] were blowing up, so I decided to do 24 [hours],\" Sadovska said. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3239_News_1>Although she is an athlete and regularly works out, Sadovska said she didn’t do any special training or preparation for her fundraiser. She also said she had only worked out on a stair climber \"a couple times\" before the 24-hour challenge. \"I just went into it and hoped for the best,\" Sadovska said.Sadovska said that once she got started, the first 12 hours of her fundraiser were \"fine.\"\"The time was going by fast,\" she said. \"I had the viewers on the [TikTok livestream] and my friends around me, pushing me and supporting me.\" She said that for the first 12 hours, her two best friends were with her to refill her water, give her snacks and keep her company.At the halfway point, another friend arrived and spent \"multiple hours\" with her, even joining her on the stair climber beside her for an hour. That friend also came back at the end of the fundraiser and did the stair climber again for Sadovska’s last hour. Even with the help, though, things got tough, Sadovska said. \"After the 12-hour mark, I had my 10-minute break — which was the longest break I had — and then from there, time just slowed down so much,\" she added. \"That’s when the pain was really bad.\"Though she did think about stopping \"multiple times,\" Sadovska said she was encouraged by her friends who were with her at the gym and her viewers on the livestream. \"I knew I had to keep going, because the longer I went, the more money I would raise,\" she said.Sadovska also got news early on that gave her extra motivation when things got tough.\"It was getting really difficult,\" Sadovska said. \"But my parents actually called me when I was a couple [of] hours into this fundraiser. They told me that a missile landed two miles away from where I used to live and where my family currently lives in Ukraine.\"\"That was my biggest motivating factor,\" she added.During the climb, Sadovska said she didn’t listen to any music or podcasts and instead, she was airing her livestream. She also took a few short breaks, which she did not include in her 24-hour countdown.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3239_News_2>During her walk, Sadovska said she ate high-carb and high-sugar snacks such as beef jerky, protein bars, fruit bars, dried fruit, gummies and Pop-Tarts. \"Not the healthiest, but it kept my blood sugar and glycogen high so I could push through the 24 hours,\" Sadovska said. She added that she also had \"tons of water,\" sports drinks and electrolyte drink mix on hand. Dr. Robert Parisien, an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon at Mount Sinai in New York City, told Fox News Digital that for an average person to do a 24-hour stair climber workout, that person would need to prepare for at least three months, \"if not longer,\" in order to prevent injury and do the event safely. \"This is really something that you would need to prepare for, much like an endurance athlete would prepare for an event, or even an ultra-endurance athlete, like an ultra-marathon runner,\" Parisien said. Average people who may be considering doing an event like Sadovska's should make sure they have a solid base of physical fitness; they should also taper their workouts before the event. That way, their muscles can recover and be at \"peak physical condition\" in time for the event, Parisien said. He also encouraged people to make sure they have appropriate gear and equipment on hand. That includes petroleum jelly, bandages, protective adhesive to help with blisters, as well as multiple pairs of sneakers that are already broken in, multiple pairs of socks and other dry clothes to alternate wearing during the event. Another \"vital\" element to a 24-hour workout is having a nutritional plan, Parisien said. He said that it’s important to take in carbs and calories and to be hydrating \"throughout this entire event.\"\"You really need to be taking in probably about 100 to 250 carb calories per hour after the first hour of competing,\" Parisien said. \"You can’t just go into this event without having that [nutrition] plan in place, because that needs to be organized and set up ahead of time.\"During an event like this, Parisien said people should remember to be \"slow and steady\" and start out at a \"conservative\" pace so that they don’t burn through all their energy too early. He also encouraged people to take small breaks for changing clothes and shoes and even stretching, \"just to decrease your chance of injury,\" he said. \"Let’s face it, this has a high chance of injury,\" he added. \"It may be that she has muscle strains that take days or weeks to recover from, or maybe it could even be something more severe, where you actually tear a large part of your muscle or your tendon if you’re not prepared for this event,\" he added.In the case of Sadovska, who didn’t have much preparation, Parisien said that as a young, physical fit athlete, she is the exception.Parisien said he himself has done endurance events and covered similar events as a doctor; he said he appreciated Sadovska’s efforts.\"I think it’s a wonderful thing, a very altruistic thing that she did to raise money and to utilize her skill set, which is being a young, healthy athlete,\" Parisien said. \"It’s very impressive.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3239_News_3>\"It just shows the power of what any of us can do just by utilizing whatever our strengths are,\" he added.During her 24-hour stair climber workout, Sadovska collected money using a bucket beside her machine for in-person donations, as well as through her livestream and a GoFundMe page she set up. In total, she raised about $12,500 — way above her original goal of $5,000.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3239_News_4>\"It’s absolutely insane,\" Sadovska said of the donations received from people all over the world. \"I don’t even know how it happened, but I’m so grateful.\"Sadovska said she will be giving all in-person donations that she received at the gym to a local Ukrainian bank that sends money directly to people in Ukraine.Meanwhile, all the funds raised on her GoFundMe page went directly to the organization Ukraine Relief. \"It’s something very little and it’s not going to prevent what’s going on [in Ukraine], but it was the most I could do, so it makes me proud and happy,\" she said.Sadovska also wanted to bring awareness to and support a no-fly zone over Ukraine. During her stair climb, she posted a petition for a no-fly zone and received 2,000 signatures.Since she finished her fundraiser last Sunday morning (March 27), Sadovska said her recovery has gone well. She said she’s been taking Epsom salt baths and ice baths; she even did cryotherapy (cold therapy). Sadovska said she’s also been stretching, resting and taking supplements and vitamins. \"The legs were really sore and the knees were in a lot of pain, but I’m almost fully recovered,\" she noted.As she’s allowing her body to recover, Sadovska is processing her newfound internet fame and will use her platform for more challenges in the future.  Sadovska said her friends and family are proud and pleased with the outcome of her viral exercise event.\"I am so blessed and grateful to have had such supportive friends by my side helping me stay positive and push through the 24 hours,\" she added.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/ohio-athlete-12k-ukraine-stair-climber-motivating-factor", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3239_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Olena Sadovska, 18, from Cleveland, Ohio, will be swimming for Ohio State University in the fall.

{"title": "Brooklyn-based nonprofit delivers 'blankets of hope' to people in need", "body": "Hundreds of school children across the nation are sending blankets wrapped in handwritten notes of encouragement to people experiencing homelessness, including Ukrainians who were forced to flee their country after Russia's invasion.It's a way to remind these individuals that they are not alone. The effort started six years ago when two brothers from Brooklyn, Mike and Nick Fiorito, quit their day jobs to embark on a more meaningful life. They were on a mission to figure out how the world could become kinder. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_0>One day they had a burst of inspiration. They started hand-delivering what they call \"blankets of hope\" to people living on the streets of New York City. It started as a family project, but it quickly turned into a \"global movement of kindness,\" according to Herndon Graddick, director of the Blankets of Hope nonprofit. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_1>With the help of venture capitalist Todd Chaffee, the duo turned their side project into a global nonprofit, Blankets of Hope, which \"helps students practice empathy & kindness in an impactful service-learning experience,\" according to the nonprofit's website. \"If you want to start a movement of kindness, you start with kids,\" Graddick said.  Hundreds of schools around the nation have registered with the nonprofit, so their students can \"understand the life-changing benefits of giving back,\" its website says. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_2>Once a school registers online, Blankets of Hope will send them a shipment of the blankets and directions on how to host \"Kindness Workshops\" with their students. During these workshops, the kids write handwritten notes with sayings such as \"hang in there\" or \"You matter. I hope you stay warm,\" to people in need. The notes are then affixed to blankets, which are fully funded by donations sent to Blankets of Hope.  \"Every penny donated goes to the work,\" Graddick said, adding that all other expenses are handled internally. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_3>The blankets are then sent to homeless shelters or directly given out to people on the streets. Since September, 50,000 children have written notes and sent blankets to around 50,000 people in need, according to Graddick. A school in New York started working with organizations to send their blankets and letters to Ukrainian refugees after Russian forces invaded their country, driving millions of people from their homes into boarding countries. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_4>\"One way that people experience homelessness is war. We're seeing the biggest migration of homeless people in Europe in 80 years,\" he said. \"And so we thought, how could we help make a difference?\"As the war persists, the nonprofit plans to scale its work in Ukraine to help even more refugees. \"We’re currently in discussion with major global partners about significantly scaling the operation,\" Graddick said. \"We want the Ukrainian refugees to know the world cares.\" The nonprofit is working to \"teach people to be kind\" all over the world and has already partnered with schools in 44 states across the nation and in three countries around the world.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/blankets-of-hope-nonprofit-homeless-shelters-ukraine", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Students writing handwritten notes to people in need for Blankets of Hope.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Blankets-of-hope-4-gigapixel-low_res-scale-2_00x.jpg"}, {"caption": "Students writing handwritten notes to people in need for Blankets of Hope.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Blankets-of-hope-6-gigapixel-low_res-scale-2_00x.jpg"}, {"caption": "Students writing handwritten notes to people in need for Blankets of Hope.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Blankets-of-hope-3-gigapixel-low_res-scale-2_00x.jpg"}, {"caption": "Students writing handwritten notes to people in need for Blankets of Hope.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Blankets-of-hope-5-gigapixel-low_res-scale-2_00x.jpg"}, {"caption": "Students writing handwritten notes to people in need for Blankets of Hope.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3267_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Blankets-of-hope-gigapixel-low_res-scale-2_00x.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Boston-based Ukrainian woman reveals text from brother amid war: 'We are alive'", "body": "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Angela Sokolova, a holistic health and wellness coach based in the Boston area, described the perilous journey her Ukraine-based brother and his family were forced to take after Russian forces began invading their country Feb. 24.She also described a text from her brother and his family that brought her joy, even amid the devastation and destruction suffered by Ukrainians.\"It's very, very tough, what is happening to them right now,\" Sokolova said, sighing deeply as she discussed her beloved family members and her worry for them, given the war and the fact that her brother has lost virtually everything. \"A lot of people who were trapped in Mariupol and couldn't escape — they stayed without water, electricity, heat and food for a long, long time.\"And when they got out, \"many of these people — I don't think they were really aware of what was going on,\" she added. \"When you've been in a basement for a long time [because of the bombing], you lose a connection with the outside world.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_0>So when her family members finally emerged after weeks from their underground hiding places, \"all they wanted to do was find a safe place,\" she said.She said her brother, his wife, their two children and other Ukrainians \"were taken by a bus to a safe place\" once they emerged from hiding.But they soon recognized \"that this was a Russian system that was supporting the evacuation of refugees,\" she said, \"and that this [system] was bringing them across the border [from Ukraine] to Russia.\"A lot of refugees from Mariupol, she said, \"were not able to go [westward] into Ukraine because it was blocked.\" She said her family very much wanted to go to safer spots within their own country but could not.Some people tried to go deeper into Ukraine anyway — from Mariupol, moving westward — \"but they were killed, or they were lost,\" said Sokolova. \"They didn't know which way to go. If you're in shock, you act in the moment.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_1>She added, \"So they all got on a bus\" — then found out it was eventually headed toward Russia.When they arrived in the Donetsk region, north of Mariupol, Sokolova said, \"They texted us. All they said was, ‘We are alive.’\"That was after three weeks of silence and fear — three weeks of waiting to know how they were doing or what had happened. \"It was three weeks that we didn't hear from them,\" Sokolova said.  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_2>And while Sokolova and her mother, 81 — who to this day remains in Ukraine in a spot that's currently safe and not far from the capital of Kyiv — were both overjoyed to know their family was safe, \"at the same time, this was heartbreaking for us.\"So now, Sokolova said, \"my mom is alone in Ukraine.\"She said her brother and his family \"were transported to several refugee camps. They were moved to one Russian town, where they remain now. [The Russians] were asking them if they had any documents or if they had any relatives in Russia. And those who did have relatives in Russia, they could go to their relatives or friends, get picked up by them, and go with them [into Russia].\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_3>She added, \"But if the Ukrainians didn't have documents or relatives in Russia, then those people were moved to some camps.\" At these \"camps,\" she said, the Ukrainian people have been \"given simple jobs to do and given some money, too.\" Throughout the ordeal, she \"was working so hard to find help for my brother among my Russian friends.\"Sokolova explained that she grew up in the Soviet Union near the Odesa area of Ukraine. \"My friends and I, we had fathers who were military officers who served the Soviet Union in many different areas of the country,\" she said.She moved to the U.S. with her husband when the Soviet Union collapsed.But as she continued to hear \"terrible, terrible news about Ukrainian refugees in Russia\" and their plight, she had to keep praying for her family amid the turmoil, uncertainty and worry.\"Uncertainty is the worst,\" Sokolova said. \"This is the biggest fear [for people], not knowing what is ahead. I believe in God. I believe in good people — good, open-hearted, kind-hearted people — in any country.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_4>She said she kept telling her mother every time they talked by phone, \"Let's pray that everything is going to be all right with them. Let's just have that faith. They're going to be alive and be supported by really good people. Let's just keep praying.\"Sokolova was happy to hear that Russian volunteers who have been helping the Ukrainian refugees actually \"have been very supportive.\" \"They even organized showers for my brother and his family,\" she added, \"because, remember, they were underground in basements, hiding out for many, many weeks and then traveling. They were in the same clothes, hadn't been able to wash.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_5>She said the texts from her brother and his wife have mostly been abrupt — just a few words to let her know they're still alive and OK for now. \"We still don't have a good connection,\" she said. She said some of her friends in Russia were trying to find an apartment for her brother and his family. Her brother is part of a health and wellness meditative group. So he and his family were offered \"a place to rest\" in Russia to get their bearings.\"I was blown away\" by this kindness, said Sokolova.Her niece, 14, and her nephew, 10, have been keeping their spirits up with artwork. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_6>\"This is my personal, individual story,\" added Sokolova. \"I have no judgment of others.\"She said she doesn't want to feel anger over what has been happening in Ukraine, though so many people she knows feel anger toward Putin and Russia.\"I am not that person. Through years of practicing, I have learned that anger can destroy,\" said Sokolova. \"It takes time to forgive — to heal — and it's going to be years now of trauma that people will be experiencing because of this war. All of this will take time to heal.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_7>She said her brother has meditated since the 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed, and she believes this has helped keep him alive and move forward. Her brother has also been teaching others to meditate after years of working in an iron and steel factory in Ukraine. \"He developed a network of other similar-minded people. We could never have imagined years ago that this network could now help support him and sustain him.\" About her own work on meditation, breathing and other wellness techniques, Sokolova said, \"This is my way to bring more peace into the world. I've been doing it for many years.\"She said her meditations have focused on imagining \"a gold dome over my family, keeping them safe, protecting them\" through the war and the violence. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News_8>\"With my mom, this is what we would imagine and pray for — to keep my brother and his family safe and alive,\" she said.She said she has been collecting money and donations for Ukrainian refugees and will continue to do that and send money to her brother whenever or however she can. For now, she believes her brother and his family are in a stable place.\"It's a relief,\" she said. But she also said it was \"heartbreaking\" to see how they look in photos. \"They look so much older now. They look so thin, so sad, with such dark eyes — heartbreaking,\" she said. \"But I believe that people are ready to help them and that this trauma, eventually, will be healed.\"She also told Fox News Digital about her efforts at self-care, \"I am trying to keep myself in a resourceful state while supporting them and other people.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/boston-ukrainian-text-brother-alive", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3322_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "This Ukraine family — after hiding from bombing and shelling in basements for weeks — managed to get out of their war-torn country alive.

{"title": "Three ways Christians can respond to the crisis in Ukraine", "body": "Just when you thought it could not get any worse, it did. We survived the worst pandemic in modern history, and now, when we were finally catching our breath, it seems like the world is on fire.Russia’s blistering attack on Ukraine under President Vladimir Putin is a powderkeg that threatens the whole world. This situation has escalated alarmingly fast as Russia, now entrenched in Ukraine, has threatened to use biological and chemical weapons. They have even issued a veiled threat to possibly use the nuclear option.Many warn these threats could lead to World War III. The last time I heard talk like that was when I was a child during what was known as the \"Cuban Missile Crisis.\" President John F. Kennedy and the leader of the then Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, went toe-to-toe as Soviets moved weapons to Cuba only miles from our shores. When we were children, adults told us to hide under our desks if an atomic bomb hit us.So, with all of this present turmoil in the world, how are we reacting in America?Understandably anxiety and stress plague many as they have watched the war unfold for more than a month now. Yet thousands of others party away on spring break. We should not \"Party Like It’s 1999,\" as Prince sang. We should pray like it is 2022.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3330_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3330_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3330_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3330_News_3>I believe this global conflict reminds us that Jesus Christ is coming back again. These are \"signs of the times\" that Jesus warned us about in Matthew 24, responding to the question of His disciples who asked, \"What will be the signs that you are coming back again?\"There are some things we can do today. These three things that come to mind for us as Christians.Please understand, I am not a \"prepper.\" (Though the idea of a fallout shelter has some appeal right now!)I am saying we need to prepare for the afterlife. Not just because of current events, but because nobody gets out of here alive. Death is inevitable for every person. The statistics on death are pretty impressive: One hundred percent of people die. But the good news is there is an afterlife. For the person who has put their faith in Christ, there is the promise of Heaven. Jesus said, \"I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am, you may be also\" (John 14:3).Heaven is a prepared place for prepared people. What if this was your last day on earth? Would you go to Heaven?Pray for an end to this attack on the people of Ukraine. Pray for the protection of and provision for the millions of Ukrainian refugees leaving their homes and fleeing for their lives. Support organizations like Samaritan’s Purse who are on the ground with help.Pray for our leadership, President Biden, his staff, his military advisers. Pray they act wisely and prudently in this hour. Pray that the Lord changes the heart of President Putin—that he turns from this wicked and reckless course.We should all be praying for peace. I wrote an article for The Jerusalem Post where I pointed out that sometimes Christians are wrongly portrayed as wanting to see Armageddon happen in our lifetime. So, whenever there is a conflict or catastrophe, we see it as a \"fulfillment of Bible prophecy.\" Nothing could be further from the truth.We are told in Scripture to \"pray for the peace of Jerusalem\" (Ps. 122:6). Jesus said, \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the children of God\" (Matt. 5:9). We should both pray for and work for peace in our world today. There is nothing we want more for our world.People need hope right now. According to a new poll from the American Psychological Association, many Americans are reporting very high levels of stress due to financial concerns, inflation, the pandemic and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.We need to preach some good news in this world of bad news. I know that the word \"preach\" is usually thought of negatively. (I.e., \"Don’t preach at me!\") But it’s a word that means to proclaim. Another way to put it is to \"make a recommendation.\" We preach every day to our friends or on Yelp as we opine about a new restaurant we found.But we are dealing with something far more critical than the best burger in town these days. We are talking about life and death issues, so I highly recommend that people turn to God right now. People need to know that a God in Heaven loves them and can enter their lives.I prayed with a man in the hospital this week due to vital organ failure. I asked him if he wanted Jesus Christ to enter his life, and he said yes. After praying, he called his sister and said that he now had personal peace and was ready to meet the Lord if he were to die.The Bible says, \"Prepare to meet your God!\" (Amos 4:12). Jesus told of end-times events, which I believe we are now witnessing, \"When you see these things begin to happen, look up, for your redemption is near\" (Luke 21:28).He did not tell us to freak out but to look up. Don’t be caught unawares.

The couple live in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, where Russian officials say they plan to scale back military operations after more than a month of fighting.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3553_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3553_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3553_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3553_News_3>\"We will still be fighting until the last drop of blood, but if Ukraine falls, then someone will be next. Russia never stops,\" Arieva told Fox News Digital. \"They have nothing. They have nothing to feed their people, but still, they will try to take other countries and bring their Russian world – and the Russian world looks like complete [destruction] and fear.\"In Kyiv, Russian forces have fallen back about 25 miles from the city's center, Arieva explained, and residents of the city who have been sheltering underground for weeks are finally coming up for air – even if only for a brief period of time before Russian soldiers advance again. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3553_News_4>Arieva and her husband were recently sent home from the Territorial Defense Force as more Ukrainians with military experience returned to the city and began volunteering. Now, they spend their time offering assistance to humanitarian programs, gathering food and water for those in need.\"The city is waking up. … Some shops are opening. Even some coffee shops. A little of them, but still. … I was in the Territorial Defense for a month, and the only coffee I had was this coffee you take out of a packet.

It was, like, three days ago, but I still remember it,\" Arieva said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3553_News_5>She and her husband expect the fighting to continue after this brief period of \"calm\" but are not sure how long it will go on.\"We really don't know how long it will take to win the war because like the situation on the first day – it was really hard fighting.

It was a risk because the Russians used techniques to try and break through the regular army … and enter the city. … But many guys don't have the proper equipment,\" he explained.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3553_News_7>He described a \"small win\" at the beginning of the war when the civilian task force that he helps lead successfully fired at Russian forces and kept them outside city limits. Since then, they have completed other combat missions and taken down \"sabotage groups.\" For about a week, it seemed as though his battalion was under attack of Russian artillery fire \"every hour,\" though none of his \"warrior brothers\" died throughout that time.

{"title": "Ukraine Holocaust survivors flee to Germany for safety", "body": "When the bombs started falling on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, last month, Tatyana Zhuravliova had a horrible deja vu: the 83-year-old Ukrainian Jew felt the same panic she suffered as a little girl when the Nazis were flying air attacks on her hometown of Odesa.\"My whole body was shaking, and those fears crept up again through my entire body — fears which I didn't even know were still hidden inside me,\" Zhuravliova said.Her eyes welled up with tears as she remembered how she hid under the table from the bombs during World War II, and eventually fled with her mother to Kazakhstan when the Nazis and their henchmen started massacring tens of thousands of Jews in Odesa.\"Now I'm too old to run to the bunker. So I just stayed inside my apartment and prayed that the bombs would not kill me,\" Zhuravliova, a retired doctor, told The Associated Press on Sunday.But as Russia's military attacks on Ukraine become even more brutal and demolished residential apartment blocks, she realized that she had to flee again if she didn't want to die. So Zhuravliova accepted an offer from a Jewish organization to bring her out of Ukraine to safety.In an unexpected twist of history, some of the 10,000 Holocaust survivors who had been living in Ukraine have now been taken to safety in Germany — the country that unleashed World War II and organized the murder of 6 million Jews across Europe.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3638_News_0>Zhuravliova was part of the first group of four Jewish Holocaust survivors evacuated from Ukraine by the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference. The group represents the world’s Jews in negotiating for compensation and restitution for victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs, and provides welfare for Holocaust survivors around the globe.A second group of 14 Holocaust survivors, many of them ill and bed-ridden, were brought out of Ukraine on Sunday. The Claims Conference is working with its partners, among them the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, or JDC, to get as many Holocaust survivors out of Ukraine as possible.Around 500 Holocaust survivors in Ukraine are especially in need of help because of their ailing health — their evacuation is a top priority, says the JDC.It's a highly difficult and complex operation to transport such frail people out of Ukraine, where constant shelling and artillery fire make any evacuation very dangerous. It involves finding medical staff and ambulances in numerous war zones, crossing international borders and even convincing survivors, who are ill and unable to leave their homes without help, to flee into uncertainty again, this time without the vigor of youth.However, the risks of staying behind are also very high. This month, 96-year-old Boris Romanchenko, who survived several Nazi concentration camps during World War II, was killed during an attack in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.It is not known if any other survivors have been killed in the war in Ukraine, but several have had their homes hit by shelling, says Amos Lev-Ran from the JDC.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3638_News_1>\"No one can imagine the nightmare survivors have lived through during the Holocaust,\" said Ruediger Mahlo, who works for the Claims Conference in Germany. \"Now they need to evacuate again — their security, all things familiar are again being stripped from them and they are forced to live with uncertainty and fear.\"Mahlo began coordinating the evacuations less than two weeks ago — speaking to government officials, diplomats, NGOs and border personnel to make it all happen.\"Getting them to a secure place of comfort and providing all we can is a top priority for us,\" Mahlo said, adding that he cried with relief after the first group made it out. \"Everybody was working like crazy, but still it is a miracle that we got them got out successfully.\"Upon their arrival in Germany, the elderly refugees are taken to Jewish or interfaith nursing homes across the country.As of last week, around 3,500 Ukrainian Jews — young and old — had arrived in Germany, and the government has already offered them a special path to permanent immigration as part of Germany’s ongoing efforts to compensate Jews since the Holocaust.Overall, German authorities have registered more than 250,000 refugees from Ukraine, although the real numbers are expected to be much higher since they don’t need a visa to enter.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3638_News_2>On Friday, Zhuravliova and two other 83-year-old survivors from Kyiv — Larisa Dzuenko and Galina Ulyanova — arrived on the outskirts of Frankfurt after a 26-hour-long trip and were put up at a nursing home. A fourth woman was put up at a different nursing home in the city.Ulyanova, who is so ill that she hadn't left her eighth-floor apartment for seven years, had to be carried down the stairs by two men to get on the ambulance in Kyiv. Dzuenko, a retired engineer, suffers from severe diabetes and had to be given intravenous infusions during the long ambulance ride.Both Ulyanova and Dzuenko were also traumatized as children when they had to escape with their parents from the Nazis. Ulyanova fled to Kyrgyzstan, and Dzuenko to Uzbekistan, before they eventually settled back in Kyiv.Sitting around a table with red-and-yellow tulips in a sunlit, spacious room in their nursing home on Sunday, the three women seemed relieved to be in Germany.\"Everyone is treating us so nicely here. The food is good, we are safe, and the staff so welcoming,\" said Ulyanova, a former nurse.\"When I was a little girl, I had to flee from the Germans with my mom to Uzbekistan, where we had nothing to eat and I was so scared of all those big rats there,\" remembered Dzuenko, a woman with a quick smile and big eyes. \"All my life I thought the Germans were evil, but now they were the first ones to reach out to us and rescue us.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3638_News_3>Zhuravliova said she was more than grateful to be in Germany now, despite the country's cruel treatment of Jews in the past.\"To me, it looks like this country has learned from the past and is trying to do something good for us now,\" she said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/ukraine-holocaust-survivors-germany", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3638_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Ukrainian Holocaust survivor Tatyana Zhuravliova reacts during an AP interview in an old people's home in Frankfurt, Germany, Sunday, March 27, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3638_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/ukraine-holocaust-survivor.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ukrainian Holocaust survivors Tatyana Zhuravliova, right, Larisa Dzuenko, left, and Galina Ulyanova pose for a photo during an AP interview in an old people's home in Frankfurt, Germany, Sunday, March 27, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3638_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/ukrainian-holocaust-survivors.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ukrainian Holocaust survivor Galina Ulyanova looks on during an AP interview in an old people's home in Frankfurt, Germany, Sunday, March 27, 2022.

{"title": "Ukrainians welcome in Hungary but Afghan student was not", "body": "When Russia launched its war in Ukraine, Hungary opened its borders for the tens of thousands of refugees escaping the violence. Other refugees have been left with no help in a field in Serbia.After studying in Hungary for three years, Hasib Qarizada sought asylum there after his native Afghanistan unraveled in chaos last August. But rather than receiving refuge, Hungarian authorities whisked Qarizada over the border six months ago into neighboring Serbia, kicking him out into a country he didn’t even know.\"Police just came over and handcuffed me,\" Qarizada told The Associated Press in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. \"They told me ‘Don’t try to run away, don’t try to fight with us, don’t do anything stupid.’\"Left all alone in a field in Serbia with no one in sight for miles, the 25-year-old Qarizada had no idea where he was, where to go or what to do.\"I was a student, and they just gave my life a totally different twist,\" he said. \"They didn’t give me a chance to grab my clothes, my (phone) charger or my laptop or anything important that I would need to travel.\"He told the AP he \"had no idea where Serbia was, what language they speak, what kind of culture they have.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3705_News_0>Hungarian police haven’t immediately responded to AP’s request for a comment on Qarizada’s expulsion in September.While Hungary is notorious for how its treats migrants fleeing wars and poverty, Qarizada’s case points to a particularly sinister practice of sending people into a third country they hadn’t come from.Rights activists in the region registered the first such case in 2017, when a 16-year-old Kurd from Iraq was deported into Serbia from Hungary though he had initially entered Hungary from Romania and managed to reach Austria before he was sent back.More recently, a woman from Cameroon who entered Hungary from Romania was sent to Serbia last December. Another African woman who flew in from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, a year ago also ended up in a field in Serbia.\"This is something that unfortunately has become normal, regular and something which cannot be considered as unusual,\" Serbian rights lawyer Nikola Kovacevic said.Qarizada’s expulsion illustrates the stark differences in the treatment of people from Ukraine and those from non-European war zones under right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3705_News_1>Similarly, Croatia – another EU country that has been accused off using violence against migrants – has said Ukrainians can come and stay.Activists have applauded the shift while also warning of discrimination against refugees and migrants from the Middle East and Africa, who for years have faced perils and pushback at the borders of Hungary, Croatia and other European nations.\"For those of us following these issues, it is hard to miss the stark contrast of the last few weeks with Europe’s harsh response to people fleeing other wars and crises,\" said Judith Sunderland of Human Rights Watch. \"A staggering number of people from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East die every year attempting to reach Europe.\"Zsolt Szekeres from the Hungarian Helsinki Committee noted that \"the (Hungarian) government is trying their best to explain now why Ukrainians are good asylum-seekers and others are bad migrants.\"With Hungary’s April 3 election approaching, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs dismissed as \"fake news\" media reports that authorities were discriminating even among the refugees arriving from Ukraine.Border pushbacks, which are illegal under international law, means that people are sent from one country to another without consideration of their individual circumstances.When, like Qarizada, they are expelled to a country they hadn’t come from, \"the severity of the violation is higher,\" said Kovacevic, the Serbian lawyer.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3705_News_2>Qarizada’s deportation was even more drastic as he hadn’t arrived in Hungary along any illegal migration route. A self-financed student who shared an apartment and had an established life in Budapest, Qarizada sought asylum because the turmoil in Afghanistan meant his family could no longer pay his university fees and therefore he couldn’t renew his residence permit.In rejecting his asylum application, activists say, Hungarian authorities disregarded the fact that Qarizada’s homeland of Afghanistan couldn’t be considered safe as the Taliban returned to power.Qarizada told the AP that his family had connections with Afghanistan’s pre-Taliban government and were in danger of retribution. \"They hardly go outside,\" he said.Helsinki Committee lawyers have taken Qarizada’s case both to the courts in Hungary and the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that his unlawful expulsion runs against the European Convention of Human Rights, Szekeres said.A Hungarian court has ruled in favor of Qarizada, but the lawyers are now waging another legal battle to force Hungarian authorities to implement the decision and allow him to come back, he added.\"He applied for asylum, he was staying here, and he was in need of protection, and he was pushed out in a summary manner,\" Szekeres insisted. \"He was never given the possibility or option to explain his situation.\"For Qarizada, the days after the expulsion were the worst of his life.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3705_News_3>Abandoned in Serbia, he walked for hours, finally reaching a gas station where a woman let him charge his phone and directed him toward the nearest asylum center. The facility was so full he slept outside for four nights.\"I felt very horrible ... because I was a normal student. I was studying, I was going to classes. I had my own friends. I had my own life,\" he said. \"I wasn’t doing anything bad.\"Karox Pishtewan, the Kurdish minor deported into Serbia in 2017 and who was granted asylum there, also told the AP that Hungarian police \"just opened the gate and told us to go.\"\"It was July and everything was green,\" he recalled. \"I was quite shocked.

{"title": "Fourth Sunday of Lent: Amid 'tragedy' of hopelessness today, still a reason to rejoice", "body": "Christians around the world celebrate the fourth Sunday of Lent on March 27, 2022.Sometimes called Laetare Sunday, this special day in the Lenten season celebrates feelings of joy amid the more somber moments of Lent. (Laetare is a Latin word that means \"to rejoice.\")Jesse Bradley, pastor of Grace Community Church in Seattle, Washington, told Fox News Digital that although feelings of hopelessness loom for many in modern society — something he termed a \"devastating tragedy\" — believers worldwide can still have hope and even truly rejoice.A recent American Psychological Association report revealed \"unprecedented levels\" of stress among Americans due to a variety of issues that include the war in Ukraine, the COVID pandemic and the challenging economy.  Yet there is still very good reason to have hope, said Bradley.  \"People around the world are still drawing near to God,\" Pastor Bradley said in an emailed message. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3710_News_0>The pastor shared three important facets of hope, even in the most dire of circumstances.In his 20s, before becoming a pastor,Bradley was a professional soccer player. After graduating from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, he played for the Highlanders Football Club in Zimbabwe and the Aberdeen Football Club in Scotland. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3710_News_1>Then, the unexpected happened. A prescribed medication to prevent malaria reached toxic levels in his system — ending his soccer career. After fighting for his life for a full year, he said it took him \"10 years to fully recover.\"However, the pain led to \"a new purpose — and passion to spread hope around the world,\" Bradley said.\"There is a hope greater than our biggest challenges. Because of God's grace, He walks us through the valley of the shadow of death.\" Easter reminds us, Bradley said, that \"God does His greatest work in the darkest times.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3710_News_2>\"Death precedes resurrection. When I felt like I had lost everything, I shifted my identity from my own performance to God's grace.\" Bradley said he realized that \"God and his love is the one part of my life that can never be taken away.\" The message of Lent, he said, \"is that we can abide with Jesus and find a security that is deeper than our grieving.\" As the death toll in Ukraine rises and heart-wrenching pictures from that war-torn country tug at our emotions, Bradley recommends turning to God’s holy word rather than giving into hopelessness. \"The Bible is a source of comfort,\" he said. He noted that Psalm 121 begins: \"I lift up my eyes to the mountains — where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.\"We can all \"become instruments of hope as we pray, give and help those in dire need,\" said Bradley. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3710_News_3>He mentioned that his own church has started a weekly prayer gathering in which participants lift up the needs of the people of Ukraine.\"Grieving is human and healthy, but we do not need to grieve without hope,\" said Bradley. \"God is close to those who are heartbroken. Jesus has living water for every thirsty soul.\"Calling God's grace an \"undeserved gift,\" he said that it is offered to all people on earth, including Ukrainians and all \"those who are weeping with them.\"  \"We must reject discouragement and passivity,\" he further noted. \"Receiving God's grace galvanizes us to bring comfort, extending that same sacrificial love we experience through Jesus.\"  The Lenten season is significant because it focuses on an event over 2,000 years ago: the crucifixion of Jesus, said Bradley.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3710_News_4>\"Christians remember the suffering of their sinless savior who sacrificed his life with an inspiring unselfishness,\" he said. \"God sent His Son to earth and demonstrated a profound love that continues to move hearts and convince minds today that we are invited into a relationship with our maker.\"The historical evidence for the death and resurrection of Jesus is \"compelling,\" according to Bradley, and has turned even hardened non-believers into people of great faith.\"Lee Strobel was a journalist who investigated the claims of Christianity as a skeptic,\" he said. \"His research led to his eventual decision to follow Jesus — and he consequently wrote books like ‘The Case for Christ.’\" \"Hope is an anchor for the soul,\" said Bradley. \"Looking back to the cross helps us persevere now,\" he added — \"and courageously move forward.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/fourth-sunday-lent-tragedy-rejoice", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3710_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A woman is shown deep in prayer in this image. \"There is a hope greater than our biggest challenges,\" said Pastor Bradley of Seattle. \"Because of God's grace, He walks us through the valley of the shadow of death.\"", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3710_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/05/484-Christians-praying.gif"}, {"caption": "Pastor Jesse Bradley fought for his life for a year after a medication mishap — then spent 10 years fully recovering, he told Fox News Digital.

{"title": "Paralyzed Ukrainian model Oksana Kononets recalls fleeing from Russian invasion: 'When will this end?'", "body": "After the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Oksana Kononets and her mother were determined to arrive in America for a special cause.Earlier this month, the 29-year-old appeared in an annual fashion show hosted by Runway of Dreams, a nonprofit that supports adaptive clothing for people with disabilities. The model was left paralyzed at age 19 after she injured her spine caused by a fall from the fifth floor. She has used a wheelchair since 2012.Kononets told Fox News Digital she was due to fly to Los Angeles on Feb. 26 for the show. But two days prior, on Feb. 24, Russia launched a full-scale attack on her home country.\"I remember how Kyiv was bombed,\" she said. \"I remember everything. Mama took our luggage and we headed to the train station. We didn’t know which direction to go. We just found a free space on the train and started to move. It was a huge crowd. But we needed to leave.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3824_News_0>Kononets and her mother embarked on a five-day journey from Ukraine’s capital. During the trip, she and many others spent 11 hours on a train to Poland for safety.\"It was very hard to bring my wheelchair to the train,\" she said. \"One part broke. We tried to do everything we could to fix it. We also didn’t know where to stay. Should we stay in Ukraine? In Warsaw? Or somewhere else in Europe? I was scared and very tired. We needed to be safe.\"\"I remember during my journey so many of us trying to leave, wondering where can we stay,\" she shared. \"There were grandmothers, 90-year-olds, with their pets. They didn’t want to leave their loved ones behind.\"After Kononets and her mother arrived in Poland, they traveled to the Netherlands. From there, they secured a flight to the U.S. with the help of a friend. And on March 5, the pair landed safely in Los Angeles.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3824_News_1>\"Throughout our journey, all we could think about was Ukraine and what was happening to my country, my people,\" she said. \"My friends stayed to serve and protect Ukraine and help as volunteers. I think of them constantly. While yes, Los Angeles surrounds me with beautiful nature, kind people and peace, I still think of my home. And I hear of friends who are killed. It’s too hard.\"Just days after landing in America, Kononets appeared on the runway. She said her goal was to raise awareness of people with disabilities who want to pursue careers in fashion. She also wanted to represent her pride for Ukraine.\"Before my accident, I worked as a makeup artist,\" she explained. \"After the trauma, I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t be without work. But when I saw a girl in a wheelchair with the same disability who was a model, I found purpose. If she could do it, why can’t I? For two years, I worried I couldn’t do anything. That I was useless. But that image helped me recover. And since 2015, I worked as a model. It has been a dream to be on a runway even before the war.\"\"When the war happened, I wanted to show, more than ever, that Ukrainian women are strong and have big dreams,\" she continued. \"I came to not only represent me but to represent what we’re capable of. I found strength in myself, and I felt support from my friends and family in this long, hard journey. But I know today that I have the power to fulfill my dream. I’m proud to be Ukrainian. It’s a huge honor. And I want to represent that.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3824_News_2>Kononets said she’s grateful for being in America. But her family remains on her mind constantly. Her father, sister and grandmother, who is 83, are still in Ukraine. The patriarch lost work after his business was bombed. \"The most important thing is that we’re alive,\" she said. \"We are thinking of our future. I’m thinking maybe here, I can try to find work in fashion as a model. That way, I can support my family. I would also like to volunteer and give back. Anything to help my family and those leaving Ukraine.\"\"Right now there is a shortage of medicine in Ukraine,\" she said. \"This is a problem for people who have asthma and [other ailments]. We need more support in the medical field. It’s very hard. Just two days ago, my father stood in the queue to buy bread. He stood for two and a half hours. The other day he couldn’t move his foot. But today, I spoke with him, and he’s doing OK. But you wonder, when will this end?\"Kononets also commended Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s efforts during the devastating conflict.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3824_News_3>\"He has done good work as a president,\" she said. \"I also think it would be good if people can come to the USA. Europe right now, it’s very full. So many people escaped Ukraine and moved to other cities. Now more than ever, we need to support each other in the world.\"Kononets said she and her mother are taking it a day at a time as they stay closely connected with their family in Ukraine. She is hopeful to find work in the fashion industry that will allow her to continue raising awareness on those with disabilities, which will also help support her loved ones back home.She remains hopeful that her country will persevere, noting that her people are \"strong.\"\"Never give up,\" said Kononets. \"You have to believe in yourself, no matter what.

{"title": "Jack Barsky: What a Russian spy's job might look like now, from one of the KGB's 'best-trained' double agents", "body": "Jack Barsky joined a pre-arranged Friday morning Zoom meeting 18 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. Wearing a navy blue, long-sleeved sweater with a white, collared shirt underneath, he appeared the everyday gentleman – an all-American father, possibly a grandfather – as he sat with his arms folded in front of a pre-set background of the Hudson River as the interview began.Barsky, now a 74-year-old author and public speaker, lives a life that appears to be that of a typical American citizen. But his life and his story are anything but typical. Barsky was born Albrecht Dittrich before he was recruited by the now-defunct KGB, which later became the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). He was trained and groomed for years before he spent a decade living a double life as a Russian spy in New York City. \"I wound up to be one of the best-trained agents they ever sent to the United States,\" he told Fox News Digital. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_0>Albrecht Dittrich was born in Germany in 1949. He was raised in a part of the country that became the German Democratic Republic – known as \"East Germany\" – a vassal state dominated by the Soviet Union. \"I grew up as a good little communist,\" Barsky told Fox News Digital. Given the Stasi’s – the secret police’s – practice of keeping records on all of East Germany’s residents, Dittrich’s good grades and allegiance to the communist party caught the attention of the KGB not long after he entered the workforce. He spent a year and a half communicating informally with recruiters before he flew to the KGB and Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin and met with the head of the security agency.\"Out of the blue, he asked me: ‘So what? Can we count on you?’\" he recalled of his meeting with the top-ranked KGB official.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_1>Dittrich was given until noontime the next day to provide a final answer. \"I thought it through, I said, it is an opportunity to help the world revolution, to free some of the suppressed folks in the Western countries to have the good life,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I said yes. I had no idea what I really signed up for.\" Five years later, he said, \"I showed up in the United States.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_2>Dittrich underwent two years of basic training before he was sent to Moscow for another two and a half years. There, the emphasis was not only on honing in on his spycraft skills, but being able to speak English so well that only a glint of an accent was evident. When his handlers determined he was ready, Dittrich said goodbye to his mother, his wife and their young child, and left behind his life in Germany. From there, he took \"a long zigzag trip through Europe with multiple forged passports\" – and varied which documents he used to prevent traceability. He entered the U.S. in Chicago and made his way to New York City, ditching the bogus passports along the way. \"In the fall of 1978, I showed up in the United States,\" he said. \"The only documentation I had was a certified copy of a birth certificate in the name of Jack Barsky.\"Dittrich took on the identity of Jack Philip Barsky, a 10-year-old boy who died in Maryland in September 1955. The mother of the original Jack Barsky bore the maiden name Schwartz, which Dittrich’s handlers preferred because of the surname’s presumed German or Jewish-German roots, Barsky said. He used it as a way to explain away any remnants of a German accent, and told anyone who questioned him he was born into a bilingual household in Orange, New Jersey.From then on, Albrecht Dittrich was someone from a past life – a life that was revisited only once every two years, when Barsky was granted a trip back home.But despite the fact that the actual Jack Barsky was not around to interfere, becoming the new Barsky \"wasn’t easy.\" \"I tried once to get one birth certificate and that failed, because the office that issued the birth certificates also cross-referenced death certificates, and I wound up asking for the copy of my birth certificate after I died,\" he recalled. His second attempt was successful, but he wasn’t yet out of the woods. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_3>He then covered himself in dirt and played the character of a farmworker, because the farm industry was exempt from Social Security requirements at the time, when he went to the Social Security office to get the necessary documentation.  \"I made myself into somebody who had just jumped off the potato truck. I rubbed soap into my eyes to make them red, I had stubble on my face, the hair wasn’t really combed well, dirty T-shirt,\" he said. \"Two weeks later, I got the Social Security card in the mail, and I was allowed to actually legally work in the United States.\"Barsky moved to New York City’s Upper East Side, but avoided almost any social interaction for about a year, until he had all his necessary documentation. His first job was working as a bike messenger, which he did for two and a half years. When he was on the road or interacting with customers – and even when he had downtime in the office – he absorbed everything. Barsky then went to college, and graduated from Baruch College as Class of 1984 valedictorian.By that point, he \"felt rather comfortable in my American skin,\" Barsky said. He took a job as a computer programmer for MetLife, working in the One Madison Avenue high-rise – all the while still secretly working for the KGB and feeding his handlers any and all information. \"That's when I finally was on my way to become middle class, in the end, the upper middle-class person, at which point I would have become a much more dangerous agent,\" he said. \"But before that happened, I quit.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_4>\"The first and foremost aspect of the mission of folks like us was just there, being in the U.S., being available,\" Barsky said. \"We were supposed to be on standby just in case,\" he added, referring to the possibility that diplomats in the U.S., most of whom were KGB spies, were kicked out of the country. He added that he was sent to the U.S. with the goal of \"collecting information about foreign policy, getting close to foreign policy decision makers or influencers.\"His handlers gave him names of people and organizations with whom they wanted him to get cozy, including the Hudson Institute, \"a conservative think tank,\" and Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security adviser under President Carter.\"That was a pipe dream,\" he said. \"I never got to a point where I was positioned in society to have a realistic explanation why I would want to befriend some of these people.\"He also wrote periodic reports about how the American public was responding to world events and tried to make as many other connections as possible. \"The other thing that was important to them was for me to get to know as many people as possible – contacts, contacts, contacts, that’s what I heard a lot. And then profile them, analyze them, send profiles to Moscow for them to determine whether they would be good candidates for recruitment.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_5>He said he was never told what happened with any of the people he reported, or if and how KGB higher-ups used the information he shared.Barsky also spoke regularly to his handlers in Moscow, and communicated with them at least weekly via radio transmissions. In New York, he and his network communicated via signals in agreed-upon spots – a detail that becomes important later in Barsky’s story – and passed information using \"dead drops,\" a process that entails leaving items or documents in an agreed-upon spot for someone else to retrieve later. He was allowed to mail two letters with \"secret writings\" to his loved ones per month, he said. Asked if he recalled any moment where he thought, \"mission accomplished,\" Barsky told Fox News Digital even developments that might seem small – getting his Social Security card, safely returning to Moscow and East Germany every two years – were seen as big steps.Getting his job at MetLife, and even his gig as a bike messenger, were seen as accomplishments. \"I had achieved probably the impossible, because there were so many situations where it was at best, 50-50 for me to actually get through and not fail,\" he said. \"But again, this was a suicidal mission, quite frankly. And the fact that I actually established myself as an American, that was my, I believe, my biggest achievement.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_6>Barsky realized he had to make a life-altering decision in December 1988, when the KGB began sending messages urging him to \"get out.\" By that point, he was married, in his mid-30s, and living in Queens with an 18-month-old daughter at home. \"There was a spot that we had arranged where agents could put some graphic signals. Very basic ... But the one that I remember the most is the red dot,\" he said. \"The spot was at a supporting pole for the elevated A-train, so as I walked up the stairs and I would look at that particular spot. There was never anything there that was just routine.\"But that changed early one Monday morning as he was on his way to work. For the first time ever, he spotted a signal: a red dot. \"That red dot meant I was in danger,\" he explained. \"It was like, ‘Emergency!’ And I did nothing. I got on a train and went to work and stared at the computer screen for all day without doing anything.\"The next message came during his regularly scheduled Thursday radio transmission. \"You got to get out. This is an emergency,\" the encrypted message stated, Barsky said. \"We have reason to believe that you're being investigated by the FBI.\"But he doubted what he was being told. Having years of experience looking over his shoulder and taking countermeasures to assure he was not being followed, he wasn’t convinced.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_7>He chose not to respond to the radio transmission, despite Moscow’s request that he confirm that he received the message and understood his instructions. They repeated the radio transmission every day, he remembered.But \"the most dramatic moment in [his] entire life\" came roughly three weeks later, as he stood on the platform of a Queens subway station, still dark outside, around 6:30 a.m. or 7 a.m. \"From my right side, this short fellow in a black trench coat, he comes really close. And then he whispers in my ear: 'You gotta come home or else you're dead.'\"He said he had a choice: to take this as a serious threat against his life, or attribute the message to \"a lack of understanding of the English language\" or an exaggeration.He had made his decision: He would leave behind his life as a spy and would stay with his wife and his budding American family.Barsky did what he could to ensure that his family in Germany was safe, and sent them one final secret writing, in which he told them that the FBI might be after him. He told them: \"I’m not coming home because I have HIV AIDS and that I may have a chance for treatment.\"He asked friends within the organization in Moscow to send his family the money he had earned through his work. They did so and ultimately told them that Dittrich had died from AIDS. His mother died in 1984, before she was able to learn the truth about her son. Barsky’s story is no secret anymore. Though it took time and years of investigation, the FBI ultimately caught up to him, according to Barsky’s own details and interviews conducted in \"The Agent,\" a podcast about his life.To put the story simply, agents ultimately overheard via wiretap Barsky admitting to his wife that he had previously worked as a KGB spy. They arrested him and confirmed that he was telling the truth and was no longer working for the KGB. They then began working with him to better understand Russia’s secrets.The Jack Barskys of today – spies sent from the Soviet Union, Russia or other similarly situated nations – are few and far between, but \"they’re still around,\" former FBI special agent Robin Dreeke told Fox News Digital. He estimated that there was only \"a handful\" of agents in the U.S. at one time. \"Jack is a great example of why there's not hundreds of them. Because they don't fulfill a huge function, and they take up a huge amount of resources and money,\" he continued. \"Basically, you're paying an employee and a lot of time and resources and money to do not a whole lot … their main role and function is to perform when an event happens that they need to activate them.\"And today’s spies rarely have the level of training that he received. Dreeke, former head of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program, worked personally with Russian \"illegals\" – spies in the U.S. illegally and outside of diplomatic cover – during his time with the FBI New York’s Russian Military Intelligence Squad from 1997 to 2005. Dreeke's unit tried to recruit Russian spies and then neutralize them to protect American interests, national security and NATO allies. Barsky’s training was \"significantly higher\" than what the general illegal spy will get, Dreeke told Fox News Digital. Jack did a lot of one-on-one training, as a matter of fact, all of his training was one on one, very in-depth. And typically, they go through schools... people in large classrooms,\" he said.In addition to his \"in-depth,\" \"thorough\" training, Barsky’s level of communication with Moscow was \"much higher than normal,\" Dreeke said. His tasks, while not significantly different from those of the other spies, were \"unusual\" in comparison. \"The tasks he was given were really high tempo, operational-type stuff that generally, the actual intelligence officers (Russian diplomats in the country legally) will get, like him conducting those dead drops … that's pretty unusual for someone that's not legal,\" said Dreeke, who has since authored several books and founded a company, People Formula. Illegal spies, Dreeke explained, are typically placed inside the country \"for times just like this.\" \"Russians put illegals inside our country during the Cold War in case whoever went to war, and all the diplomats were expelled, Russia could still collect intelligence and run their operatives inside the country because they have a network of illegals,\" he said.He added: \"So, literally what's going on in the world right now with Ukraine? That's exactly what illegals were created for: They were created to not just do penetrations of government institutions and organizations, but also to be in place in case the diplomatic corps gets expelled.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_8>Today, with the spotlight on Russia amid the ongoing invasion in Ukraine, spies still lurking in the United States are likely operating on \"high alert,\" Barsky said. Not only would they be more aware of what is happening in the country, but they would also be careful not to \"become too aggressive\" or potentially make mistakes. \"One of the tasks I had, and I was told that everybody who was operating in a foreign country was supposed to … look for any signs of the country preparing for war,\" Barsky explained. \"Guaranteed … the Russian agents in this country are on high alert … To the extent you could do more to look for signs of preparation for war, you would.\" He added that this would be the time that he would be reaching out to contacts he had made over the years, either those who were in the military or in companies that produced weapons. Dreeke noted that spies who are living undercover in the U.S. would be reporting back about what people are saying, compared to, and in addition to, what the news reports are saying, but will be looking over their shoulders along the way. \"I suspect they will not be opening new sources of information, but only going to well-established human intelligence sources of information,\" Dreeke continued. \"They are needing that information critically for policymaking – policymakers and decision makers on Russia's side. At the same time, though, they are now entirely paranoid about factions on their own side.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/russian-ukraine-spy-soviet-union-kgb-agent-trained-double-agents", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "This undated photo shows Jack Barsky with his mother when she visited him in Moscow while he was training to become a KGB agent.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/In-Moscow-subway-with-mother.jpg"}, {"caption": "A Russian KGB/Stasi helmet in front of Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, just two days ahead of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nov. 7, 2019, in Berlin, Germany.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1180805313.jpg"}, {"caption": "The gravesite for Jack Barsky, the 10-year-old boy who died in Maryland and whose identity Albrecht Dittrich ultimately assumed.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Barsky-Grave.jpg"}, {"caption": "One Madison Avenue, Manhattan, New York", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/One-Madison-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Jack Barsky (right) with his mother, center, and his KBG handler, named Sergej", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Moscow-with-Mom.jpg"}, {"caption": "This undated photo shows Jack Barsky and his colleagues at MetLife.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Me-and-the-Gang-at-Metlife.jpg"}, {"caption": "This undated photo shows Jack Barsky and his infant daughter, Chelsea.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_6", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Me-and-Newborn-Chelsea.jpg"}, {"caption": "A commuter walks on the platform of the Woodside LIRR train station in the Queens borough of New York on Monday, Aug. 3, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_7", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1230275637.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Kremlin towers in front of the Russian Foreign Ministry headquarters on March 18, 2021", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3911_News_8", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1231783171.jpg"}]}
{"title": "17-year-old Ukrainian student says if he doesn't stay in America, he'll 'die in war'", "body": "An exchange student from Ukraine who hopes to remain in the United States, where he's been since August 2021, is leaning on the support of his American teachers, his friends and the art of making music as he processes the fact that his loved ones are right now trying to escape the Russian-Ukraine war.Matthew Frantsuzhan, 17, arrived in the U.S. late last summer for an opportunity to study music in West Des Moines, Iowa.Now, after less than a year of studying music here, the teen is living with uncertainty and worry as his home — where his friends and immediate family were residing — was located near the original invasion zone.\"If I return to my hometown right now, it will not be the same city as I remember,\" Frantsuzhan told Fox News Digital. \"It's all about memories. I spent all my memories there. My friends and family may be killed at any time and I won’t have the opportunity to see them again. It’s completely terrible.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_0>\"[The] Ukrainian government — they made a law that all men from 18 to 60 years old, they’re not allowed to leave the country, and they will go and fight in the war,\" Frantsuzhan said.He said that he turns 18 in October.\"I want to stay in America,\" he vowed. \"America is my country. If I go back at all, they will send me to the war to die there, and I don’t want this to happen.\"A choir member, saxophone player and piano player, Frantsuzhan studied music in Ukraine for eight years. He attended the Zaporizhzhia Children Music School in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.Now a Valley High School senior, Frantsuzhan told Fox News Digital that it wasn’t easy securing a spot in the exchange program — a journey that began in 2019 with the help of his mother.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_1>\"There were 12,000 people who wanted to come to America, but there are actually only 37 students who are here,\" Frantsuzhan said, adding that he was ultimately chosen to be an alternate candidate. The COVID pandemic halted the program — though it was reinstated in 2021. Now, he's unable to return home since learning that Russian forces invaded Ukraine.Frantsuzhan said he was lying in bed when he found out Russian troops entered Ukraine.\"And when I received from social media all the photos and video and all the news ... I didn’t believe it,\" Frantsuzhan said of the attack. \"It was a huge, huge shock.\"Frantsuzhan, an only child, said his father Ivan was already in Dubai on business when Frantsuzhan's mother Olga reached Kyiv's Boryspil Airport — where there were attacks — in an attempt to flee Ukraine. \"She was telling me, ‘I can be killed [at] any moment and I don’t know if I’ll survive. I want you to know, ‘I love you. I will do my best to survive so I see you again,’\" he recalled his mother saying.Frantsuzhan’s mother ultimately was able to leave Ukraine. She reached Poland, then the Czech Republic —and finally met up with her husband in Dubai.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_2>Frantsuzhan’s grandmother, Galina, 67, and his great-grandmother, 92, also named Olga (like his mother), planned to stay in Ukraine even after Russia invaded.\"They will protect our home until the end,\" Frantsuzhan said of his grandmothers. \"They told us they will not move. They have spent their lives there.\" Every day, Frantsuzhan misses Ukraine — especially his family and the fresh, homemade food grown in his grandmother's garden, he said.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_3>Frantsuzhan has been able to communicate with his family via cell phone. He said his mother and father are safe, but both lost their jobs.Frantsuzhan said goodbye to all his childhood friends, many who have already left Ukraine and are now scattered all over the world.Haley Gibbons, a choir director at Valley High School and Frantsuzhan’s teacher, told Fox News Digital that Frantsuzhan is working with an immigration attorney in the hope that he might remain in the U.S. and eventually reunite with his family.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_4>\"I tell Matthew, 'You're here now. We'll be here for you, and we will do all that we can to maximize the time you have with us,'\" Gibbons said.\"He's very articulate, he's very thoughtful and [he] has a really good command of not only his voice but his own thoughts,\" she added.Gibbons and her staff have been doing what they can to allow Frantsuzhan to be a teenager and to focus on his music, which brings him joy amid the terror of war. \"Matthew is not a panicker,\" Gibbons said. \"He is a very, very strong young man, but if there's something that’s overwhelming him, [we] take deep breaths together.\"Frantsuzhan has dreams of becoming a music teacher and a show choir concert director. He hopes to attend Iowa’s Luther College, where his teacher, Gibbons, achieved her degree.Frantsuzhan said he’s grateful for the support of his friends from Ukraine who are caught up in the war.\"I was shocked when all my friends told me I’m completely right, that I should stay in America,\" Frantsuzhan said.\"America is a different country, but I like America very much,\" he added. \"It’s a completely new way of life …You can be safe here. You don’t have to worry about your financial situation, your safety [or] college.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_5>\"If you're born here, you have rights,\" Frantsuzhan said. \"You have freedom. You can do whatever you want to do.\"Frantsuzhan said he’s been looking to his teachers and friends at Valley High for support.\"Ms. Gibbons, if [she’s] on a scale from one to 10, it's going to be a 12,\" Frantsuzhan said. \"One time, she told me I was just like her. We have a wonderful relationship and I like her. I never need to be alone.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_6>Frantsuzhan said he’s thankful to always have someone to hug or talk to; he's also grateful to have his music as a distraction until he’s able to see his parents — who are trying to build a new life.Gibbons said she, her colleagues and Frantsuzhan’s immigration attorney are putting \"all energy\" into helping the teen stay in this country.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/17-yr-old-ukrainian-student-america-die-russian-ukraine-war", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Matthew Frantsuzhan, 17 (center), an exchange student from Ukraine, poses with his father Ivan, his mother Olga, his great-grandmother Olga, 92 (first row, far left) and his grandmother Galina, 67.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3912_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/new-3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Matthew Frantsuzhan, a choir member, saxophone player and piano player, is shown here with two of his music teachers.

{"title": "Ukrainian pop star details escape from war to US to use her voice: 'The war must be stopped'", "body": "Oleksandra Zaritska woke up to a phone call on Feb. 25 at 5 a.m. On the other end of the line was her mother informing her Russia's war on Ukraine had begun. From there, her \"big\" – and brave – journey from Kyiv to the United States would begin.Zaritska, also known as Sasha, is the frontwoman of the popular Ukrainian pop band Kazka. Kazka intended to celebrate their five-year anniversary together weeks ago, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine scrapped those plans.Sasha was the lone member of her band to flee Ukraine and travel to the United States to perform at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. The 29-year-old performer arrived in Austin last week admittedly in a \"bad mood\" over the state of her war-torn country, and the fact that she was without her bandmates, consisting of three females currently in Kyiv, and three men who have no choice but to stay in Ukraine to help their country.\"It was a long journey,\" Sasha told Fox News Digital in a phone interview from New York City on Tuesday. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3909_News_0>\"Long\" is an understatement. Sasha, who was born in Kharkiv –  a city that is \"now 90% destroyed,\" she said – was living at her apartment in Kyiv when the war broke out. She also has a home outside of Kyiv. On Feb. 25, Sasha, her dogs and friends traveled from her Kyiv apartment to her house, which is around 2.5 miles from the Hostomel Airport. What was normally a 30-minute car ride took \"five or six hours\" due to heavy traffic as panic set in.\"We all get to my house because we was thinking that there would be a safe place because this house is not in Kyiv. On the first day of war we were thinking the war will be only in Kyiv and in big cities. But actually my house, it was near the airport, and on the second day of war, this airport was bombed,\" she recalled.Sasha, her friends and some family members, barely slept the first five days of war.\"It was very hard because we heard big explosions, like all the time, mostly in the evening,\" Sasha said. \"My walls were shaking. Every two minutes we heard explosions. There were such huge explosions at one time that we all, from different rooms, would run into the bathroom. After this, on the sixth day, we decided to leave the house.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3909_News_1>Sasha took her three dogs, her mother, sister and a friend, and drove to the west of Ukraine. From there, she drove through Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and eventually landed in the Czech Republic. She left her loved ones in Prague – the rest of her family is still in Ukraine – and took a flight that stopped in London before ultimately arriving in Austin last week.\"They are safe, but I don’t want to say that it’s safe because I’m afraid there are no places for sure to be safe,\" Sasha said of her family still in Ukraine, including her dad, who has ammunition and a uniform to fight. \"Because the sky is open, we have a dangerous sky, so you’ll never know.\"As of Tuesday afternoon, Sasha still has no clue what's left of her house outside Kyiv. \"I don't think about this too much because it's really terrifying for me to know that in my house probably lives Russian soldiers, or maybe they burned my house already,\" she said.\"It's very hard because this is my home, my dream. I always wanted to live near the forest and I kept my own money that I earned by Kazka concerts and all of this and bought the house. Now I don't know if this house even exists. But it's OK, you know why? Because it's just a home and all of my family are safe and that's more important,\" the musician added.Although she's missing her loved ones and her country, Sasha said she decided to travel to the United States for her performance because it's a place she can continue to do what she does best: use her voice.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3909_News_2>\"I know I can't do anything in Ukraine besides be a volunteer. I have a voice and I need to use this voice, so I’m here to talk about this,\" she said of the war.On March 19, Sasha took the stage at South by Southwest for its \"Sounds From Ukraine SXSW Music Festival Showcase.\" She was the only Ukrainian musician in attendance. Fortunately, Americans provided instruments so the soloist could perform Kazka hits. Then, she was joined on stage by Charlie Sexton for a powerful performance of Bob Dylan's \"Masters of War.\"\"It was a big honor. The first few days I actually don’t want to sing at all,\" Sasha recalled of her arrival in Texas. \"Because of Ukraine, I felt so sorry about it all. But I have so much support and so many requests for the people’s favorite songs and I decided to perform.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3909_News_3>Performing \"Masters of War\" was by Sasha's design. \"It was my straight message to Putin. I got big support from Charlie Sexton. We were together on one stage, and he was playing on guitar. They have American musicians with me, these guys who really was very helpful. I was feeling not so alone in America.\"Sasha said she hopes \"Putin will see\" her performance. She called \"Masters of War\" a \"very powerful song\" in that it \"can be an anthem of war and the message to all dictators in the world.\"The Austin performance was also unique in that she got a chance to perform for a majority of Americans.\"It was like the first time I perform for Americans because when we have tour there are mostly Ukrainians there. Now, I feel a big support, really. I have no band with me, and it’s scary for me, but I felt so much support from everybody.\"Currently, in New York, Sasha said she hopes she can help bring her female bandmates to the U.S. so they can put on charity shows for Ukraine. On Wednesday, the singer had the honor of performing the National Anthem for the raising of the Ukraine and American flags in lower Manhattan. The event was attended by Mayor Eric Adams.In terms of what Americans can do to help Ukraine at this time, Sasha shared: \"The war must stop. It has to be stopped. Actually Americans can make it stop a little bit faster. They can call and write to Congress, and they can call to senators in the government to let them know you care about Ukraine. It’s really important. Also, show up to rallies and protests and use your voices to help Ukraine.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3909_News_4>Meanwhile, the Ukrainian singer said she will continue to hold onto hope for her country.\"I know we will win this war because our people stand for peace and truth. People want to be in a free country, so they will stand til the end. I really hope that the people will be alive, and it will stop as soon as possible.\"Although she did share a stark warning for other countries, including the U.S.\"Russia will not stop at Ukraine, actually. Ukraine is fighting for all of Europe and the West, and that’s why we need to help Ukraine and democracy for everyone. The war must be stopped right now, and we need to save everybody. I think we need to scream to everybody and talk with everybody.

{"title": "Russian special envoy resigns over Ukraine invasion, reportedly flees country", "body": "Russian government official Anatoly Chubais stepped down from his position in the highest-level display of opposition to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Bloomberg reported that Chubais, 66, fled the country after leaving his role in protest, but Reuters noted that it is not clear why he decided to leave the country. Chubais reportedly hung up the phone when asked to comment on the matter. His role as Special Envoy – specifically regarding climate and sustainable development – appears a small one, but he has supported and assisted Putin for decades. He first served as Deputy Prime Minister under Boris Yeltsin before transitioning to Kremlin Chief of Staff near the end of Yeltsin’s tenure. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3957_News_0><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3957_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3957_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3957_News_3>But it was his work as an economic reformer with Putin that would create a truly lasting impression on the privatization of Russia’s industries. Chubais would go on to hold a number of top-level positions at various state companies, including RAO Unified Energy System of Russia. Most importantly, Chubais maintained close ties with Western officials, much like his contemporary and former colleague, former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. Putin’s promise that Russia would \"self-cleanse\" itself of \"traitors\" may have driven Chubais to consider his stance on the war and his personal safety. His resignation follows that of Arkady Dvorkovich, who served as senior economic advisor to Dmitry Medvedev. Dvorkovich stepped down from his role as the head of a state-backed tech fund after condemning the invasion.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/ukraine-war-russian-special-envoy-protests-war-flees-country", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3957_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "FILE PHOTO: Anatoly Chubais, special representative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, attends a session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) in Saint Petersburg, Russia, June 3, 2021.

{"title": "Biden jets to Europe as 'new world order' comments reverberate", "body": "President Biden is traveling to Brussels on Wednesday to take part in a special NATO summit in Belgium and visit Poland to discuss international efforts to support Ukraine and punish Russia for its invasion.The trip comes after Biden said there will be a \"new world order\" that must be led by the United States. Departing the White House Wednesday morning, Biden was asked what he will say to European partners. \"I'm going to say it all to their face,\" Biden told reporters. \"I'll be happy to talk to you guys when I get back.\" Biden, was also asked about chemical warfare, to which he replied: \"I think it's a real threat.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_0>During the summit, Biden will \"discuss the ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies,\" the White House said. Biden, after the summit, is scheduled to join a European Council Summit to discuss \"shared concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those effected by the violence, and to address other challenges related to the conflict.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_1>Following his meetings in Brussels with NATO allies, G7 leaders and European Union Leaders, Biden will travel to Warsaw, Poland, on March 25, where he will hold a bilateral meeting with President Andrzej Duda. Biden on Friday is expected to discuss how the United States and allies are responding to the humanitarian and human rights crisis that Russia’s war on Ukraine has created.White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, last week, spoke with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Gen. Nikolay Patrushev, and called for Russia to \"stop attacking\" Ukrainian cities and towns, while warning of \"consequences\" should Russia decide to use any chemical or biological weapons on Ukraine.Sullivan's warnings about Russia's possible use of chemical weapons comes after the White House warned that Russia could use \"chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine\" or could create a \"false flag operation\" using them, after the Kremlin accused the U.S. of being involved in  research at Ukrainian labs.But Biden warned on Monday that the world is \"at an inflection point,\" one that \"occurs every three or four generations.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_2>\"As one of — as one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day, 60 — 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946,\" Biden said. \"And since then, we’ve established a liberal world order, and that hadn’t happened in a long while.\"Biden warned that now is a time \"when things are shifting.\"\"We’re going to — there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it,\" Biden said. \"And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.\"The Biden administration has voiced \"deep concerns\" about Russia’s \"alignment\" with China, as intelligence officials said that the Kremlin had turned to Beijing for economic and military aid after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.The president had a secure video call with Chinese President Xi last week for nearly two hours in which he warned of the \"consequences\" should China \"provide material support\" to Russia amid its multi-front war on Ukraine.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_3>White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who met with his Chinese counterpart in Rome, Italy, last week ahead of Biden and Xi’s meeting, said that the administration \"has not seen\" the \"provision of military equipment by China to Russia\" in the days since Biden’s meeting.\"But of course, this is something we are monitoring closely,\" Sullivan said Tuesday. \"We will continue to monitor it.\"Sullivan added that Biden \"made clear to President Xi the implications and consequences of any such provision of equipment, and they very well understand one another.\"Meanwhile, Russian troops continue to shell the strategic port city of Mariupol this week as troops remained largely stalled outside of Kyiv. Thousands of Mariupol residents escaped on Tuesday while Russia continued to bomb the city.A senior U.S. defense official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is still considering the possibility of deploying additional American troops to NATO's eastern flank in Europe. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a  ahead of the NATO and G7 summits, saying there are about 100,000 people in Mairupol in \"inhuman conditions, in a complete blockade,\" and with \"no food, no water, no medicine,\" saying they are \"under constant shelling, under constant bombing.\" \"For more than a week now we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror,\" Zelenskyy said\"We continue to work at various levels to force Russia to peace. To the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are working on the negotiations, which continue virtually every day,\" Zelenksyy continued. \"It's very difficult. Sometimes scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward.\"\"We will work, we will fight in any way we can. Till the end. Bravely and openly. At all these sites. With full energy.\"But on Tuesday, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dmitri Peskov, refused Tuesday to say Russia would not use nuclear weapons if it thought Russia could be destroyed.Peskov said the conditions were consistent with the nation's national security concept. \"If there’s a threat to the very existence of our country, it can be used in accordance with this concept,\" he stated in response to the question of whether Russia’s use of nuclear weapons could be completely ruled out, according to the Russian government-controlled news site TASS.\"Russian military doctrine envisions use of nuclear weapons in a first-use scenario if it is losing a conventional conflict. Ukraine is exactly the scenario for which this was developed,\" said Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer who specialized in Russia.\"They fear U.S. intervention in Ukraine because they fear we are conventionally superior,\" she said. \"And if they interpret our action as offensive rather than defensive, that is when the viability of Russian statehood would be threatened, in accordance with the Russian national security concept and military doctrine.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//politics/biden-europe-trip-new-world-order-comments", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "President Biden speaks with members of the press before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Wednesday, March 23, 2022, in Washington.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Joe-Biden-Europe-Trip.jpg"}, {"caption": "President Biden waves as he boards Air Force One after attending the G20 summit in Rome, Monday, Nov. 1, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/Joe-Biden-Glasgow-Climate-Summit-Flight.jpg"}, {"caption": "A military aide carries the \"President's emergency satchel,\" also known as \"the football,\" which contains nuclear launch codes, before boarding Marine One behind President Biden on the South Lawn of the White House, Wednesday, March 23, 2022, in Washington.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Joe-Biden-Europe-Trip-Suitcase.jpg"}, {"caption": "President Biden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speak while visiting a memorial to the September 11 terrorist attacks at NATO headquarters in Brussels, June 14, 2021.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_3959_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Joe-Biden-NATO-Jens-Stoltenberg.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Mariupol residents 'starving' as Russian occupation continues: 'Things are bad for my family'", "body": "Residents of Mariupol, a strategically located port city in Ukraine that Russian forces have been shelling for weeks, are \"starving\" as attacks continue. Russia's invasion of Mariupol and other key Ukrainian cities like Kyiv have forced people underground and destroyed signs of civilization, leaving people without food, water, electricity and ways to communicate with their families.Maria Smarovailo, a Mariupol native who has since left the city, told Fox News Digital that there has been \"no food for more than three weeks.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3986_News_0>\"In the first week of hostiles in the city, residents bought food in stores en masse,\" she said, according to a translation. When electricity, water and cellphone signals were cut, people began collecting snow and rainwater and looting stores that were still standing \"to get at least some food and water for children.\"She added later that Russians are not allowing humanitarian aid into the city, and \"many people do not know that volunteers are working to evacuate people\" because there is no internet or cellphone signal for residents to communicate with one another. Only those with cars are successful in helping people escape because Russian forces are not allowing buses into Mariupol's city limits, she said.Another 20-year resident of Mariupol who left recently, identifying herself only as Nadia, said \"people are starving\" and \"dying of dehydration\" in Mariupol.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3986_News_1>\"Things are bad for my family,\" she said. \"They are left without a home, without a city, sitting without food, starving … in a cold basement. There are corpses on the streets of Mariupol that are not even buried. All my friends and acquaintances were left homeless.\"She added that Russian shelling continues to hit the city \"24/7.\"\"There is no silence,\" Nadia said. \"The Russian occupiers are destroying Mariupol, shelling schools, maternity hospitals, houses.\"\"People die every day,\" she said.In their last update, Mariupol officials said March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died so far in the siege. But there are fears the toll could be much higher. Airstrikes over the past week devastated a theater and an art school where many civilians were taking shelter.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3986_News_2>The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded about 1,000 civilian casualties total in Ukraine as of Wednesday.Smarovailo said that while there are still \"a lot of people left in the city,\" the deceased are trapped \"under rubble\" that cannot be cleared in order \"to save them.\"\"There is no green corridor,\" she said of humanitarian corridors that Russian forces initially agreed to execute earlier this month but have not honored since, according to local officials. \"People, at their own risk, leave the city limits under fire. Not all succeed.\"Smarovailo described the current state of childhood home as a \"huge humanitarian catastrophe.\"\"The city [has become] a ghost, where civilians are now burying people in yards and houses,\" she said. There is nothing to put out house fires with \"because there is almost no water.\" <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_3986_News_3>No \"whole\" buildings or houses stand, she said, in what had once been a \"very beautiful city with beautiful people, sea views, [attractions], concerts and renovated parks.\"\"Now there is nothing left of it,\" Smarovailo said.A U.S. defense official said Wednesday that Russia has ships stationed in the Sea of Azov that are firing upon Mariupol.More than 3.1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, and 13 million people have been affected by the war, according to the U.N.

{"title": "Inside the brutal, terrifying Russian siege of Mariupol", "body": "Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that was home to more than 400,000 people just a month ago, has been surrounded by advancing Russian forces. Situated in southeast Ukraine, Mariupol is the second-largest city in the Donetsk Oblast region. While internationally recognized as in Ukraine, it is claimed by the Russia-backed, separatist Donetsk People's Republic. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that Ukraine would never bow to ultimatums from Russia after Russia called on Ukrainian forces on Sunday to lay down arms in the city of Mariupol. After Ukraine's refusal to surrender Mariupol, Russian forces began bombing the city on March 16th. Thousands of civilians are stuck in Mariupol and have been without electricity, water, and heat for more than a week. Mstyslav Chernov is a video journalist for The Associated Press. The following account, first published by the AP, is his firsthand experience of the siege of Mariupol. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_0>The Russians were hunting us down. They had a list of names, including ours, and they were closing in.We were the only international journalists left in the Ukrainian city, and we had been documenting its siege by Russian troops for more than two weeks. We were reporting inside the hospital when gunmen began stalking the corridors. Surgeons gave us white scrubs to wear as camouflage.Suddenly at dawn, a dozen soldiers burst in: \"Where are the journalists, for f***’s sake?\"I looked at their armbands, blue for Ukraine, and tried to calculate the odds that they were Russians in disguise. I stepped forward to identify myself. \"We’re here to get you out,\" they said.The walls of the surgery shook from artillery and machine gun fire outside, and it seemed safer to stay inside. But the Ukrainian soldiers were under orders to take us with them.We ran into the street, abandoning the doctors who had sheltered us, the pregnant women who had been shelled and the people who slept in the hallways because they had nowhere else to go. I felt terrible leaving them all behind.Nine minutes, maybe 10, an eternity through roads and bombed-out apartment buildings. As shells crashed nearby, we dropped to the ground. Time was measured from one shell to the next, our bodies tense and breath held. Shockwave after shockwave jolted my chest, and my hands went cold.We reached an entryway, and armored cars whisked us to a darkened basement. Only then did we learn from a policeman why the Ukrainians had risked the lives of soldiers to extract us from the hospital.\"If they catch you, they will get you on camera, and they will make you say that everything you filmed is a lie,\" he said. \"All your efforts and everything you have done in Mariupol will be in vain.\" The officer, who had once begged us to show the world his dying city, now pleaded with us to go. He nudged us toward the thousands of battered cars preparing to leave Mariupol.It was March 15. We had no idea if we would make it out alive.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_1>As a teenager growing up in Ukraine in the city of Kharkiv, just 20 miles from the Russian border, I learned how to handle a gun as part of the school curriculum. It seemed pointless. Ukraine, I reasoned, was surrounded by friends.I have since covered wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh, trying to show the world the devastation first-hand. But when the Americans and then the Europeans evacuated their embassy staffs from the city of Kyiv this winter, and when I pored over maps of the Russian troop build-up just across from my hometown, my only thought was, \"My poor country.\"In the first few days of the war, the Russians bombed the enormous Freedom Square in Kharkiv, where I had hung out until my 20s.I knew Russian forces would see the eastern port city of Mariupol as a strategic prize because of its location on the Sea of Azov. So on the evening of Feb. 23, I headed there with my long-time colleague Evgeniy Maloletka, a Ukrainian photographer for The Associated Press, in his white Volkswagen van.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_2>On the way, we started worrying about spare tires, and found online a man nearby willing to sell to us in the middle of the night. We explained to him and to a cashier at the all-night grocery store that we were preparing for war. They looked at us like we were crazy.We pulled into Mariupol at 3:30 a.m. The war started an hour later.About a quarter of Mariupol’s 430,000 residents left in those first days, while they still could. But few people believed a war was coming, and by the time most realized their mistake, it was too late.One bomb at a time, the Russians cut electricity, water, food supplies and finally, crucially, the cell phone, radio and television towers. The few other journalists in the city got out before the last connections were gone and a full blockade settled in.The absence of information in a blockade accomplishes two goals.Chaos is the first. People don’t know what’s going on, and they panic. At first, I couldn’t understand why Mariupol fell apart so quickly. Now I know it was because of the lack of communication.Impunity is the second goal. With no information coming out of a city, no pictures of demolished buildings and dying children, the Russian forces could do whatever they wanted. If not for us, there would be nothing.That’s why we took such risks being able to send the world what we saw, and that’s what made Russia angry enough to hunt us down.I have never, ever felt that breaking the silence was so important.The deaths came fast. On Feb. 27, we watched as a doctor tried to save a little girl hit by shrapnel. She died.A second child died, then a third. Ambulances stopped picking up the wounded because people couldn’t call them without a signal, and they couldn’t navigate the bombed-out streets.The doctors pleaded with us to film families bringing in their own dead and wounded, and let us use their dwindling generator power for our cameras. No one knows what’s going on in our city, they said.Shelling hit the hospital and the houses around. It shattered the windows of our van, blew a hole into its side and punctured a tire. Sometimes we would run out to film a burning house and then run back amid the explosions.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_3><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_4><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_5>There was still one place in the city to get a steady connection, outside a looted grocery store on Budivel’nykiv Avenue. Once a day, we drove there and crouched beneath the stairs to upload photos and video to the world. The stairs wouldn’t have done much to protect us, but it felt safer than being out in the open.The signal vanished by March 3. We tried to send our video from the 7th-floor windows of the hospital. It was from there that we saw the last shreds of the solid middle-class city of Mariupol come apart.The Port City superstore was being looted, and we headed that way through artillery and machine gunfire. Dozens of people ran and pushed shopping carts loaded with electronics, food, clothes.A shell exploded on the roof of the store, throwing me to the ground outside. I tensed, awaiting a second hit, and cursed myself a hundred times because my camera wasn’t on to record it.And there it was, another shell hitting the apartment building next to me with a terrible whoosh. I shrank behind a corner for cover.A teenager passed by rolling an office chair loaded with electronics, boxes tumbling off the sides. \"My friends were there and the shell hit 10 meters from us,\" he told me. \"I have no idea what happened to them.\"We raced back to the hospital. Within 20 minutes, the injured came in, some of them scooped into shopping carts.For several days, the only link we had to the outside world was through a satellite phone. And the only spot where that phone worked was out in the open, right next to a shell crater. I would sit down, make myself small and try to catch the connection.Everybody was asking, please tell us when the war will be over. I had no answer.Every single day, there would be a rumor that the Ukrainian army was going to come to break through the siege. But no one came.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_6>By this time I had witnessed deaths at the hospital, corpses in the streets, dozens of bodies shoved into a mass grave. I had seen so much death that I was filming almost without taking it in.On March 9, twin airstrikes shredded the plastic taped over our van’s windows. I saw the fireball just a heartbeat before pain pierced my inner ear, my skin, my face.We watched smoke rise from a maternity hospital. When we arrived, emergency workers were still pulling bloodied pregnant women from the ruins.Our batteries were almost out of juice, and we had no connection to send the images. Curfew was minutes away. A police officer overheard us talking about how to get news of the hospital bombing out.\"This will change the course of the war,\" he said. He took us to a power source and an internet connection.We had recorded so many dead people and dead children, an endless line. I didn’t understand why he thought still more deaths could change anything.I was wrong.In the dark, we sent the images by lining up three mobile phones with the video file split into three parts to speed the process up. It took hours, well beyond curfew. The shelling continued, but the officers assigned to escort us through the city waited patiently.Then our link to the world outside Mariupol was again severed.We went back to an empty hotel basement with an aquarium now filled with dead goldfish. In our isolation, we knew nothing about a growing Russian disinformation campaign to discredit our work.The Russian Embassy in London put out two tweets calling the AP photos fake and claiming a pregnant woman was an actress. The Russian ambassador held up copies of the photos at a U.N. Security Council meeting and repeated lies about the attack on the maternity hospital.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_7><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_8>In the meantime, in Mariupol, we were inundated with people asking us for the latest news from the war. So many people came to me and said, please film me so my family outside the city will know I’m alive.By this time, no Ukrainian radio or TV signal was working in Mariupol. The only radio you could catch broadcast twisted Russian lies — that Ukrainians were holding Mariupol hostage, shooting at buildings, developing chemical weapons. The propaganda was so strong that some people we talked to believed it despite the evidence of their own eyes.The message was constantly repeated, in Soviet style: Mariupol is surrounded. Surrender your weapons.On March 11, in a brief call without details, our editor asked if we could find the women who survived the maternity hospital airstrike to prove their existence. I realized the footage must have been powerful enough to provoke a response from the Russian government.We found them at a hospital on the front line, some with babies and others in labor. We also learned that one woman had lost her baby and then her own life.We went up to the 7th floor to send the video from the tenuous Internet link. From there, I watched as tank after tank rolled up alongside the hospital compound, each marked with the letter Z that had become the Russian emblem for the war.We were surrounded: Dozens of doctors, hundreds of patients, and us.The Ukrainian soldiers who had been protecting the hospital had vanished. And the path to our van, with our food, water and equipment, was covered by a Russian sniper who had already struck a medic venturing outside.Hours passed in darkness, as we listened to the explosions outside. That’s when the soldiers came to get us, shouting in Ukrainian.It didn’t feel like a rescue. It felt like we were just being moved from one danger to another. By this time, nowhere in Mariupol was safe, and there was no relief. You could die at any moment.I felt amazingly grateful to the soldiers, but also numb. And ashamed that I was leaving.We crammed into a Hyundai with a family of three and pulled into a 5-kilometer-long traffic jam out of the city. Around 30,000 people made it out of Mariupol that day — so many that Russian soldiers had no time to look closely into cars with windows covered with flapping bits of plastic.People were nervous. They were fighting, screaming at each other. Every minute there was an airplane or airstrike. The ground shook.We crossed 15 Russian checkpoints. At each, the mother sitting in the front of our car would pray furiously, loud enough for us to hear.As we drove through them — the third, the tenth, the 15th, all manned with soldiers with heavy weapons — my hopes that Mariupol was going to survive were fading. I understood that just to reach the city, the Ukrainian army would have to break through so much ground. And it wasn’t going to happen.At sunset, we came to a bridge destroyed by the Ukrainians to stop the Russian advance. A Red Cross convoy of about 20 cars was stuck there already. We all turned off the road together into fields and back lanes.The guards at checkpoint No. 15 spoke Russian in the rough accent of the Caucasus. They ordered the whole convoy to cut the headlights to conceal the arms and equipment parked on the roadside. I could barely make out the white Z painted on the vehicles.As we pulled up to the sixteenth checkpoint, we heard voices. Ukrainian voices. I felt an overwhelming relief. The mother in the front of the car burst into tears. We were out.We were the last journalists in Mariupol. Now there are none.We are still flooded by messages from people wanting to learn the fate of loved ones we photographed and filmed. They write to us desperately and intimately, as though we are not strangers, as though we can help them.When a Russian airstrike hit a theater where hundreds of people had taken shelter late last week, I could pinpoint exactly where we should go to learn about survivors, to hear firsthand what it was like to be trapped for endless hours beneath piles of rubble. I know that building and the destroyed homes around it. I know people who are trapped underneath it.And on Sunday, Ukrainian authorities said Russia had bombed an art school with about 400 people in it in Mariupol.But we can no longer get there.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/20-days-mariupal-team-documented-tragedy", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Associated Press photographer Evgeniy Maloletka helps a paramedic to transport a woman injured during shelling in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine, March 2, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4049_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/ec21b81a-1.jpeg"}, {"caption": "Associated Press videographer Mstyslav Chernov walks amid smoke rising from an air defense base in the aftermath of a Russian strike in Mariupol, Ukraine, Feb. 24, 2022.

The IOM also estimates that nearly 6.5 million people have been displaced in Ukraine due to the war.Russia-Ukraine refugees are scattered all throughout Europe, especially within neighboring countries. Italy has stepped up, however, with a plan to take in 175,000 Ukrainian refugees, according to Reuters.The news agency reports that 27,000 Ukrainian women and 21,600 Ukrainian children have already arrived in Italy, per interior ministry data.It’s not immediately clear if there are refugees in Parabiago.Despite this, baker Cunsolo told the Associated Press he believes \"in trying to help others in any way you can.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4063_News_7>That sentiment appears to be shared all around the globe as business owners and private citizens find ways to raise money for humanitarian aid.

{"title": "Hollywood stars who once met with Putin 'pray' Russian president ends Ukraine war", "body": "As the Russia-Ukraine war continues, many industries have sanctioned Russia, including Hollywood. Although Russia isn’t a leading market for Hollywood, it was one of the top six box office markets worldwide in revenue in 2021, according to Statista. And over the years, celebs have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin while visiting the country for events, like professional fights and concerts. Here’s a look at some celebs who either once hobnobbed or briefly met with Putin.In an interview with Fox News Digital, Mickey Rourke recalled meeting Putin when Rourke had a \"professional fight four years ago\" in Russia.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4112_News_0>\"I had the time of my life,\" Rourke told Fox News Digital about visiting the country. \"The people couldn't have been nicer, more polite, more respectful. I actually went with Putin. He took us to a very famous museum in St. Petersburg.\"Rourke said he also visited a children's cancer hospital. \"And we went in there and visited the really, really sick, little, tiny, tiny kids,\" Rourke recalled. \"And, you know, I looked over at him and I saw him and — nobody's going to want to hear this — but I saw a man with empathy and who was really moved by what these children are going through.\"Now Rourke, who once wore a shirt with Putin's face on it and reportedly spoke kindly about him at the time, feels differently, calling what's happening in Ukraine a \"nightmare kind of scenario.\"\"Then now there's this whole other thing that's happening,\" the former boxer said, noting that he prays to God that Putin will end the war.\"When I pray at night, I pray, 'Please God, … let him find something inside his soul to just say, 'Okay, that's it,''\" Rourke said.Leonardo DiCaprio was once photographed alongside Putin after the two attended the International Tiger Conservation Forum at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in 2010.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4112_News_1>In the wake of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, DiCaprio donated to humanitarian groups CARE, International Rescue Committee, the United Nation's High Commissioner for Refugees and Save the Children in support of Ukraine, a person close to DiCaprio said. However, no dollar amounts were provided.The actor further shared resources Friday on his personal Instagram account.\"The victims of warfare in Ukraine have lost everything from their loved ones to basic materials for survival,\" he wrote, alongside photos from Ukraine. \"Humanitarian organizations like @SavetheChildren @careorg @rescueorg and @refugees are on the ground, dedicating their personnel and resources to support families and innocent people.\"Film director Oliver Stone, who previously worked with the Russian president for the documentary \"The Putin Interviews,\" told KCRW’s Robert Scheer in early February that the United States media had \"no proof\" that Russia intended to invade Ukraine.Stone was proven wrong when Putin launched his attack on Feb. 24, and Stone subsequently made a statement condemning Russia's \"aggression.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4112_News_2>\"Although the United States has many wars of aggression on its conscience, it doesn’t justify Mr. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. A dozen wrongs don’t make a right. Russia was wrong to invade,\" Stone said.Gerard Depardieu, a reported friend of Putin, has taken a stance against the Russia-Ukraine war. The French actor became a Russian citizen in 2013 to avoid taxes, according to The New York Times. In a letter to Russian state television he wrote, \"I love your president, Vladimir Putin, very much, and it’s mutual.\"Before Putin launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine, Depardieu went on French television to say, \"Leave Vladimir alone.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4112_News_3>Once the war began, the French actor denounced it but didn't call out Putin specifically.\"Russia and Ukraine have always been brother countries,\" Depardieu said during an interview with Agence France-Presse. \"I am against this fratricidal war,\" he added. \"I say, ‘Stop the weapons and negotiate.’\"Steven Seagal was granted Russian citizenship in 2016 and, prior to the war, had publicly praised Putin.The 69-year-old American actor once called Putin \"one of the world’s greatest living leaders\" but has since tempered his support for the Russian president.\"I look at Russia and Ukraine as one family and really believe it is an outside entity spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other,\" he told Fox News Digital.\"My prayers are that both countries will come to a positive, peaceful resolution where we can live and thrive together in peace,\" Seagal added.Paul McCartney met with Putin at the Kremlin May 24, 2003, in Moscow as he prepared for a concert on Red Square. The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted the Beatles star to share a photo of himself performing in Kyiv in 2008.\"Remembering playing for our friends in Ukraine in Independence Square in 2008 and thinking of them in these difficult times,\" the musician shared on his official website. \"We send our love and support.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4112_News_4>McCartney also shared links to resources providing support to Ukraine.Although there are no photos of Putin and Jane Fonda together, the actress previously claimed that the now-Russian president was once her tour guide.\"This guy,\" Fonda said during a 2020 interview with Andy Cohen as she pointed to Putin on a screen, \"was our travel guide. When I was married to Ted Turner, and he was going to do his Goodwill Games in Leningrad.\"We landed at the airport, and the person who picked us up, and drove us around, was Vladimir Putin. He was the travel guide. He was like our interpreter at the time.\"The actress recalled a moment during the trip when Putin refused to go meet his wife at the hospital.\"His wife had gotten sick, and she was heading to the hospital,\" Fonda said. \"He told us that in the car and Ted said, 'You have to go to the hospital. You have to go to the hospital to check on your wife,' and he wouldn't. Vladimir Putin wouldn't do it. He stayed with us.\"She has not publicly commented on the Russia-Ukraine war.Fonda previously received backlash for posing with an anti-aircraft gun in Hanoi, Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. The actress was nicknamed \"Hanoi Jane\" and accused of treason.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4112_News_5>\"I am proud I went to Vietnam when I did,\" she said during the Television Critics Associations Summer Press Tour in 2018. \"I am so sorry that I was thoughtless enough to sit down on that gun at that time and the message that that sends to the guys who were there and their families. It’s just horrible for me to think of that.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//entertainment/hollywood-russia-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4112_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Mickey Rourke recalled meeting Putin when Rourke had a \"professional fight four years ago\" in Russia.

{"title": "'Stranger Things' star, a US Navy veteran, expresses 'shock' over Russia-Ukraine war: 'The terror is palpable'", "body": "\"Stranger Things\" actress Jennifer Marshall has a special message to share with Ukrainian citizens, including refugees in search of safety and those who have remained, determined to fight.Marshall, a fifth-generation military veteran, told Fox News Digital in an interview this week that, like most, she's been following Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"with shock, disbelief, anger and tremendous sadness.\"\"Innocent men, women and children are being killed. Their homeland is being taken from them,\" Marshall said. \"They are suffering incredibly and feeling a sense of hopelessness that I’m sure is overwhelming. I struggle with sending a message because this is a time where words simply aren’t enough.\"If I had to say something to the Ukrainians it would be that the world is watching. The world stands with you. Stay strong and keep fighting for your country and for your families.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_0>, in an address to Congress on Wednesday, pleaded with the United States to \"do more\" by implementing a no-fly zone, providing additional aircraft and air defense systems and creating a new security alliance.The president of Ukraine has been hailed as a hero for his bravery in joining the fight against Russia. He's also been commended for his ability to connect with leaders around the world. Marshall agreed with those who have commended the former actor, sharing that she believes he's \"leading by example.\"\"And the importance of that cannot be understated,\" Marshall said. \"His actions are clearly inspiring many Ukrainians to fight as well, even if they have no prior military or combat experience.\"Marshall, who \"Stranger Things\" fans will recognize as playing the role of Max's mom on the popular sci-fi series, has prior military experience herself. Before becoming a familiar face on camera, she enlisted in the U.S. Navy at age 17 and left for boot camp six weeks after graduating from high school. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_1>\"My rank was E-5, or Second Class Petty Officer. During my five years of service, I worked on the tarmac, in aviation logistics, was on the ship's security defense team and the repair locker fire team (firefighting and damage control). Definitely a variety of jobs and experiences, which I am thankful for,\" she said.Marshall said she knew \"from the time I was a little girl\" that she wanted to serve her country. \"I come from a long line of patriots who have served this great nation — a fifth-generation veteran. Living in a tiny, one stoplight town in Colorado made me even more adamant about joining. I wanted to serve my country, improve myself and travel. The military provided opportunities for all three.\"Despite serving in the military, Marshall stressed the war overseas is like nothing she's ever experienced firsthand.\"Even though I served in the military, in my lifetime we have never faced an invasion here. We have never seen foreign forces advance on our land, bomb our neighborhoods, force our family members to flee and become refugees. The terror is palpable for Ukrainians. Stay the course for you are doing what is right,\" she said in a message to Ukrainians who have stayed to fight.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_2>\"As for the Ukrainians who have fled or who are not fighting in the conflict, if you have technology available, use it. Photos, recordings, videos. Social media is often a thorn in our society, filled with drama and negativity. But during times like this, impactful images can spread like wildfire and advance the cause by influencing those in power to take action,\" she shared.The star applauded all the heroes of Ukraine.\"Some of the most inspiring photos to come out during the invasion have been of everyday men and women picking up arms in defense of their families and their nation,\" Marshall said. \"I commend them for their heart and their courage. My advice to these heroic Ukrainians is to not underestimate yourselves. You are stronger and braver than you ever thought possible. The world stands with you and the world commends you.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_3>Marshall, who also stars in the CW's \"Mysteries Decoded,\" is inspired by other stars who have used their public platforms to lend support and raise donations for Ukrainians. Specifically, she pointed to Ukrainian native Mila Kunis' efforts. As of March 11, Kunis and husband Ashton Kutcher had raised over $20 million. Marshall called the milestone \"amazing.\"\"Other celebrities with ties to Ukraine have done an incredible job using their fame to bring awareness to what’s happening. Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds matched $1 million in donations for the U.N. Refugee Agency. There is movement being made, and I would urge those with money and power to use their fame and millions for something truly meaningful,\" she added.In addition to serving in the military, Marshall is still active in organizations assisting veterans. She is an ambassador for the award-winning nonprofit Pin-Ups for Vets, which funds various veteran and troop initiatives. She's also a mentor and visits wounded or ill veterans in hospitals and nursing homes.\"Volunteering gives me the sense of camaraderie and service that I missed when I left the military,\" Marshall said. \"When COVID hit and we weren’t able to do our visits, it hurt deeply. Pin-Ups for Vets provides an opportunity to engage with an often neglected part of our veteran community, and I loved spending time with the vets we met through our regular visits.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_4>In terms of what can still be done as the conflict continues to escalate overseas, the veteran asked that Americans continue to use the power of social media to shine a light on what's happening in Ukraine. She also implored the public to reach out to representatives in Congress to voice their concerns.\"It’s important to note that Putin’s invasion is not supported by many Russians, including those in the United States,\" she said, adding that when U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., advocated for kicking Russian students out of the United States, \"rhetoric like that is harmful and divisive and does nothing to help solve the issue abroad.\"Ultimately, her hope is that Russia's invasion ends immediately.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_5>\"I want the invasion to end, and end now. Too many innocent people have been killed and hurt. A maternity hospital bombed, over a dozen children killed, innocent civilians slaughtered. A cluster bomb reportedly fell on a preschool. Putin is a war criminal, and I support measures to hold him accountable for the crimes he has committed. This isn’t a Ukrainian-Russian ‘conflict,’ it’s a violent invasion of a sovereign country.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//entertainment/stranger-things-us-navy-veteran-russia-ukraine-war", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "During her time in the Navy, Jennifer Marshall worked as an aircraft handler, forklift operator and logistics specialist and also worked on the ships' aft repair locker fire team and security defense force.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Jennifer-Marshall-Navy-Photo-Summer-White-Uniform.jpg"}, {"caption": "This photo shows Jennifer Marshall (left) volunteering in February 2017 for Pin-Ups for Vets.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Marshall-Val-US-Marine-Lancaster-Vets-Home-Feb-2017.jpg"}, {"caption": "Through fundraisers and the sale of pinup calendars, Pin-ups for Vets has raised over $55,000 to fund various veteran and troop initiatives.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/marshall-LA-VA-Visit-July-2018.jpg"}, {"caption": "The \"Stranger Things\" star served in the U.S. Navy from age 17 to 22.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Marshall-and-Alvarez.jpg"}, {"caption": "Jennifer Marshall and Stephanie Bingham, pictured left to right, on \"Mysteries Decoded.\" In addition to her work as an actress, Marshall has her own private investigation company.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Marshall-Mysteries-Decoded-Lizzie-Borden-Episode.jpg"}, {"caption": "Jennifer Marshall is known as portraying Max's mom on Netflix's hit, \"Stranger Things.\"", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4326_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Jennifer-Marshall-Stranger-Things-S2E9.jpg"}]}

When she reunited with her family this past Monday, Afanasieva said it was the first time she'd seen them in three years.That's because the coronavirus pandemic over the past two years prevented her from traveling to Ukraine. \"I’m really happy, first of all that they’re safe,\" Afanasieva said. \"And finally we were able to see each other. It’s been a long time.\"Afanasieva runs Laika Cheesecake and Espresso, a bakery she opened in San Antonio in December 2020. Right after Russia invaded Ukraine, Afanasieva announced on Facebook that her shop would donate all of its sales from Friday, Feb. 25, to Sunday, Feb. 27, to help the Ukrainian army. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4328_News_2>Afanasieva told Fox News Digital that the idea for the fundraiser \"came very naturally.\"\"This is the least we can do,\" she said.In another Facebook post after the fundraiser, the bakery announced it had sold more than 4,500 pieces of cheesecake and that some 3,000 people had visited the bakery over the weekend.Many people waited up to three-and-a-half hours to purchase items and make donations.Even after the bakery was sold out for \"hours,\" people still waited in line to donate, the post said. Afanasieva told Fox News Digital that she didn’t expect the community to respond in such a huge way. \"It seemed like the whole city showed up,\" she said. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4328_News_3>\"We obviously didn’t expect anything like that. I thought it might get a little bit busier than usual, but then suddenly, we get to the shop on Friday and there’s a line outside the door — around the whole block, basically,\" she said.Afanasieva told Fox News Digital that Laika is still accepting donations to help the Ukrainian army and that so far, the bakery has raised about $150,000.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4328_News_4>\"The amount is increasing every day,\" Afanasieva said. \"We literally receive checks in the mailbox and even cash. People are sending cash from all over the states.\"She added, \"We were really surprised to discover so many people were actually willing to help.\" Afanasieva said she's \"really grateful\" to the San Antonio community. \"We didn’t expect that much reaction from the American people,\" she said. Afanasieva is planning to use the money to buy supplies for the Ukrainian army and get them to Ukraine, though the planning and logistics are challenging, she said.Today, more than two weeks after the fundraiser, Afanasieva said business is booming for Laika Cheesecakes and Espresso. \"We’re still selling out every day by 3 o’clock,\" Afanasieva said. \"Normally we open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4328_News_5>Though it’s been difficult for her to follow the news about the attacks on her native land, Afanasieva said she’s also experiencing pride in her country for \"probably the first time in my life,\" she said.  \"I’m really proud to be a Ukrainian,\" Afanasieva said. \"I’m really happy to be a part of this country.\" (She is a permanent resident of the U.S.)  \"I really hope all of that will be over soon for my people, for my country,\" she added.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/ukrainian-baker-country-family-russia-ukraine-war", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4328_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Anna Afanasieva, left, opened Laika Cheesecakes and Espresso in San Antonio, Texas, in December 2020.

{"title": "Iran releases 2 British citizens after striking deal", "body": "Two British citizens who had been jailed in Iran for more than five years – charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and retired civil engineer Anoosheh Ashoori – returned home to their families’ hugs and tears Thursday after the U.K. settled a decades-old debt to Iran.Zaghari-Ratcliffe hugged her 7-year-old daughter, and her husband and members of Ashoori’s family tearfully embraced one another after the two arrived via a government-chartered aircraft at the Brize Norton air base in Oxfordshire in the early morning hours.The British government said a third detainee, Morad Tahbaz, who holds U.S., British and Iranian citizenship, was released from prison on furlough as part of the same deal.The breakthrough was reached as world leaders try to negotiate the return of both Iran and the U.S. to an international agreement designed to limit Tehran’s nuclear enrichment program – talks that have been complicated by the prisoner issue. Negotiators have edged closer to a roadmap for restoring the accord, though recent Russian demands slowed progress.\"Looking forward to a new life,″ said Richard Ratcliffe, who had worked tirelessly for his wife’s release. \"You can’t get back the time that’s gone. That’s a fact. But we live in the future.″<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4413_News_0>The release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori came as the U.S., Britain and other countries seek to secure the release of dozens of dual nationals detained by Iran, which doesn’t recognize their right to hold citizenship in another country. Family members and human rights activists accuse Iran of arresting the dual nationals on trumped-up charges to squeeze concessions out of Western nations.British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told lawmakers that the change of government in Iran last summer had been instrumental in moving the talks forward. President Ebrahim Raisi is a hard-line protégé of Iran’s supreme leader known for his hostility to the West.\"I was able … to reset the relationship, to be clear that we were serious about resolving the outstanding issues that Iran had, and they were clear they were serious about resolving the outstanding issues we had,\" Truss said in the House of Commons.Extensive diplomacy secured the release of the dual nationals and led to agreement to repay the debt in a way that complies with U.K. and international sanctions. Britain agreed to pay Iran 393.8 million pounds ($515.5 million), which can only be used for humanitarian purposes. The British government declined to offer details of the arrangement.While the British government has refused to acknowledge a link between the debt and the detention of the dual nationals, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband has been outspoken in arguing that Iran was holding her hostage to force Britain to pay.The debt has been a sticking point in British-Iranian relations for more than 40 years.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4413_News_1>After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the U.K. canceled an agreement with the late shah of Iran to sell the country more than 1,500 Chieftain tanks. Since the shah’s government had paid in advance, the new Iranian government demanded repayment for the tanks that were never delivered. The two countries have haggled over the debt ever since.Hope for a deal had been growing since Tuesday, when the member of Parliament who represents Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s neighborhood in London announced that Iranian authorities had returned her passport.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken into custody at Tehran’s airport in April 2016 as she was returning home to Britain after visiting family in Iran. She was employed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news agency, but she was on vacation at the time of her arrest.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison after she was convicted of plotting the overthrow of Iran’s government, a charge that she, her supporters and rights groups deny. She had been under house arrest at her parents’ home in Tehran for the last two years.Antonio Zappulla, CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said his organization was \"overjoyed\" that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been freed.\"No one can begin to imagine what Nazanin has endured throughout the past tortuous six years; denied her freedoms, separated from her husband and young child, battling significant illness, thrown in solitary confinement,\" Zappulla said in a statement. \"An innocent victim of an international dispute, Nazanin has been one of many used as political pawns. Her treatment has been utterly inhumane.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4413_News_2>Ashoori was detained in Tehran in August 2017. He had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for alleged ties to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, something long denied by his supporters and family.Tahbaz, a British-American conservationist of Iranian descent, was caught in a dragnet targeting environmental activists while visiting Iran in January 2018. The 66-year-old served on the board of the Persian Heritage Wildlife Association, a prominent conservation group in Iran.Iran convicted Tahbaz, along with seven other environmentalists, including his colleagues, on charges of spying for the U.S. He was sentenced to 10 years and taken to Evin Prison.Truss tweeted she was delighted with the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori and said the British government would continue to work for Tahbaz’s freedom. \"Pleased Morad Tahbaz has been released on furlough and is reunited with his family in Iran, but this is far from sufficient. We will continue to work intensively to secure his departure from Iran,\" she tweeted.In France, the family of a French tourist jailed in Iran since May 2020 welcomed the release and urged French authorities to accomplish \"without delay\" what British authorities achieved.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4413_News_3>Benjamin Brière was arrested after taking pictures in a desert area where photography is prohibited, and asking questions on social media about Iran’s obligatory Islamic headscarf for women. He was sentenced to eight years in prison on what his lawyer said are trumped-up espionage and propaganda charges. He started a hunger strike in December.Wednesday’s release comes as negotiators in Vienna say they have nearly finalized a roadmap for both the U.S. and Iran to rejoin Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018, sparking years of tensions across the wider Mideast as the Islamic Republic enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.Those negotiations were disrupted last week by a Russian demand that Moscow not be affected by Western sanctions over its war on Ukraine.

{"title": "Ukraine boy's adoption stalls amid Russia's attacks: 'It's my kid,' Alabama man says", "body": "An Alabama doctor who has been wanting to adopt a boy from Ukraine has been unable to get the child out of the country during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Christopher Jahraus, 49, a radiation oncologist from Chelsea, Alabama, and his wife have been trying to get 9-year-old Sashko out of Ukraine so the child can receive needed medical treatment in safety. It's a story that Fox News Digital reported on earlier, a few weeks ago; Fox News Channel covered it as well.  However, last Friday, Jahraus was told by government officials that Sashko could not be evacuated.  \"It’s an utter roller coaster,\" Jahraus told Fox News Digital. \"It’s emotionally exhausting for all of us.\"Ukraine has stopped allowing international adoptions because of the ongoing war, but Jahraus has been trying to host Sashko temporarily in Alabama in order to keep the child safe from the conflict and receive necessary medical care.Jahraus, his wife and their five children hosted Sashko back in December, as part of a pre-adoption program with Bridges of Faith, an Alabama-based nonprofit that helps orphans in Ukraine find homes with American parents. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4448_News_0>To host the boy, Jahraus and his wife had to pass criminal background checks and be certified by Bridges of Faith, according to paperwork provided to Fox News Digital.Jahraus has requested to host Sashko under the same terms as the original pre-adoption program, with a guarantee of bringing the back to Ukraine on Sept. 7, 2022, the paperwork shows.Jahraus told Fox News Digital that he has provided the paperwork to Ukraine’s Ministry of Social Policy, which oversees all adoptions of Ukrainian children by international families.\"The idea is in no way to subvert or interfere with proper adoption proceedings,\" Jahraus said. \"We’re not going to violate any laws.\"Last week, Jahraus was able to talk with Sashko on a video call. Jahraus said that Sashko, who was in an orphanage in Lviv, seemed his usual self, \"very sweet\" and a little \"goofy.\"\"Once we hung up, I just lost it,\" Jahraus said. In order to get permission to host Sashko temporarily in Alabama for a second time, Jahraus has also been trying to get a medical exemption approved by government officials.Sashko was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome by a child psychologist at the American Medical Centers in Kyiv, according to a letter provided to Fox News Digital. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4448_News_1>In the letter, Dr. Dmytro Martsenkovskyi explained that Sashko \"requires intensive psychological interventions that are impossible to provide at the refugee camp.\"\"In my patient’s case, it is crucial not to postpone the psychiatric care as it will impair the prognosis badly,\" Martsenkovskyi wrote, adding that he recommends the \"urgent evacuation\" of Sashko. Jahraus told Fox News Digital that with that letter, he thought he might get permission to evacuate Sashko, so he flew to Poland on March 8.While he waited to hear from officials, Jahraus worked with Bridges of Faith to help Ukrainian refugees by buying them groceries and plane tickets so that they could stay with family members in other countries. First, Jahraus reached out to the director of the orphanage where Sashko has been staying to see if she would give permission to evacuate the boy from Ukraine.The director declined permission — but suggested Jahraus reach out to her supervisor to get the medical exemption approved, the doctor shared with Fox News Digital.\"The supervisor said, ‘OK, if you can prove medical need, I will sign off on it,’\" Jahraus said, explaining that all communication was done through an interpreter.Jahraus sent the supervisor Martsenkovskyi’s letter but got a short response. \"In accordance with instructions of the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine, the departure of children from Ukraine in the family of foreign nationals during hostilities is prohibited,\" the email said, according to a translation.Fox News Digital emailed the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine for comment but has not yet received a response.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4448_News_2>This past Sunday, Jahraus returned to Alabama so that he could care for his patients. In a Facebook post, Jahraus described how it felt to return home to Alabama without Sashko. \"It hurts to acknowledge I don't have our precious Sashko with me,\" Jahraus wrote. He went on to describe feeling \"deeply troubled\" by the circumstances. And later, in another Facebook post, Jahraus said it was \"depressing\" to leave Poland without Sashko.Jahraus also described how his faith is helping him through this difficult time. \"I will keep doing my part from Alabama, but I will trust in God's goodness,\" Jahraus wrote.In several translated Facebook posts, the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine explained that it won’t allow adoptions during times of war because it is \"impossible\" to ensure documentation of potential adoptive parents or the children who might be adopted. \"There are great risks that a child may fall into fraudsters, persons who will not ensure their rights and best interests, or human traffickers,\" the Ministry of Social Policy said on Facebook.A State Department official told Fox News Digital in an email that although some children from Ukraine were eligible for \"hosting programs,\" those children may not necessarily be eligible for adoption. Ultimately, the adoption of Ukrainian children is solely decided by Ukrainian authorities.On its website, the National Council For Adoption (NCFA) explained why Ukrainian orphans can’t be adopted during war.\"Adoption is only a possibility for children for whom parental rights have been terminated or for whom there is clear evidence that they are orphaned,\" the NCFA said.\"It is paramount that the identities of these children and their families be clearly established, and their social, legal and familial status is fully verified by governmental authorities,\" the council added. \"For most of these children, we cannot do that at this time.\"Jahraus said he understands that officials are concerned about bad actors taking advantage of children, but he also wants to make sure Sashko is safe and gets the care he needs. \"That’s not us,\" Jahraus said. \"We’ve been vetted already … We’re not random people.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4448_News_3>At this point, Jahraus said the only person who can help him is Maryna Lazebna, the minister of Social Policy of Ukraine. \"We are working furiously and tirelessly to get the Ukrainian Minister of Social Policy to grant us a waiver to take Sashko home with us for six months,\" Jahraus said.Jahraus said he's sent Lazebna an email with all his documentation and the letter from Sashko’s doctor. As of early this week, Jahraus said he hadn't heard back. Jahraus said he asked Lazebna to make an exception for Sashko.\"I said, ‘This is a kid for whom we have a documented medical need, for whom I’m not trying to get around the adoption process,’\" Jahraus said. He added later, \"I know that in a time of war, looking at the individual is nearly impossible. But I don’t care.

In the meantime, he's seeking a \"green\" humanitarian corridor to bring in badly needed food as well as fuel to keep the animals warm. They have been essentially cut off since the second day of the Russian invasion that began Feb. 24.\"[I'm trying] to draw the attention and somehow persuade the [Russian] troops, their commanders, their politicians, that animals are innocent creatures and these are the lives we have and must save, and they have nothing to do with that war,\" Pinchuk told Fox News Digital.\"I really hope they will not die like this,\" he added.There is very little food left for the animals, who are being fed far under their usual daily rations. And with Russians encircling Kyiv, the only way out, Pinchuk said, would be to drive north to the hottest combat areas. So far, he has only been able to get scant Red Cross food rations in for him and his remaining seven staff members at the roughly 40-acre complex.\"To sum up, we see that the only way out for us is they allow us in, we bring in diesel and food for large animals, and then we can take some smaller ones out, and maybe we will be able to preserve the collection,\" he said. \"Other than this, it is a question of death of hunger and cold, and it is coming pretty soon, I know that.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_0>Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown little regard for human life with the invasion of Ukraine that has killed thousands on both sides of the conflict, including hundreds of Ukrainian civilians. But he is known for his fondness for animals; he owns numerous dogs and has been photographed with wild animals like dolphins, cranes, and polar bears. The Washington Post even called him a \"renowned animal lover\" in 2014.\"While the Russian president may be a former KGB agent and expert in martial arts with a reputation as a fierce political leader, he has frequently shown his softer side around animals,\" the Post reported at the time.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_1><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_2><IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_3>Pinchuk, who left his job in commercial real estate to bring his dream of running a zoo to life six years ago, will bring his message to anyone who will listen. Even getting a band of orangutans out of the zoo since the war started was akin to a \"military operation\" and a \"nightmare,\" Pinchuk said, although his wife was able to successfully transport them to another zoo.\"We are crying, we're shouting, we're doing whatever we can to draw attention that I at least go there with some food and fuel to warm them up and feed them, and the smallest animals I can take to a different zoo,\" he said.\"You cannot transport a rhino by a broken bridge,\" he added, noting Ukrainian forces have destroyed bridges in an effort to stall the Russian advance.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_4>So far, Pinchuk said the zoo has only lost a \"few\" animals, all due to panic over the shelling and bombing from Russian forces, including one monkey. The remaining ones are often unsettled by the explosions, and a staff that's one-tenth its usual size is left to keep the animals as calm and fed as possible.\"When our rhino hears all these bombs, he starts running around the cage,\" Pinchuk said, recounting how he pierced a water-carrying device with his horn.His zoo has made international news before when wire service Reuters featured his and the animals' struggles at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic.The enemy this time is much more visible.\"Dying of cold and hunger is not a better thing than dying from missiles,\" Pinchuk said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//media/ukraine-zookeeper-hundreds-animals-food-fuel", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A rhino at the XII Months zoo in Demydiv, Ukraine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/RHINO-UKRAINE-ZOO.jpg"}, {"caption": "A giraffe at the XII Months zoo in Demydiv, Ukraine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/GIRAFFE-UKRAINE-ZOO.jpg"}, {"caption": "A monkey at the XII Months Zoo in Demydiv, Ukraine.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/CHIMPANZEE-ZOO-UKRAINE.jpg"}, {"caption": "XII Months Zoo, located just outside Kyiv, Ukraine, could lose all of its animals, its owner tells Fox News Digital.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/12-MONTHS-ZOO-UKRAINE.jpg"}, {"caption": "A white lioness and one of her three cubs are seen in a private zoo called \"12 Months\" in the town of Demydiv, Ukraine, January 13, 2016.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4505_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/WHITE-LION-12-MONTHS-UKRAINE-ZOO.jpg"}]}

They became louder as they got closer.Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine, was being bombed by Russian forces as they invaded her homeland.\"I turned on the news and went to my Facebook feed to find out what was going on,\" the 26-year-old recalled to Fox News Digital. \"I saw my friends were posting things like, ‘The war has started. The Russians have invaded Ukraine and they are bombing Kyiv.’ I was so shocked. I just took all of my clothes - I already had my luggage ready. I woke up my son [Alex], and I took him to my car. I just started driving to the west of Ukraine. I had to get out of there.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_0>The beauty queen, who won the title of Miss Ukraine 2018, first realized something was wrong several days before - on Feb. 18. At the time, American President Biden said he was convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to invade Ukraine and that he believed Russian forces would target Kyiv \"in the coming week\" or sooner.\"I remember he spoke about how they noticed many soldiers on the border of Ukraine and that they would invade,\" Didusenko explained. \"Putin had pretty much set the date. After I heard that speech, I really started to get worried about the safety of our country, of my family, and all of those in Ukraine. I would check the news all the time. That's why I had my suitcase ready. Just in case.\"\"I spoke to many of my friends and some said, ‘We’re staying, we don’t believe Putin is going to go this mad, this violent and start a war,’\" she continued. \"But I was very frightened. Even after Biden’s speech, I remember I went to a café in Kyiv, and there were so many foreigners. I was sitting there, thinking, ‘What are they doing here? Why are they still in Ukraine after all of these announcements and warnings? After the Biden administration said Americans need to leave Ukraine as soon as possible?’ But people were sitting there having their lunch. Everything was peaceful. There was no sign of a Russian invasion to come.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_1>Since the invasion occurred, hundreds have been reported dead or wounded, including children. According to the United Nations, more than a million Ukrainians have also fled to safety. The attack, ordered by Putin, has drawn condemnation around the world as well as increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia.For Didusenko, she was determined to find safety for herself and her 7-year-old. She, along with thousands of other families, left the city. Countless cars formed a traffic jam on the highway on the way out of Kyiv that lasted for hours, she said.\"It took us two days to get out of Ukraine because of huge traffic jams,\" she said. \"Everyone was rushing to the border as well. I was driving with military cars on one side and tanks on the other side with Russian helicopters flying above my head. I was very scared for my life and my son’s. There wasn’t enough food, enough water. You especially couldn’t sleep with the sirens going on all the time. Every noise from a car or plane made me look around. I was worried that it was a rocket, a bomb or someone shooting. I can’t even begin to imagine what the people who stayed are going through. I knew I had to survive.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_2>Didusenko admitted that she is still recovering from the sights and sounds she witnessed. Even as she spoke, her voice trembled. Didusenko noted how lucky she was, as not everyone had the chance to flee. She noted that bridges have been destroyed since she left and others have been killed in their attempt to find refuge.\"All that mattered to me was saving my son’s life,\" she said. \"I just took my stuff and left quickly. At that moment, you don’t care about anything else. You’re just thinking of finding safety, a place where there are no rockets, bombs or sirens. It’s the only thing you can think of to try to save your life.\"According to Didusenko, she and her child traveled through three countries before they finally arrived in Switzerland, where she had friends. After arriving in Geneva, she headed to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled months in advance to speak alongside Gloria Allred on March 8 - International Women’s Day. Her goal this time, she said, was to make a public plea on behalf of Ukrainians under attack.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_3>\"I wanted to speak about the war, about the devastation in Ukraine that I witnessed with my eyes,\" she said. \"I wanted people to understand what was going on. I have a U.S. visa, but my son doesn’t have one. I went to the United States embassy in Luxembourg to apply for a visa for him. But he was denied. The embassy did not issue a visa for my son. I was so shocked. They said to me, ‘You can leave your son in Europe with your friends and go to the U.S.’ And I was like, ‘Are you serious? After the bombing in Kyiv, after everything we experienced, I now have to leave my son in Europe?’\"\"This is a horrible situation,\" she said. \"So many women and children who’ve fled cannot truly enter the United States because they cannot be issued a visa in time. During my press conference with Gloria Allred, we spoke about the fact that women and children fleeing for their lives must be given something like temporary protected status or humanitarian parole so that they can have a chance to go to the United States if they wanted to.\"Didusenko said friends in Switzerland, who had moved to Geneva six months prior, volunteered to care for Alex while she traveled to Los Angeles. During her talk with Fox News Digital, Didusenko was headed to LAX to take a flight back to Geneva. She has since been reunited with Alex.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_4>\"It’s so traumatizing for a child to experience war,\" she said. \"Whenever he talks to our friends, he tells them, ‘My mommy took me away from Ukraine so that I don’t get shot.’ He understands the whole situation, how serious it is. But he also understands that I would do everything to protect him.\"Didusenko’s news conference with Allred wasn’t the first time she spoke up about issues impacting women in her native Ukraine. Just days after she was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018, Didusenko was stripped of her title for being a divorced mother, which is against entry requirements, People Magazine reported. According to the outlet, she started the nonprofit Right to Be a Mother in hopes of changing the rules for the Miss World and Miss Universe pageants.Despite the ongoing conflict, Didusenko commended Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for being \"an amazing leader.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_5>\"He’s handling this extremely well,\" she said. \"He’s a leader trying to do everything possible to unite our people, to keep them strong… This war is a tragedy for Ukraine. Now people are forced to fight or flee for their lives. It is terrorism against a peaceful, independent, democratic country.\"When asked what is giving her hope today, Didusenko replied, \"you don’t need any hope.\" But she is certain that \"one day, sooner or later,\" Ukraine will thrive as \"an independent, free country that is more united and strong.\"\"You just have to do the best you can to fight for yourself, for your future, for the future of Ukraine,\" she said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//entertainment/former-miss-ukraine-veronika-didusenko-escape-ukraine-russian-invasion", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Veronkia Didusenko was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/ThePressServiceofVeronikaDidusenko_VeronikaDidusenko_MissUkraine.jpg"}, {"caption": "Veronika Didusenko and her 7-year-old son, Alex.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/ThePressServiceofVeronikaDidusenko_VeronikaDidusenko_Son.jpg"}, {"caption": "Veronika Didusenko left Kyiv with her son, Alex, on Feb. 24 when the Russian invasion began.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4589_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/Getty_VeronikaDidusenko_UkraineFlag.jpg"}, {"caption": "Attorney Gloria Allred and Miss Ukraine 2018 Veronika Didusenko hold a Ukrainian flag at a news conference on March 8, 2022, in Los Angeles, California.

{"title": "Tucker Carlson: Biden's propaganda is meant to distract you from the real crises", "body": "We keep a detailed daily calendar. We checked this morning and believe it or not, this week is the two-year anniversary of the coronavirus lockdowns. Those are the first mass quarantines in American history and if you look back, you'll be struck by how much has changed since those lockdowns began. Think back to the America you grew up in. There were three things you knew about that country: It was a free country. It was a middle-class country. It was defined by small business and it was a constitutional country. Our politicians were limited by the guardrails in our founding documents. They couldn't go past that. So, it was a happy place.  Unfortunately, none of those three things are still true about the United States and lockdowns are not entirely to blame for that. No single cause ever is, but there's no question that the coronavirus lockdowns accelerated the transformation of the United States. Just think of masks. So, we knew early on that paper masks were not going to stop the spread of COVID.  A couple of studies, including a big study from Vietnam, showed pretty clearly that they were not effective and then we watched the behavior of our public officials. It turns out they didn't like masks any more than anyone else liked masks, despite the fact they had ordered you to wear masks. When they thought no one was watching, they often went bare faced. So, you saw that, and you had to wonder: If masks are so darn effective and lifesaving, why aren't our leaders wearing them?   <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4598_News_0>We made that point. We made many points like it. We made them dozens of times on the show and, needless to say, it had no effect at all. The mask mandates stayed. In some places, they still remain. So, as this unfolded, we started to realize that masks, in fact a lot of this, was not really about  or public health. So, what was it about?  Well, recently we learned the answer because we watched it. Masks were a training exercise. Mandatory masking was a shock collar designed to teach Americans unquestioning obedience and, of course, it worked because shock collars do work. In a single day last month we watched, for example, our entire professional class dutifully changed their Twitter avatars from mask up to the now mandatory Ukrainian flag.  There was no debate about doing this, no reflection. There was not even a real conversation. They just did it. Millions of people simply assumed reflexively a partisan position in a highly complicated foreign crisis, the next crisis, and as they did it, they moved in perfect lockstep. They were guided by their masters of the social media companies who were themselves taking direction from the .  The whole thing was like watching synchronized swimming in Pyongyang. It was an amazing performance. Most amazing of all was seeing Republican leaders join the herd after two years of COVID training, they couldn't help themselves. The result was the largest political flash mob in American history—Republicans, Democrats, business titans and the media all on one side.  So, of course, dissent of any kind was banned instantly and if you persist in asking questions about all of this found themselves censored and those who persisted in asking questions because they were lucky enough to have a rare, protected platform, found themselves threatened with something worse—maybe indictment, maybe arrest. Here's former Senator Claire McCaskill of , threatening this show just last night. Oh, so defending our country from your recklessness and unwise decision-making is treason? Declare your loyalty to Ukraine or you've committed a crime, right? Claire McCaskill, whatever you think of her, was not talking like that two years ago. No one in public was talking that way two years ago, before COVID. In a free country, you're allowed to say what you think is true. You can defend your country if you want, even if politicians disagree with you. That was the whole point of living in the United States, but not anymore.  Now, if enough powerful people, that would be former senators, New York Times columnists, retired Intel chiefs working as contributors to MSNBC, if enough of these people call for you to be indicted, you probably will be indicted. If not for the core crime, then for another crime. They'll find something. That's our justice system now works. Those are the rules. This is a big change over what we had before for about 250 years.  <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4598_News_1>So how do we get this new system? Simple, we eliminated the guardrails. We got rid of the principles that set limits to our leaders' power. Those principles, in short, were personal autonomy and the sanctity of the citizens' conscience. And we surrendered both of those during COVID. They no longer exist. We let them go. Once we allowed political leaders to force Americans to take drugs they didn't want, the old arrangement where the citizen had as much or more power as the leaders was over. Our politicians now have effectively limitless power, and they know that. They know it perfectly well. That's why they did it and if you doubt that they know it, watch the way they communicate with the American population.  They're giving you propaganda. They always have. What's changed is that their propaganda is no longer sophisticated or persuasive because it doesn't have to be. Instead, their propaganda is blunt and vulgar. They summon TikTok performers to the White House so that some 18-year-old, who has never had a job, can tell you that inflation and historically high gas prices are actually  fault. They just did that, in fact. Here's the result.  OK, so nothing against teenage energy expert in Lycra you just saw, but that is not the way you communicate with a population in a democracy. That's not the way you talk to free people. That is the way that you command your serfs. You assume that they're stupid and so you serve them up stupid propaganda. You patronize them like you're speaking to a housekeeper at a hotel in Cabo. \"We call this oil. It costs very much now. Vladimir Putin, very bad man.\" That's what they're saying and they're saying it for a reason, because when you no longer respect your own citizens, you can't be bothered to speak in complex sentences.  You have TikTok influencers deliver your lines. All around this, this is happening even on former news channels. This is exactly what they're doing. That's their power, but it's not their main power. Their main power, the one they deploy most often, is the power to change the subject, the power to force you to ignore what actually matters to you and your family and your country, and focus instead on what matters to them. They call it democracy. Congress, at the moment, for example, is totally absorbed in the question of how to arm . How many MiGs should be sending to Zelenskyy and how do we get them there?  Now, that's not an issue that directly or even indirectly is related to the many, many...growing number of pressing problems the United States is facing domestically, but even on its own terms, even you think that's the most important thing that we could be talking about, they're not really talking about it in any complete sense and if you doubt that, ask yourself how you would handle it.   <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4598_News_2>You're the Congress and you're moved by the suffering in Ukraine. Every American is. Americans are kind people. They want to help. Civilians in Ukraine are being crushed by Vladimir Putin. That's true. How can we help? Well, why don't we send more weapons to Ukraine in the middle of a war? It doesn't sound like a bad idea, but if you're going to make that decision, you'd probably feel some kind of moral obligation to consider the ramifications. Like, what effect will this actually have? Is it possible that doing this, as well-intentioned as it is, (and it is) is it possible doing this will be counterproductive? Will it hurt the people I'm hoping to help?  Will it, for example, prolong the fighting in Ukraine at the expense of the vulnerable civilian population in Ukraine? If I do this, could I inadvertently be doing to Ukraine what the West inadvertently did to, let's say, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Afghanistan? You wouldn't want that. You'd hate to do something like that again, because that would be cruel. So, you'd want to make sure you weren't doing that. But not a single person in Washington, at least in public, appears to be asking that question. No one's allowed to ask that question. What are you a Putin defender? And in fact, as well-meaning as most Americans are—most of our lawmakers are well-meaning—you get the sense that the core figures in our foreign policy establishment don't really care. And in fact, never have cared about the effects of their policy.  We can give you a million examples. Here's one: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright way back in 1996, shrugged off the documented deaths of half a million Iraqi children. Not a small number, half a million, because imposing sanctions on Saddam Hussein was \"worth it.\" So, keep in mind that debate, that conversation, was about sanctions, which were certainly going to hurt Saddam Hussein. They didn't. He ended up invading seven years later because sanctions didn't work. When have sanctions worked exactly to achieve their desired outcome? Let us know when you find out, but in the meantime, a half a million children died, but it was worth it. Because, because why?   <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4598_News_3>Well, in retrospect, sadly, and it burdens the conscience of every decent person, it's hard to see why it was worth it, but you should know that these are exactly the same people who are now giving you more lectures right now. In fact, at this very moment on every other channel on television, 24 hours a day, about how we have a moral obligation to wade blindly into a war in Eastern Europe against a country that has not attacked us and if we don't do that, you're a traitor.  What's going on here? High levels of aggression, that's for sure, but deflection too. Our leaders are a master of deflection. They yell so you won't notice what else is happening. What else is happening? Well, it turns out one of the biggest stories of the decade dropped this morning, you may not even be aware of it, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia is considering accepting Chinese currency rather than U.S. dollars for its oil sales to China now. Why is that a big deal? Seems like some little financial story. Well, because it would spell the end of the petrodollar. The petrodollar is one of the keys to the United States' wealth.  Saudi Arabia has traded oil exclusively in U.S. dollars for nearly half a century and that is one of the key reasons the United States has the highest living standard of any big country in the world, despite the fact that our manufacturing sector long ago collapsed. You may have wondered how that worked. Why are we still so rich? Well, this is how. Petrodollars allow our government, in short, to spend money that we don't have and that money pays for an awful lot of what we have—healthcare, retirements, the military. We could go on—everything, essentially. As economist Gal Luft put it in interview with The Wall Street Journal today, \"The oil market and by extension, the entire global commodities market, is the insurance policy of the status of the dollar is the reserve currency. If that block is taken out of the wall, the wall will begin to collapse.\" What's the wall? Well, it's the U.S. economy. Not a small story, maybe even a bigger story than the invasion of Ukraine. Weird that we're not talking about it. Meanwhile, at the exact same moment that happened there's this: The Chinese government has decided to wound our already teetering economy once again by using the pretext of COVID. So, the Chinese have ordered lockdowns in factory towns, towns that make Toyotas, Volkswagen, circuit boards, air conditioning units, batteries, televisions and, yes, iPhones.  Now why are they doing this? Well, you're supposed to believe it's all about the coronavirus, which has mysteriously resurged in China in the middle of a war in which China is siding with the country that we are against, Russia. Can that really be true? Hard to believe. Is it really just the virus that's causing this behavior? Yes, say the propagandists of The Washington Post, it definitely is. It's definitely not a trade war brought on by the Biden administration's incompetence in international affairs. We're not suffering for the fact they don't know what they're doing. No, it's just a virus.   A pundit called Catherine Rampell, for example, told us with a straight face that, \"Daily COVID cases in China have reached numbers not publicly reported since 2020...Thanks partly to low vaccination rates for the elderly in China, plus the relative ineffectiveness of Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines, the Chinese government has responded to outbreaks with an iron fist.\" They should have gone with Pfizer like we did. Now none of that, of course, explains why cases are higher in China now that they were in the beginning of the pandemic, but The Washington Post doesn't want you to think about that. They want you to think about vaccines. It was all about vaccines. It turns out the Chinese have a pandemic of the unvaccinated too, and don't they deserve it?  Speaking of news you may not be hearing about, a hot war is in progress 50 yards from Texas, which is an American state. No one seems to notice that either because we're focused on Ukraine. According to one report, a Mexican cartel engaged local authorities in a shootout for more than three hours. There were burning trucks with no one responding to them. That's a war.  The U.S. Consulate has just warned Americans to avoid the area or secure shelter. That's our southern border, over which two million people flowed this year with no restraints whatsoever. Meanwhile, in our country, a convoy of American citizens dared to peacefully protest their own government as they assume the Constitution guaranteed them the right to do and yet they have been blocked unconstitutionally from entering their own capital city, Washington, D.C.   It's not just truckers who are banned from entering Washington, D.C., it's everyone. D.C. police somehow were allowed to block off many exits yesterday to drivers for more than two hours. This is the same city that rewarded violent Black Lives Matter protesters with a mural.So maybe you're for that, maybe you're not, but in normal times, that would be a big story because our constitutional rights are wrapped up in it and we should be debating what the limits of those rights are, how much power our politicians have, how much power we want them to have, but we're not because Ukraine, because you changed your Twitter name to the Ukrainian flag. It's the new crisis. You're not supposed to pay attention to any of the other crises, particularly here at home.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-propaganda-real-crises", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4598_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "An employee arranges finished protective masks into piles on the production line at the Taiwan Comfort Champ Manufacturing Co. plant in Taoyuan, Taiwan, on Friday, June 12, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4598_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/aaaMasksPile.jpg"}, {"caption": "Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) concedes defeat in her bid to keep her U.S. Senate seat during an election-night rally on November 6, 2018 in St. Louis, Missouri.

So the U.K. had been at war for more than two years prior to the United States entering the fray in December 1941. In a stark speech, Churchill predicted that allied powers would need a year-and-a-half before they could begin to see progress. Churchill also cautioned Americans about what was ahead as they joined the conflict. He said that \"many disappointments and unpleasant surprises await us.\"Churchill warned those who would challenge the United Kingdom and the United States.\"What kind of a people do they think we are? Is it possible that they do not realize that we shall never cease to persevere against them until they have been taught a lesson which they and the world will never forget?,\" asked Churchill in the Senate chamber.

{"title": "Russia duped Europe into energy dependence by funding 'rabid environmental groups': experts", "body": "For years, world leaders have accused Russia of funding environmental groups in Europe to steer nations away from energy independence and strengthen Russia’s iron grip over the continent. As nations across the globe begin shunning Russian oil in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. leaders are also questioning how deep Russia’s ties go in the environmental community. \"The Russians actually fund some of the most rabid environmental groups in Europe because they sic them on the energy projects that aren’t Russian,\" James Carafano, vice president of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital in a recent phone interview. Back in June 2014, just months after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, European leaders sounded off that Russia was using disinformation operations with environmental groups to steer countries away from fracking in favor of Russian oil. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_0>\"I have met allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organisations - environmental organisations working against shale gas - to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas,\" Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former prime minister of Denmark and then-secretary-general of NATO, said, according to the Guardian. NATO’s press office passed the remarks off as Rasmussen’s personal views, but one NATO official sounded the alarm that Russia’s grip on Europe was tightening. \"We don't go into the details of discussions among allied leaders, but Russia has been using a mix of hard and soft power in its attempt to recreate a sphere of influence, including through a campaign of disinformation on many issues, including energy. In general, the potential for Russia using energy supplies as a means of putting pressure on European nations is a matter of concern. No country should use supply and pricing terms as tools of coercion,\" the NATO official told the Guardian in 2014. Environmental groups have meanwhile feverishly denied any ties to Russia. \"The idea we’re puppets of Putin is so preposterous that you have to wonder what they’re smoking over at NATO HQ,\" Greenpeace told the Guardian in 2014.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_1>By 2016, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Scotland and Bulgaria had all banned fracking, either temporarily or permanently. Russia’s power over European energy grew large by 2022, providing roughly 40% of the continent’s natural gas supply. Lithuania, for example, gets 83% of its oil imports from Russia, Poland gets 58% and Finland 80%, The Hill reported. \"You're not really an independent nation if you depend on foreign countries so heavily for your energy supplies,\" Michael Shellenberger, the best-selling author of \"Apocalypse Never,\" told Fox News earlier this month. Shellenberger said that 15 years ago, \"Europe produced more natural gas than Russia,\" but that all changed as \"Russia increased its natural gas production and Europe reduced it.\" \"Europe decided not to frack in large part in response to climate activists,\" Shellenberger told Fox News. \"We now think there is strong evidence suggesting [the climate activists] were supported directly through financing from Russia.\" In the U.S., Republican Reps. Lamar Smith and Randy Weber sent a letter to then-Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin in 2017 arguing that Russia’s goal is to \"suppress the widespread adoption of fracking in Europe and the U.S.\" by funding such environmental groups. The two Republicans , who complained during a private 2014 speech about \"phony environmental groups\" pushing an anti-fracking agenda. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_2>\"We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I’m a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort, ‘Oh that pipeline, that fracking, that whatever will be a problem for you,’ and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia,\" Clinton said, according to excerpts leaked by WikiLeaks in 2016.  Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are now holding three environmental groups’ feet to the fire. The Republicans, led by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, are demanding that the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sierra Club disclose their ties to a San Francisco-based nongovernmental organization that Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly uses to wield power over American energy production.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_3>\"Provided the public reporting of Putin's dark money influence in Europe and the concerns surrounding similar efforts in the United States, we write today to explore your connections with Sea Change,\" the Republicans wrote in the letter to the three groups last week. \"Any action by President Putin, the Russian government, or Putin's allies to undermine American energy security must be addressed.\"The three groups denied any ties in a previous comment to Fox News, describing the accusations as \"completely false,\" \"rooted in a smear campaign,\" and a phony \"conspiracy theory.\"\"It is vital to our national security to know if Vladimir Putin, the Russian government, or Putin’s allies are meddling with America’s energy affordability and security. If the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, or Sierra Club have nothing to hide, then we look forward to seeing the evidence they provide by March 25th,\" House Energy and Commerce Committee Republican leader McMorris Rodgers told Fox News Digital.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/russia-funding-environmental-groups-europe-united-state", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen pauses before speaking during a Carnegie Europe think tank event at the Bibliotheque Solvay in Brussels on Monday, Sept. 15, 2014.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Belgium-NATO-Rasmussen-3.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this undated photo released by Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, an oil drilling platform 'Kolskaya' is seen in the Sea of Okhotsk.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/RussiaOilPlatform.jpg"}, {"caption": "Hillary Clinton", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1237151473-e1641843224446.jpg"}, {"caption": "Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting in Moscow, Russia.", "id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4715_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/putin-list.jpg"}]}

{"title": "2024 rematch: Biden, Trump, deadlocked in new poll", "body": "It was one of the biggest applause lines in former President Donald Trump’s roughly hour-long speech this weekendThe former president, speaking at a rally Saturday night in Florence, South Carolina, once again flirted with launching another White House campaign in 2024, saying that \"we may have to run again.\"\"In 2024 we are going to take back that beautiful, beautiful White House,\" Trump said, repeating a well-used line.  \"I wonder who will do that. I wonder. I wonder.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4888_News_0>And with President Biden saying that he’ll run for a second term in the White House if he remains healthy, we may be headed for a 2024 rematch of the 2020 presidential election.According to a national poll released Friday by the Wall Street Journal, it’s all tied up between the president and the former president at this extremely early point in the next presidential election cycle.Voters were split at 45% in a hypothetical matchup between Biden and Trump, when asked who they would vote for in 2024. The poll was conducted March 2-7 and the results on the 2024 matchup question remain unchanged from the Journal’s previous poll conducted in November. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4888_News_1>Trump remains the most popular and influential politician in the Republican Party as he continues to play a kingmaker’s role in the GOP 2022 primaries.And South Carolina plays an important role in presidential politics, as it holds the first southern primary and votes third in the GOP’s presidential nominating calendar.Dave Wilson – the president of the Columbia, South Carolina based conservative Christian nonprofit the Palmetto Family Council – told Fox News that Trump’s rally \"is much about impacting Washington DC in 2022 as it is about 2024.\"He suggested that Trump could use the rally to \"see exactly where the voters are to make an informed choice about what he’s going to do in 2024.\"But Trump's far from the only potential Republican White House hopeful to stop in the state over the past year. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4888_News_2>The other possible contender who's made the most visits - former Vice President Mike Pence, who's scheduled to return to the Palmetto State twice this spring.Wilson spotlighted that anyone interested in running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination \"recognizes the importance of South Carolina\" and \"how important South Carolina is to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue becoming your place of residence.\"Pence met on Thursday with Ukrainian refugees flooding into Poland as they escaped Russia's military assault of their country. Pence, who has condemned Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s deadly invasion, was in Ukraine along its border with Poland. \"The impact of the Russian invasion on these families is heartbreaking and the need for support is great,\" Pence emphasized in a tweet.Pence was accompanied by his wife, former second lady Karen Pence. The two traveled to the region with Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian humanitarian organization. They were joined by the group’s vice president of operations, Edward Graham, who’s the son of the organization’s president, the nationally known evangelical pastor Franklin Graham.Pence, who’s mulling a 2024 GOP presidential nomination run, was on an overseas trip that also took him to Israel on Wednesday.The former vice president a week ago made headlines regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, when he told a Republican National Committee gathering of top donors that \"there is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom.\"A Republican source in the room at the appearance by Pence in New Orleans, Louisiana, told Fox News that the line received applause from the audience at the event, which was closed to press.Pence didn’t refer to Trump by name in his comments, but his targeting of those in the GOP who haven’t fully condemned Putin follows multiple remarks made last month by Pence’s former boss describing Putin’s \"genius\" and \"savvy\" in launching the attack.But Trump has also argued that he was \"tough\" on Putin during his four years in the White House and has repeatedly claimed that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president. In recent days the former president’s also described the horrific pictures of Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians as a \"holocaust.Former two-term South Carolina Nikki Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the first two years of the Trump administration, will return to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire early next month to campaign with a former official in Trump’s State Department who’s running for Congress.The trip by Haley, which was first reported by Fox News, will spark more speculation about her possible national ambitions. Haley will spend April 4 in New Hampshire, teaming up with Republican congressional candidate Matt Mowers at multiple stops including a fundraiser in the southern town of Salem. Mowers is one of the top contenders in the crowded GOP primary in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, a longtime premiere House swing district that the GOP’s aiming to flip from blue to red in November’s midterm elections.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4888_News_3>The stop in New Hampshire will be Haley’s first since October 2020, when she campaigned with Mowers during his first bid for the seat. Mowers won the GOP nomination but lost the general election to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas by five points. The two-term Democratic incumbent is running for reelection again this year.Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo returned to Iowa on Friday night for the second time in a month. And it was Pompeo’s fourth trip over the past year to the state whose caucuses for a half century’s kicked off the presidential nominating calendar.Pompeo, a former congressman from Kansas who served as CIA director and later as America’s top diplomat during former the Trump administration, headlined an Iowa GOP fundraising dinner in eastern city of Davenport along with former longtime Hawkeye State Gov. Terry Branstad, who served as ambassador to China under Trump.Fox News learned last month that Pompeo will head back to Iowa again in April for events in the western part of the state.Asked about 2024, Pompeo, told Fox News last summer in Iowa that \"my wife and I will pray and we’ll think our way through it and when we hit 2023, we’ll figure our way through it.\"While Pompeo was in Iowa, the state’s lead off status in the Democratic presidential nominating calendar was facing serious scrutiny at a meeting of the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) Rules and Bylaws Committee Friday evening in the nation’s capital.While there were no final decisions – that will likely come at the DNC’s summer meeting later this year – many of the party members who spoke at the gathering were clearly open to reordering the presidential nominating calendar to better reflect the party’s growing diversity and values.The knock against Iowa and New Hampshire – among some Democrats – for years has been that the states are too White, lack any major urban areas, and aren’t representative of a Democratic Party that’s become increasingly diverse over the past several decades. Nevada and South Carolina are much more diverse and have larger metropolitan areas than either Iowa or New Hampshire.<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4888_News_4>And Nevada Democrats last year passed a bill into law that would transform the state’s presidential caucus into a primary and aim to move the contest to the lead-off position in the race for the White House, ahead of Iowa and New Hampshire. Compounding Iowa's issues was the botched reporting of the 2020 caucuses, which became a national and international story, and an embarrassment for Iowa Democrats as well as the DNC.Among those speaking at the meeting was DNC member Mo Elleithee, who’s long been a proponent of shaking up the calendar. He emphasized there’s a need for changes, \"not four years from now — now.\"\"I think states like New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina can make a compelling argument as to how they fit into that picture,\" Elleithee, who’s also a Fox News contributor, said. \"I have a harder time seeing it with Iowa, but Iowa should have the right to make that case to us.\"Causing controversy ahead of the meeting was a leaked DNC draft proposal, which called for having all the early voting states reapplying for their place in the nominating calendar, with an emphasis on diversity and holding primaries over caucuses.While there’s plenty of drama regarding the DNC’s 2024 calendar, there’s apparently little desire at the Republican National Committee (RNC) to make alterations. At last month’s winter meeting, which was held in Salt Lake City, Utah, was the unanimous passage by an RNC panel of a report that makes no changes to the traditional top of the party’s presidential nominating calendar.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//politics/trump-south-carolina-rally", "page_id": "Fox_Conflicts_Total_4888_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Former President Donald Trump arrives at a rally, Saturday, March 12, 2022, in Florence, S.C.

Meanwhile, his parents and 10-year-old sister remain in Ukraine.Kozlov told Fox News Digital what his experience has been since Russia invaded Ukraine and how he’s reacting to the war. Kozlov said that despite the 9-hour time difference between Pueblo West and Brovary, he calls his mom when he can and texts her every day to check in on his family. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4964_News_0>Kozlov’s dad volunteered to fight in the Ukrainian army; due to safety reasons, the father isn’t able to share details with his family about where he is exactly. Kozlov said his dad recently texted their family chat to let them know he’s OK. Kozlov said his mom and sister, meanwhile, are \"relatively\" safe. \"As much as they can be right now,\" he added. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4964_News_1>Despite the war, Kozlov said his family seems encouraged by how the Ukrainian army is doing. \"What I’m hearing is that they are really optimistic about what’s going on … We believe that we will win the war,\" Kozlov told Fox News Digital. \"And they think that it’s really important to focus on that right now,\" he added. \"Everybody is focusing on all the negativity that is going on there,\" he went on. \"And of course, it’s true. War is not pretty. But keeping optimistic and following the news about Ukrainian military achievements really helps.\"Focusing on those achievements is the way that Kozlov stays positive right now — even though he's far away from his home, his family and the terrible things that are happening in his country. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4964_News_2>Kozlov said he’s constantly checking Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense Facebook page, the Facebook page of the Office of the President of Ukraine, as well as other official sources to find out what’s happening back home. \"What I’m seeing is that they are really doing a good job,\" he said. \"Even though — I mean, we are fighting the second-largest army in the world. So it would be weird if it would be easy. It’s not easy. People are dying. But Ukrainians are doing really well in terms of defending\" the country, he said.\"Ukrainians are putting up a really good fight.\"Ethan Hall, Kozlov’s host dad in Pueblo West, told Fox News Digital that when Russia invaded Ukraine, Kozlov was \"distraught\" by the news. <IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4964_News_3>Hall said that since then, he has had \"very open conversations\" with Kozlov about Ukraine.\"He is a very resilient young man,\" Hall said. \"He shows some very admirable leadership qualities.\"\"I’m proud of him, seeing what he’s doing,\" Hall said. \"But I feel like I am just the last little guidance for him. His parents,\" plus the young man himself, said Hall, \"have molded him into a very, very outstanding young man.\"Burnham Whittington is Kozlov’s English teacher at Pueblo West High School. Whittington told Fox News Digital that Kozlov \"does everything well\" and \"channels most of his emotion into action and energy to make change.\"<IMG Fox_Conflicts_Total_4964_News_4>\"Ivan is diligent and motivated and loves to think,\" Whittington said. \"He is possibly the best student in my English class even though it is his third language.\"Whittington added, \"Ivan is the type of person the world has too few of.

While his dad is fighting in the Ukrainian army, Kozlov’s mom and sister are making military nets and are cooking food for people who have lost their homes and shelter.\"They are trying to help the Ukrainian army as much as they can,\" Kozlov said. \"And they are not alone,\" he added. \"So many people are defending their streets and they are succeeding.\" Living thousands of miles from his native land, Kozlov is doing his part, too. He brought in almost $9,000 in a bake sale fundraiser at his high school. The funds will be going to the Ukrainian Red Cross and Razom for Ukraine. Kozlov said he felt it was important for him to address the issue of closing the airspace over Ukraine.\"Ukraine really, really requires NATO to close the airspace over Ukraine,\" he said. \"It’s crucial for the safety of civilian people in Ukraine, because Russia has been shelling not only military bases, they have been attacking civilian people.\"\"Children are dying,\" he added. \"It’s not only about military anymore. Regular people are suffering, too. And this is one of the steps that our international allies, that NATO, can take to help Ukraine to stop the war.\"He also encouraged Americans who support Ukraine to donate to places like the Red Cross, UNICEF and the Ukrainian army. \"All of those organizations are really making a difference in Ukraine,\" Kozlov said. \"And if Americans could support them, they could contribute to the effort. That’s extremely important and it’s extremely needed.\" Kozlov said the invasion of Ukraine came as a surprise to him, but he’s proud of his fellow Ukrainians who are defending their home.\"It’s not something that I would think would happen to my country, but it’s not really about me or my family,\" Kozlov said. \"Because it involves all the Ukrainians and Ukrainians are heroic people.\"\"I’m proud to be Ukrainian,\" he added. \"I’m proud of my nation and I’m proud of [the] Ukrainian people.

Two of her adult children are now getting water from a new well the family drilled after the old one went dry last year. She’s even supplying water to a neighbor whose well dried up.\"It’s been so dry this last year. We didn’t get much rain. We didn’t get much snowpack,\" Moore said, standing next to a dry well on her property in Chowchilla, California. \"Everybody’s very careful with what water they’re using. In fact, my granddaughter is emptying the kids' little pool to flush the toilets.\"Amid a megadrought plaguing the American West, more rural communities are losing access to groundwater as heavy pumping depletes underground aquifers that aren’t being replenished by rain and snow.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5097_News_0>More than 1,200 wells have run dry this year statewide, a nearly 50% increase over the same period last year, according to the California Department of Water Resources. By contrast, fewer than 100 dry wells were reported annually in 2018, 2019 and 2020.The groundwater crisis is most severe in the San Joaquin Valley, California’s agricultural heartland, which exports fruits, vegetables and nuts around the world.Shrinking groundwater supplies reflect the severity of California’s drought, which is now entering its fourth year. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 94% of the state is in severe, extreme or exceptional drought.California just experienced its three driest years on record, and state water officials said Monday they’re preparing for another dry year because the weather phenomenon known as La Nina is expected to occur for the third consecutive year.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5097_News_1>Farmers are getting little surface water from the state’s depleted reservoirs, so they’re pumping more groundwater to irrigate their crops. That’s causing water tables to drop across California. State data shows that 64% of wells are at below-normal water levels.Water shortages are already reducing the region’s agricultural production as farmers are forced to fallow fields and let orchards wither. An estimated 531,00 acres (215,000 hectares) of farmland went unplanted this year because of a lack of irrigation water, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.As climate change brings hotter temperatures and more severe droughts, cities and states around the world are facing water shortages as lakes and rivers dry up. Many communities are pumping more groundwater and depleting aquifers at an alarming pace.\"This is a key challenge not just for California, but for communities across the West moving forward in adapting to climate change,\" said Andrew Ayres, a water researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5097_News_2>Madera County, north of Fresno, has been hit particularly hard because it relies heavily on groundwater. The county has reported about 430 dry wells so far this year.In recent years, the county has seen the rapid expansion of thirsty almond and pistachio orchards that are typically irrigated by agricultural wells that run deeper than domestic wells.\"The bigger straw is going to suck the water from right beneath the little straw,\" said Madeline Harris, a policy manager with the advocacy group Leadership Council for Justice and Accountability. She stood next to a municipal well that’s run dry in Fairmead, a town of 1,200 surrounded by nut orchards.\"Municipal wells like this one are being put at risk and are going dry because of the groundwater overdraft problems from agriculture,\" Harris said. \"There are families who don’t have access to running water right now because they have dry domestic wells.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5097_News_3>Residents with dry wells can get help from a state program that provides bottled water as well as storage tanks regularly filled by water delivery trucks. The state also provides money to replace dry wells, but there’s a long wait to get a new one.Not everyone is getting assistance.Thomas Chairez said his Fairmead property, which he rents to a family of eight, used to get water from his neighbor’s well. But when it went dry two years ago, his tenants lost access to running water.Chairez is trying to get the county to provide a storage tank and water delivery service. For now, his tenants have to fill up 5-gallon (19-liter) buckets at a friend’s home and transport water by car each day. They use the water to cook and take showers. They have portable toilets in the backyard.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5097_News_4>\"They’re surviving,\" Chairez said. \"In Mexico, I used to do that. I used to carry two buckets myself from far away. So we got to survive somehow. This is an emergency.\"Well drillers are in high demand as water pumps stop working across the San Joaquin Valley.Ethan Bowles and his colleagues were recently drilling a new well at a ranch house in the Madera Ranchos neighborhood, where many wells have gone dry this year.\"It’s been almost nonstop phone calls just due to the water table dropping constantly,\" said Bowles, who works for Chowchilla-based Drew and Hefner Well Drilling. \"Most residents have had their wells for many years and all of a sudden the water stops flowing.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5097_News_5>His company must now drill down 500 and 600 feet (152 to 183 meters) to get clients a steady supply of groundwater. That’s a couple hundred feet deeper than older wells.\"The wells just have to go deeper,\" Bowles said. \"You have to hit a different aquifer and get them a different part of that water table so they can actually have fresh water for their house.\"In March, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order to slow a frenzy of well-drilling over the past few years. The temporary measure prohibits local agencies from issuing permits for new wells that could harm nearby wells or structures.California’s groundwater troubles come as local agencies seek to comply with the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed in 2014 to prevent groundwater overpumping during the last drought. The law requires regional agencies to manage their aquifers sustainably by 2042.Water experts believe the law will lead to more sustainable groundwater supplies over the next two decades, but the road will be bumpy. The Public Policy Institute of California estimates that about 500,000 acres (202,000 hectares) of agricultural land, about 10% of the current total, will have to come out of production over the next two decades.\"These communities are going to be impacted from drinking water supplies and loss of jobs,\" said Isaya Kisekka, a groundwater expert at the University of California, Davis. \"There’s a lot of migration of farmworkers as this land gets fallowed.\"Farmers and residents in the Valley are hoping for help from above. \"Hopefully we get a lot of rain,\" Chairez said. \"There’s a big need: water. We need water, water, water.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/california-wells-run-dry-drought-depletes-groundwater", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5097_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Elaine Moore stands next to a dry irrigation canal and almond orchard near her property, where two wells have gone dry this summer in Chowchilla, Calif., Sept. 14, 2022.

{"title": "Poor Florida neighborhood battered by flood tries to recover", "body": "The Gladiolus Food Pantry usually hands out supplies on Wednesdays to about 240 families, so when Hurricane Ian swept through that day and canceled their distribution, it was left full of flats of canned black beans, bags of rice, meats, bread and produce — food that helps families struggling with rising rents and inflation make ends meet.By the weekend, much of that food was in the garbage, the floors were still wet and muddy from the floodwaters that had filled the room, and the pantry's founder and director, Miriam Ortiz, was worried about what would become of her neighborhood as she worked to get the pantry she started nine years ago up and running again.\"Right now I don’t know what we’re going to do because we’re going to need food, we’re going to need water, we're going to need everything,\" she said. \"We got flooded and the water came through all the building.\"Ortiz said the food pantry's green building is the heart of the Harlem Heights neighborhood, a small, mostly Hispanic community of nearly 2,000 people near Fort Myers that was hammered by the Category 4 hurricane. A sign scrawled on a piece of roofing that had torn loose advertised free food, diapers, wipes, body wash and toothpaste.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5116_News_0>The wind, rain and storm surge that accompany hurricanes affect everyone in their path. But those combined effects are often more of a disaster for poor people living day to day, like many in Harlem Heights, where the median income is a little under $26,000, according to U.S. Census data.Many are hourly workers with little savings for things such as evacuation hotel stays or money to tide them over until their places of employment reopen. In a tourism heavy economy like South Florida's, the wait for hotels to reopen and visitors — along with the jobs they bring — to return can be long and agonizing.Ortiz said many of the clients she was seeing every week before the hurricane were already hurting from the skyrocketing cost of food and housing. Rising rents had forced many young adults that had been living on their own to move back in with parents and grandparents, she said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5116_News_1>Over the weekend, cars and trucks whizzed down the neighborhood's main road, which was dry and had been swept free of tree limbs and palm fronds. That wasn't the case on many side streets, many of which were still submerged in water as residents hauled waterlogged furniture to the curb.At Maria Galindo's apartment, the water had risen to about hip height and the wind had ripped off part of her roof while she and her 9-year-old daughter, Gloria, were terrified inside. Her daughter said that during the storm, she kept thinking she wanted to return to her native Guatemala.\"We did not know where to go, where to grab onto, whether here or there because of the rain, the wind, the water. ... It was very difficult,\" said Maria Galindo, speaking in Spanish.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5116_News_2>They and their neighbors were trying to salvage what they could and to push the water from their waterlogged apartments. Wet clothes hung from a clothes line outside, while inside a thin seam of light coming between the wall and ceiling showed where the roof had been lifted.Galindo works as a housekeeper at a local hotel, but it's closed until further notice. She's worried for her family and her daughter and wondering how she'll make ends meet.\"We are without a roof overhead. We need food. We need money to buy things,\" she said. \"We need help.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5116_News_3>Back at the food pantry, people had been delivering donations of food, cleaning supplies and clothing throughout the day Saturday, and a volunteer had set up a tent and was cooking food for people.One of those who dropped by to deliver supplies was a frustrated Lisa Bertaux, who came with her friend. She ticked off the items that people needed: toothbrushes, deodorant, cleaning supplies, paper towels, children's clothes and wipes. And the list went on.\"There is so much need here. ... There’s very little food coming in so far. There’s a great need,\" she said. \"It’s time for us to rebuild our community.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5116_News_4>One of those coming by to pick up supplies was Keyondra Smith, who lives down the street in an apartment complex with her three kids. She had parked her car in a different area so that when the floodwaters came sweeping through, she didn't lose it. Her neighbors weren't so lucky, as cars floated through the parking lot during the worst of the flooding and the people who lived on the first floor — she's on the second — were completely flooded out.Smith had been driving by the food pantry when she noticed it had supplies so she stopped to pick up some toilet paper, water and hot plates of food. Before that, her family had been eating raviolis out of a can, Vienna sausages and snacks from a local convenience store.\"We don’t have any water. My food is spoiling in the refrigerator,\" she said. Though she can drive to the few stores that are open, she said they are only taking cash and many of the ATMs aren't working. \"I have three kids so I have to get some supplies to feed them.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/poor-florida-neighborhood-battered-flood-tries-recover", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5116_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Garbage is piled outside the Gladiolus Food Pantry in Harlem Heights, Fla, Saturday, Oct. 1, 2022.

A real fire broke out down the street, causing confusion among residents who thought the actors were real firefighters choosing not to respond to the blaze.Charles Childs Jr., director of the funeral home where the NBC show was filming, exclusively told Fox News Digital that shortly before a suspect fired shots near the set, the cast had been practicing extinguishing a real fire while a separate incident was reported down the block.Almost as soon as the real fire was reported, authorities responded to the scene shortly after 1:45 p.m. when an \"unknown offender, armed with a  a group of people standing in the 5900 block of W.

{"title": "Iceland volcano near major airport erupts second time in a year", "body": "A volcano erupted Wednesday morning in Iceland near the capital city of Reykjavík, eight months after its last eruption ended.The Icelandic Meteorological Office (Met Office) reported on Twitter that the eruption occurred at Fagradalsfjall's Geldingadalir volcano. The volcano is located just 25 kilometers or 16 miles southwest of the country's metropolitan area.The eruption in the uninhabited valley is not far from Keflavik Airport, Iceland’s international air traffic hub. The airport was alerted as part of regular procedure during volcanic activity, but the airport remained opened, and no flights were disrupted. Additionally, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management noted that volcanic activity does not pose a threat to infrastructure or lives.The Iceland Monitor posted a livestream of the eruption on YouTube, showing magma spewing from a narrow fissure about 100 to 200 meters (109 to 218 yards) long over a field of lava from the eruption last September. Last year's eruption was the first on the Reykjanes Peninsula in more than 800 years. Scientists had anticipated an eruption somewhere on the peninsula because more than 10,000 earthquakes have been detected in the Reykjanes peninsula since Saturday, according to the Iceland Monitor. \"What we know so far is that the eruption does not pose any risk to populated areas or critical infrastructure. We will of course continue to monitor the situation closely, and now we also benefit from the experience gained from last year’s eruption,\" Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Iceland's prime minister, said in a statement.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5546_News_0>Most of the earthquakes have been smaller with a magnitude less than 4. But bigger earthquakes of 4.7 magnitude were detected since Monday. Residents in Reykjavik felt a 5.47-magnitude quake on Sunday, according to the Met Office.\"There are indications that the deformation and seismicity is declining and this was precursory to the eruption which started on 19th March 2021,\" the Met Office said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Considering all of the above, the likelihood of an eruption at Fagradalsfjall within the coming days is considered to be substantial.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5546_News_1><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5546_News_2><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5546_News_3>The 2021 eruption in the same area produced spectacular lava flows for several months that drew hundreds of thousands people.Iceland, located above a volcanic hotspot in the North Atlantic, averages an eruption every four to five years.The most disruptive in recent years was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which sent clouds of ash and dust into the atmosphere, interrupting air travel for days between Europe and North America because of concerns the ash could damage jet engines. More than 100,000 flights were grounded, stranding millions of passengers.Shares in Iceland’s flagship airline, Icelandair, rose 6% when news of the eruption broke Wednesday.

Massive flames could be seen from miles away along the coast and several homes in Laguna Niguel were seen engulfed in the fire. A state of emergency was declared for the city of Laguna Niguel Wednesday night to help provide additional resources to fight the fire.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5708_News_0><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5708_News_1><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5708_News_2><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5708_News_3><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5708_News_4>Evacuations were ordered in the Coronado Pointe and Pacific Island Drive areas.

More than 40 people remain missing and 600 schools have been hit with damages estimated at about $28 million.

It was lifted two weeks ago. After widespread corruption was uncovered by the state’s Special Investigating Unit in state funds that were supposed to help the nation respond to the coronavirus pandemic, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday that there could be \"no room for corruption, mismanagement or fraud of any sort\" in the government's response. \"Learning from the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are drawing together various stakeholders to be part of an oversight structure to ensure all funds disbursed to respond to this disaster are properly accounted for and that the state receives value for money,\" he said.Ramaphosa, who visited some of the flooded areas last week, blamed climate change for the unprecedented rains, the heaviest in at least 60 years. Notably, many South Africans are skeptical that government funds for flood relief will not be diverted by corruption.

{"title": "Crews fight New Mexico fires as some evacuations lift", "body": "Authorities have lifted some evacuation orders for a mountain community in drought-stricken southern New Mexico as firefighters worked Saturday to contain a wind-driven blaze that killed two people and destroyed over 200 homes.The evacuation orders lifted late Friday covered about 60% of the estimated 4,500 people originally ordered to leave their homes since the fire started Tuesday, but specific numbers weren't immediately available, Village of Ruidoso spokesperson Kerry Gladden told The Associated Press on Saturday. Evacuation estimates were previously reported to be around 5,000 people.\"The big story is we're in a re-population mode,\" Gladden said earlier during a media briefing.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_0>Those evacuation orders remaining in effect may be lifted in coming days, officials said.Those waiting to return included Barbara Arthur, the owner of a wooded 28-site RV park that had wind damage but didn’t burn.\"We feel blessed,\" said Arthur, who on Saturday was staying at a motel and preparing taco ingredients to take to another RV park for dinner with people displaced by the fire, including some of her tenants.Arthur said the fire came within a half-mile (0.8 kilometer) of her park and that she saw flames while evacuating. \"It’s the scariest thing I’ve ever been through in my 71 years of living,\" she said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_1><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_2>Fire incident commander Dave Bales said crews worked to put out hot spots and clear lines along the fire's perimeter to keep the fire from spreading. The fire has no containment but Bales expressed a mix of satisfaction with work done so far and prospects for coming days.Weather conditions Saturday appeared favorable with reduced wind and increased humidity, Bales said. \"We have lines in. We just want to make sure they hold in that wind,\" he said.The fire and the winds that spread it downed power lines and knocked out electricity to 18,000 customers. Electricity has been restored to all but a few dozen customers, said Wilson Guinn, a Public Service Co. manager.But people returning to their homes needed to be cautious and call utility officials if they encounter downed lines, Guinn said.\"We may have missed something,\" Guinn said. \"Don't try to touch them, fix them, roll them up, whatever.\"Gladden, the village spokesperson, said residents also need to be aware that the strong winds earlier in the week may have damaged trees that could still fall or lose limbs.\"It’s important that what started this whole event was a significant wind storm,\" she said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_3>Hotlines lit up Friday afternoon as residents reported more smoke, which fire information officer Mike De Fries said was caused by flare-ups within the interior of the fire as flames found pockets of unburned fuel.The fire started in the neighborhood and then spread to more remote areas, De Fries said Saturday. Authorities are investigating the cause.\"What you have here in Ruidoso are stretches where homes are destroyed, multiple homes are destroyed within neighborhoods,\" De Fries said. \"And then there is the clear evidence and the trail of the fire as it progressed further north and west and in some cases neighborhood to neighborhood as it burned through the Village of Ruidoso’s north and east side.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_4>Authorities have yet to release the names of the couple who died. Their bodies were found after worried family members contacted police, saying the couple had planned to evacuate Tuesday when the fire exploded but were unaccounted for later that day.As of Saturday, the fire had burned 9.6 square miles (25 square kilometers) of timber and brush.Hotter and drier weather coupled with decades of fire suppression have contributed to an increase in the number of acres burned by wildfires, fire scientists say. The problem is exacerbated by a more than 20-year Western megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change.There are other blazes in the state, including the smaller Nogal Canyon fire to the northwest of Ruidoso. That fire was caused by downed power lines, De Fries said, and has burned six homes and eight outbuildings. People have been ordered to leave the area.\"We are right now in a time, even though it’s very early in the year, where places like New Mexico have had extra stretches of just extremely dry weather,\" De Fries said. \"Combining that with some winds, and you can see by the number of fires that are taking place and number of new starts every day and each week that fire conditions are a big concern.\"Ruidoso a decade ago was the site of the most destructive wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history when more than 240 homes burned and nearly 70 square miles (181 square kilometers) of forest were blackened by a lightning-sparked blaze.While many older residents call Ruidoso home year round, the population of about 8,000 people expands to about 25,000 during the summer months as Texans and New Mexicans from hotter climates seek respite.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/crews-fight-new-mexico-fires-evacuations-lift", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The remains of a home left after a wildfire spread through the Village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/AP22103769309801.jpg"}, {"caption": "The remains of a home left after a wildfire spread through the Village of Ruidoso, N.M. on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/AP22103769289003.jpg"}, {"caption": "Fire burns along a hillside in the Village of Ruidoso, N.M., on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/fe188320-AP22103769247875.jpg"}, {"caption": "Smoke rises along a hillside in the Village of Ruidoso, N.M., on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/AP22103769226691.jpg"}, {"caption": "This photo provided by the Village of Ruidoso shows a fire fighting air tanker dropping fire retardant across the mountains near the Village of Ruidoso, N.M., on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5742_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/AP22103738101571-1.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Major outage hits Puerto Rico, shuttering schools and offices", "body": "More than a million customers in Puerto Rico remained without electricity on Thursday after a fire at a main power plant caused the biggest blackout so far this year across the U.S. territory, forcing it to cancel classes and shutter government offices.The blackout also left some 160,000 customers without water and snarled traffic across the island of 3.2 million people, where the roar of generators and smell of diesel filled the air. Those who could not afford generators and have medical conditions such as diabetes, which depends on refrigerated insulin, worried about how much longer they’d be without power.Long lines formed at some gas stations as people sought fuel for generators. Others tried to charge their cellphones at businesses in scenes reminiscent of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which struck as a Category 4 storm in 2017.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5755_News_0>Officials in at least one city distributed food to hundreds of elderly people as well as ice to those whose medication must be kept cool.\"This is horrible,\" said Luisa Rosado, a mother of two who lives in the San Juan neighborhood of Río Piedras.She said she and her husband had sacrificed their savings to install a solar electricity system at their home after Hurricane Maria, which left them with at least partial power following the blackout.She said her neighbors had been outraged by recent increases in power bills, which were already higher than in most U.S. states. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5755_News_1>\"To increase bills when you don’t provide a perfect service ... the level of impunity is absurd,\" Rosado said.Luma, the company that took over transmission and distribution from Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority last year, said the blackout could have been caused by a circuit-breaker failure at the Costa Sur generation plant — one of four main plants on the island.\"The system is being restored little by little,\" said Kevin Acevedo, a vice president of Luma, adding that the company is trying to complete the work within 24 hours. \"The people of Puerto Rico have to understand that it’s a system with a lot of years. Bringing back Puerto Rico’s system is a delicate and complicated process.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5755_News_2>Luma said the exact cause of the interruption is unknown.\"It’s going to require an exhaustive investigation,\" Acevedo said, adding that that the equipment whose failure sparked the fire had been properly maintained.Officials said at least three generation units were back online by Thursday, with crews working to restore more.Luma CEO Wayne Stensby called it a \"very unusual\" outage that \"clearly indicates the fragility of the system.\"The outage occurred two months before the Atlantic hurricane season starts, worrying many about the condition of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid.\"Yes, the system is fragile, no one is denying that, but we’re prepared,\" Acevedo said.Police officers were stationed at main intersections to help direct traffic on Thursday while health officials checked in at hospitals to ensure generators were still running.The outage further enraged Puerto Ricans already frustrated with an electricity system razed by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Emergency repairs were made at the time, but reconstruction efforts have not yet started, and power company officials blame aging, ill-maintained infrastructure for the ongoing outages.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5755_News_3>A series of strong earthquakes that struck southern Puerto Rico where the Costa Sur plant is located also had damaged it.The Electric Power Authority also is trying to restructure $9 billion worth of public debt to emerge from a lengthy bankruptcy.

{"title": "China Eastern crash: Wallets, IDs but no survivors found", "body": "Mud-stained wallets. Bank cards. Official identity cards. Poignant reminders of 132 lives presumed lost were lined up by rescue workers scouring a remote Chinese mountainside Tuesday for the wreckage of a China Eastern flight that one day earlier inexplicably fell from the sky and burst into a huge fireball.No survivors have been found among the 123 passengers and nine crew members. Video clips posted by China's state media show small pieces of the Boeing 737-800 plane scattered over a wide forested area, some in green fields, others in burnt-out patches with raw earth exposed after fires burned in the trees. Each piece of debris has a number next to it, the larger ones marked off by police tape.As family members gathered at the destination and departure airports, what caused the plane to drop out of the sky shortly before it would have begun its descent to the southern China metropolis of Guangzhou remained a mystery. The search for the black boxes, which hold the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, would be difficult, the official Xinhua News Agency said, and involve drones and manual searching.The crash left a deep pit in the mountainside, Xinhua said, citing rescuers. Chen Weihao, who saw the falling plane while working on a farm, told the news agency it hit a gap in the mountain where nobody lived.\"The plane looked to be in one piece when it nosedived. Within seconds, it crashed,\" Chen said.China Eastern flight 5735 crashed outside the city of Wuzhou in the Guangxi region while flying from Kunming, the capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, to Guangzhou, an industrial center not far from Hong Kong on China’s southeastern coast. It ignited a fire big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images before firefighters could extinguish it.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5781_News_0>No foreigners were on board the lost flight, the Foreign Ministry said, citing a preliminary review.Dinglong Culture, a Guangzhou company in both mining and TV and movie production, said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange that its CFO, Fang Fang, was a passenger. Zhongxinghua, an accounting firm used by Dinglong, said that two of its employees were also on the flight.The crash site is surrounded on three sides by mountains and accessible only by foot and motorcycle on a steep dirt road in the semitropical Guangxi region, famed for some of China’s most spectacular scenery.Rain fell Tuesday afternoon as excavators dug out a path to make access easier, state broadcaster CCTV said. The steepness of the slope made the positioning of heavy equipment difficult.A base of operations was set up near the crash site with rescue vehicles, ambulances and an emergency power supply truck parked in the narrow space. Soldiers and rescue workers combed the charred crash site and surrounding heavily dense vegetation.Police restricted access, checking each vehicle entering Molang, a village near the crash site. Five people with swollen eyes walked out of the village, got into a car and left. Onlookers said they were relatives of the passengers.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5781_News_1>Family members gathered at Kunming and Guangzhou airports. People draped in pink blankets and slumped in massage chairs could be seen in a traveler rest area in the basement of the one in Kunming. Workers wheeled in mattresses and brought bagged meals. A security guard blocked an AP journalist from entering, saying that \"interviews aren’t being accepted.\"In Guangzhou, relatives were escorted to a reception center staffed by employees wearing full protective gear to guard against the coronavirus.At least five hotels with more than 700 rooms had been requisitioned in Wuzhou's Teng county for family members, Chinese media reported.Workers in hazmat suits set up a registration desk and administered COVID-19 tests at the entrance to one hotel, outside of Molang. A sign read, \"The hotel is requisitioned for March 21 plane accident emergency use.\" At another hotel, a group of women, some wearing vests with Red Cross markings, registered at a hotel desk set up outside.The nation's first fatal plane crash in more than a decade dominated China's news and social media. World leaders including Great Britain's Boris Johnson, India's Narendra Modi and Canada's Justin Trudeau posted condolences on Twitter.Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said that the company was deeply saddened by the news and had offered the full support of its technical experts to assist in the investigation.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5781_News_2>\"The thoughts of all of us at Boeing are with the passengers and crew members ... as well as their families and loved ones,\" he wrote in a message to Boeing employees.The plane was about an hour into its flight, at an altitude of 29,000 feet (8,840 meters), when it entered a steep, fast dive around 2:20 p.m., according to data from FlightRadar24.com. The plane plunged to 7,400 feet before briefly regaining about 1,200 feet in altitude, then dove again. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds after starting to dive.The aircraft was delivered to the airline in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years.Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, where the flight was headed, is one of China’s main aviation hubs. It is the home base for China Southern Airlines. As the pandemic upended air travel, it rocketed past Beijing and Atlanta to claim the title of world’s busiest airport in 2020 — the most recent year for which annual data is available — handling more than 43 million passengers.Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, home to export-driven factories making smartphones, toys, furniture and other goods. Its Auto City district has joint ventures operated by Toyota, Nissan and others. Kunming, the departure city which is 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) west, is the capital of Yunnan province, an agricultural, mining and tourism center that borders Southeast Asia.China Eastern, which is headquartered in Shanghai, has grounded all of its 737-800s, China’s Transport Ministry said. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5781_News_3>The airline is one of China's three largest carriers with more than 600 planes, including 109 Boeing 737-800s. The grounding could further disrupt domestic air travel already curtailed because of the largest COVID-19 outbreak in China since the initial peak in early 2020.The Boeing 737-800 has been flying since 1998 and has an excellent safety record, said Hassan Shahidi, president of the Flight Safety Foundation. It is an earlier model than the 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide for nearly two years after deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.Before Monday, the last fatal crash of a Chinese airliner occurred in August 2010, when an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines hit the ground short of the runway in the northeastern city of Yichun and caught fire.

{"title": "NYC building where fire killed 17 skipped inspection after officers were moved to COVID unit: report", "body": "The Bronx, New York City, building where 17 people – including eight children – died in a blaze earlier this year was due to receive a fire inspection before the tragedy, but never did because those tasked with examining the structure were reassigned to a unit that checked that restaurants were following COVID restrictions, according to a report. Oren Barzilay, president of Local 2507, the union that represents uniformed emergency medical technicians, paramedics and fire inspectors, testified last week before the City Council’s Fire and Emergency Management Committee.\"That building was scheduled to be inspected, but because they were sent to a task force, that building was not inspected,\" he said, according to the New York Daily News. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_0><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_1><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_2>Fire Department of New York Deputy Chief Inspector Michael Reardon testified that approximately 90 fire inspectors were transferred to different roles related to COVID policies, such as making sure that restaurants are following vaccine mandate requirements, according to the report. \"They were downsized to the point that some units were unable to do all the inspections they needed to do,\" Reardon reportedly said. Seventeen people died – nine adults and eight children – on Jan. 9 when the fire broke out at a 19-story building at 333 East 181st St. in the Fordham Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, officials said. About 200 firefighters responded and more than 60 people were hurt, authorities said. Initial reports said 19 people were killed in the fire. Authorities later modified the death toll to 17.Fire officials said the blaze was caused by an \"accidental, malfunctioning space heater.\" The fire, which started on the second and third floors, was then exacerbated by open doors in part of the building, which allowed the fire and smoke to spread throughout it.The building was outfitted with self-shutting doors, but they didn't close properly, causing the smoke to permeate. An inspector was supposed to visit the building to check its stand pipe system about a year before the fire, Barzilay told the Daily News. While he or she would not have been primarily checking the doorways, an inspector would typically make note of any issues they come across, such as malfunctioning doors, the report says.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_3>\"If they had noticed anything else, they would have addressed the issue,\" he told the News.He reportedly called the circumstances \"terrible\" and said he was not blaming current Mayor Eric Adams. \"I’m blaming the previous administration for not thinking it through,\" he told the News. Adams addressed the topic during an unrelated press conference over the weekend, telling reporters that his administration changed the policy as soon as they learned of it. He noted that an inspection would likely not have prevented the dangerous circumstances related to the fire, because inspectors examine external portions of buildings – meaning hallways and public areas – not the actual apartments.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/nyc-fire-17-was-skipped-inspection-officers-covid-unit", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The Jan. 9 fire in the Bronx left 17 people dead, dozens more injured.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/bronx-fire-thumb-9.jpg"}, {"caption": "About 200 firefighters responded and more than 60 people were hurt, authorities said.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/bronx-fire-thumb-6.jpg"}, {"caption": "The fire broke out at a 19-story building in the Fordham Heights neighborhood of the Bronx.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/bronx-fire-thumb-7.jpg"}, {"caption": "Bronx fire leaves 17 dead, dozens more injured.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_5801_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/bronx-fire-thumb-10.jpg"}]}

The suffocating smoke rose through a stairwell of the 19-story building and killed people as they attempted to flee.\"These Black families who lost so much that seem to be marginalized not only before the tragic fire broke out, but even in the aftermath,\" Crump said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5877_News_1><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5877_News_2>Several relatives of the fire victims spoke at the news conference to express frustration over the uncertainties spawned by the fire as they look for new places to live.

She was trying to come down to save my family,\" said Fatima Janneh, whose sister Sera, 27, was among those killed.\"We need justice for the families that lost people, as well as the other tenants in the building.

A second door left open in a stairwell higher up acted as a flue, sucking smoke upward.Fire investigators said that the apartment’s front door and a door on the 15th floor should have been self-closing to help contain the spreading smoke, but that the doors stayed fully open.

{"title": "Bronx apartment building fire kills multiple people, including children, firefighters among injured", "body": "Firefighters on empty air tanks pushed through the smoke of a fire that swept through a Bronx high-rise apartment Sunday morning, killing nearly 20 people, including at least nine children, and injuring dozens of others.A fire official told Fox News there were more than 60 injuries in total, with more than half of those seriously injured. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_0>Four firefighters were among those injured. One of them was seriously injured, though none of their injuries is life-threatening, the fire official said. Speaking at a Sunday evening press conference, Mayor Eric Adams said the firefighters' compressed air tanks were empty but \"they still pushed through the smoke.\" \"You can't do this if you don't feel attached to this city and this community,\" Adams said. \"I really want to thank them for putting the lives on the line to save lives.\" Adams, joined by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the fire stemmed from a faulty space heater in one of the apartments. FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said the fire spanned the second and third floors of the 19-story building. The door of the apartment was left open, allowing smoke to quickly spread throughout the building.\"The smoke conditions in this building are unprecedented,\" Nigro added, calling it one of the worst blazes in the city in recent memory. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_1>Adams said many of the building's residents were immigrants from the West African nation of Gambia and were Muslim. Gov. Hochul said her administration would establish a victim's compensation to help with housing and burial funds. \"Approximately 200 FDNY members are operating on scene of a 5-alarm fire at 333 East 181 Street in the Bronx,\" the New York City Fire Department tweeted earlier Sunday, adding that there were more than 30 \"serious injuries to civilians.\"  Smoke inhalation was the cause for the injuries and no one was burned, according to authorities.  The fire started on the second and third floors of the building in a duplex apartment in the Tremont section of the Bronx, the New York Times reported. The fire began just before 11 a.m. Photos posted online showed a rescue ladder extended up to an eighth-floor window. More than 30 people were transported to five hospitals, with the majority of victims suffering from severe smoke inhalation, Nigro said.  Nigro compared the severity of the fire to the Happy Land social club fire, which killed 87 people in 1990 when a man set fire to the building after getting into an argument with his former girlfriend and being thrown out of the club.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_2><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_3><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_4><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_5><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_6><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_7><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_8><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5907_News_9>According to Nigro, Sunday's fire originated in a duplex apartment spanning the second and third floors.

As firefighters struggled to tame the blaze, a dark plume of smoke and flames rose high into the air above the southern city of Cape Town.Around 70 firefighters were still battling the fire more than seven hours after it started in the early morning, Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Jermaine Carelse said. Some of them were lifted on a crane to spray water on the blaze from above. No injuries have been reported and Parliament itself had been closed for the holidays.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5927_News_0>Visiting the scene, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said a person was \"being held and is being questioned\" by police in connection with the blaze.\"The fire is currently in the National Assembly chambers,\" Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure Patricia de Lille told reporters as smoke billowed behind her from the roof of the historic white building with grand entrance columns. \"This is a very sad day for democracy, for Parliament is the home of our democracy.\"\"We have not been able to contain the fire in the National Assembly,\" she added. \"Part of the ceilings have collapsed.\"J.P. Smith, the Cape Town official in charge of safety and security, said at least one floor of the Parliamentary office building was \"gutted\" and its entire roof had collapsed. The firefighters were now focusing their efforts on saving the National Assembly building, where South Africa's parliament sits, he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_5927_News_1>Carelse warned that buildings were at risk of collapsing and historical artifacts inside were likely to be damaged or destroyed.\"The bitumen on the roof is even melting, an indication of the intense heat. There have been reports of some walls showing cracks, which could indicate a collapse,\" News24 website quoted Carelse as saying.Security guards first reported the fire at around 6 a.m., Carelse said, and the 35 firefighters initially on the scene had to call for reinforcements. Cape Town activated its Disaster Coordinating Team, which reacts to major emergencies. Police cordoned off the complex and closed nearby roads.The precinct has three main sections, the original Parliament building completed in the late 1800s and two newer parts built in the 20th century.

There's just nothing left.\"Repairing homes will be a long process, but Chaisson said Wednesday that the local government is focused for now on restoring power and drinkable water, as well as ensuring people have food and basic supplies. \"All of our pod sites, or points of distribution, were opened yesterday,\" Chaisson said. \"People are getting tarps and water and MREs. We hope to open our fifth pod tomorrow.\"Rep. Steve Scalise, a Republican who represents much of Lafourche Parish, met with Chaisson and other officials on Wednesday to discuss how the state and federal governments can best assist the community in recovering from the storm. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6124_News_3><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6124_News_4><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6124_News_5>Port Fourchon, which is responsible for about 90% of the oil and gas production in the Gulf, took a direct hit when Hurricane Ida came onshore with 150+ mph winds.

{"title": "22 dead, many missing after 17 inches of rain in Tennessee", "body": "WAVERLY, Tenn. — At least 22 people were killed and rescue crews searched desperately Sunday amid shattered homes and tangled debris for dozens of people still missing after record-breaking rain sent floodwaters surging through Middle Tennessee.Saturday’s flooding in rural areas took out roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines, leaving families uncertain about whether their loved ones survived the unprecedented deluge. Emergency workers were searching door to door, said Kristi Brown, a coordinator for health and safety supervisor with Humphreys County Schools.Many of the missing live in the neighborhoods where the water rose the fastest, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said. Their names were on a board in the county’s emergency center and listed on a city department’s Facebook page.The dead included twin toddlers who were swept from their father’s arms, according to surviving family members. The sheriff of the county of about 18,000 people some 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Nashville said he lost one of his best friends.Up to 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain fell in Humphreys County in less than 24 hours Saturday, appearing to shatter the Tennessee record for one-day rainfall by more than 3 inches (8 centimeters), the National Weather Service said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6172_News_0>Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee toured the area, stopping on Main Street in Waverly where some homes were washed off their foundations and people were sifting though their water-logged possessions.Shirley Foster cried as the governor walked up. She said she just learned a friend from her church was dead.\"I thought I was over the shock of all this. I’m just tore up over my friend. My house is nothing, but my friend is gone,\" Foster told the governor.The hardest-hit areas saw double the rain that area of Middle Tennessee had in the previous worst-case scenario for flooding, meteorologists said. Lines of storms moved over the area for hours, wringing out a record amount of moisture — a scenario scientists have warned may be more common because of global warming.The downpours rapidly turned the creeks that run behind backyards and through downtown Waverly into raging rapids. Business owner Kansas Klein stood on a bridge Saturday in the town of 4,500 people and saw two girls who were holding on to a puppy and clinging to a wooden board sweep past, the current too fast for anyone to grab them.He isn’t sure what happened to them. Klein heard that a girl and a puppy had been rescued downstream, and that another girl was also saved, but he wasn’t sure it was them.By Sunday, the floodwaters were gone, leaving behind debris from wrecked cars, demolished businesses and homes and a chaotic, tangled mix of the things inside.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6172_News_1><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6172_News_2><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6172_News_3>\"It was amazing how quick it came and how quick it left,\" Klein said.The Humphreys County Sheriff Office Facebook page filled with people looking for missing friends and family. GoFundMe pages were made asking for help for funeral expenses for the dead, including 7-month-old twins yanked from their father’s arms as they tried to escape.Not far from the bridge, Klein told The Associated Press by phone that dozens of buildings in a low-income housing area known as Brookside appeared to have borne the brunt of the flash flood from Trent Creek.\"It was devastating: buildings were knocked down, half of them were destroyed,\" Klein said. \"People were pulling out bodies of people who had drowned and didn’t make it out.\"At the Cash Saver grocery in in Waverly, employees stood on desks, registers and a flower rack as the waters from the creek that’s usually 400 feet (120 meters) from the store rushed in after devastating the low income housing next door. At one point, they tried to break through the celling into the attic and couldn’t, store co-owner David Hensley said.The flood waters stopped rising as fast just as the situation was getting dire and a rescue boat came by. \"We told him that if there’s somebody else out there you can get, go get them, we think we’re OK,\" Hensley said.Just to the east of Waverly, the town of McEwen was pummeled Saturday with 17.02 inches (43.2 centimeters) of rain, smashing the state’s 24-hour record of 13.6 inches (34.5 centimeters) from 1982, according to the National Weather Service in Nashville, though Saturday’s numbers would have to be confirmed.A flash flood watch was issued for the area before the rain started, with forecasters saying 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rain was possible. The worst storm recorded in this area of Middle Tennessee only dropped 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, said Krissy Hurley, a weather service meteorologist in Nashville.\"Forecasting almost a record is something we don’t do very often,\" Hurley said. \"Double the amount we’ve ever seen was almost unfathomable.\"Recent scientific research has determined that extreme rain events will become more frequent because of man-made climate change. Hurley said it is impossible to know its exact role in Saturday’s flood, but noted in the past year her office dealt with floods that used to be expected maybe once every 100 years in September south of Nashville and in March closer to the city.\"We had an incredible amount of water in the atmosphere,\" Hurley said of Saturday’s flooding. \"Thunderstorms developed and moved across the same area over and over and over.\"The problem isn’t limited to Tennessee. A federal study found man-made climate change doubles the chances of the types of heavy downpours that in August 2016 dumped 26 inches (66 centimeters) of rain around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Those floods killed at least 13 people and damaged 150,000 homes.___Collins contributed to this report from Columbia, South Carolina.

{"title": "Haiti quake death toll rises to 1,419, injured now at 6,000", "body": "LES CAYES, Haiti — Rescuers and scrap metal scavengers dug into the floors of a collapsed hotel Monday in this quake-ravaged coastal town, where 15 bodies had already been extracted. Jean Moise Fortunè, whose brother, the hotel owner, was killed in the quake, believed there were more people trapped in the rubble.But based on the size of voids that workers cautiously peered into, perhaps a foot (0.3 meters) in depth, finding survivors appeared unlikely.The quake, centered about 125 kilometers (80 miles) west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, killed at least 1,419 people, nearly razing some towns and triggering landslides that hampered rescue efforts in a country that is the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. Haiti already was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, gang violence, worsening poverty and the political uncertainty following the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse when the quake struck Saturday.The Caribbean nation's Civil Protection agency on Monday also raised the number of injured to 6,000. And the devastation could soon worsen with the coming of Tropical Depression Grace, predicted to reach Haiti on Monday night with strong winds, heavy rain, mudslides and flash flooding. Rainfall could reach 15 inches (38 centimeters) in some areas, the agency said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6192_News_0>\"We are working now to ensure that the resources we have are going to get to the places that are hardest hit,\" said agency head Jerry Chandler, referring to the provinces of Cayes, Jeremie and Nippe, which are in the country’s southwestern portion.As work, fuel and money ran out, desperate Les Cayes residents searched collapsed houses for scrap metal to sell. Others waited for money wired from abroad, a mainstay of Haiti’s economy even before the quake.Anthony Emile waited six hours in a line with dozens of others trying to get money his brother had wired from Chile, where he has worked since Haiti’s last quake.\"We have been waiting since morning for it, but there are too many people,\" said Emile, a banana farmer who said relatives in the countryside depend on him giving them money to survive.Injured earthquake victims continued to stream into Les Cayes’ overwhelmed general hospital, three days after the earthquake struck. Patients waited to be treated on stair steps, in corridors and the hospital’s open veranda.\"After two days, they are almost always generally infected,\" said Dr. Paurus Michelete, who had treated 250 patients and was one of only three doctors on call when the quake hit.The magnitude 7.2 earthquake displaced thousands of people from destroyed or damaged homes. Les Cayes was darkened by intermittent blackouts, and many people slept outside, clutching transistor radios tuned to news, terrified of the continuing aftershocks.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6192_News_1>Efforts to treat the injured were difficult at the hospital, where Michelete said pain killers, analgesics and steel pins to mend fractures were running out amid the crush of patients.\"We are saturated, and people keep coming,\" he said.Josil Eliophane, 84, crouched on the steps of the hospital, clutching an X-ray showing his shattered arm bone and pleading for pain medication.Michelete said he would give one of his few remaining shots to Eliophane, who ran out of his house as the quake hit, only to have a wall fall on him.Nearby, on the hospital’s open-air veranda, patients were on beds and mattresses, hooked up to IV bags of saline fluid. Others lay in the garden under bed sheets erected to shield them from the brutal sun. None of the patients or relatives caring for them wore face masks amid a coronavirus surge.Officials said more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged from the quake, leaving some 30,000 families homeless. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches also were destroyed or badly damaged.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6192_News_2>Underlining the dire conditions, local officials had to negotiate with gangs in the seaside district of Martissant to allow two humanitarian convoys a day to pass through the area, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported. The agency called Haiti’s southern peninsula a \"hot spot for gang-related violence,\" where humanitarian workers have been repeatedly attacked.The agency said the area has been \"virtually unreachable\" over the past two months because of road blocks and security concerns. Agency spokeswoman Anna Jefferys said the first convoy passed through Sunday with government and U.N. personnel. and the U.N. World Food Program plans to send in food supplies via trucks Tuesday.Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said the first government aid convoys had started moving help to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed.UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said humanitarian needs were acute, with many Haitians urgently needing health care, clean water and shelter. Children separated from their parents also needed protection, she said.\"Little more than a decade on, Haiti is reeling once again,\" Fore said, referring to the 2010 earthquake that ravaged Haiti’s capital, killing tens of thousands. \"And this disaster coincides with political instability, rising gang violence, alarmingly high rates of malnutrition among children, and the COVID-19 pandemic — for which Haiti has received just 500,000 vaccine doses, despite requiring far more.\"The country of 11 million people received its first batch of U.S.-donated coronavirus vaccines only last month via a United Nations program for low-income countries.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6192_News_3>Medical workers from across the region were scrambling to help as hospitals in Les Cayes started running out of space to perform surgeries.\"Basically, they need everything,\" said Dr. Inobert Pierre, a pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which oversees St. Boniface Hospital, about two hours from Les Cayes.Pierre’s medical team was taking some patients to St. Boniface to undergo surgery, but with just two ambulances, they could transport only four at a time.Working with USAID, the U.S. Coast Guard said a helicopter was transporting medical personnel from the Haitian capital to the quake zone and evacuating injured back to Port-au-Prince. Lt. Commander Jason Nieman, a spokesman, said other aircraft and ships were being sent.At the Les Cayes hospital, Emma Cadet, 41, a carpenter’s wife, hovered over her 18-year-old son, Charles Owen, as he awaited an operation on his broken arm. He was among the lucky patients to have received pain medication.Worse off was Nerison Vendredi, 19, lying quiet but alert. No casts or splint would help her because she apparently had suffered internal injuries and could not move.There were some stories of miracle survivals, but they were becoming fewer as the days passed.Jacquelion Luxama was leading his goats to a watering hole Saturday when a hillside collapsed on him, trapping him amid boulders and a rockslide that stripped skin from his hip.\"I started yelling, and luckily some other famers heard me, and they came and pulled me out, \" said Luxama, lying on a mattress at the Les Cayes hospital.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/haiti-quake-death-toll-rises", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6192_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A man walks on a collapsed building in Saint-Louis-du-Sud, Haiti, Monday, Aug. 16, 2021, two days after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck the southwestern part of the hemisphere's poorest nation on Aug. 14.(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6192_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/08/30045afb-AP21228449564264.jpg"}, {"caption": "People watch a bulldozer remove debris at the collapsed Le Manguier hotel in Les Cayes, Haiti, Monday, Aug. 16, 2021, two days after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck the southwestern part of the country.

The 7.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Saturday took the lives of 1,297 people, with at least 5,700 more people injured. The devastation has already strained the island, with survivors in some areas forced to wait outside amid oppressive heat as hospitals remained overloaded. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6193_News_0>The situation could grow more severe now that Grace has made landfall: The National Hurricane Center warned that despite Grace weakening from a tropical storm to a tropical depression, it still posed a threat. A tropical storm watch remains in effect for the island of Hispaniola, which contains the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Thousands of residents and vacationers in areas where fires broke out days ago have fled by land and by sea.In apocalyptic scenes overnight and into Saturday morning, ferries evacuated 1,153 people from a seaside village and beaches on Evia, an island of rugged, forested mountains popular with vacationers and campers, after approaching flames cut off all other means of escape.

The park, one of the last remaining substantial forests near Athens, still bears deep scars from wildfires in 2007.The 38-year-old volunteer firefighter who died Friday had suffered head injuries after being struck by a falling power pole north of Athens.

One is hitched to a river and growing; the other is disconnected and dying.Scientists from NASA and a half-dozen universities from Boston to California aim to create computer models that can be used with satellite data to let countries around the world learn which parts of their dwindling deltas can be shored up and which are past hope.\"If you have to choose between saving an area and losing another instead of losing everything, you want to know where to put your resources to work to save the livelihood of all the people who live there,\" said lead scientist Marc Simard of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.While oceans rise because of climate change, the world's river deltas — home to seafood nurseries and more than 300 million people -- are sinking and shrinking.To figure out where to shore up dying deltas, NASA is studying water flowing in and out of Louisiana's Atchafalaya and Terrebonne basins, sediment carried by it, and plants that can slow the flow, trap sediment and pull carbon from the air.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6286_News_0>Louisiana holds 40% of the nation’s wetlands, but they’re disappearing fast -- about 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of the state have been lost since the 1930s. That’s about 80% of the nation’s wetland losses, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Using two kinds of radar and a spectrometer that measures more colors than the human eye can distinguish, high-altitude NASA airplanes have been collecting information such as water height, slope, sediment, and the types and density of plants. Some measurements are as precise as a couple of centimeters (less than an inch).On boats and islands, scientists and students from across the country take samples and measure everything from currents to diameters of trees. Their findings will be used to calibrate the airborne instruments.\"I’ve been working here 15 years, and one of the toughest parts about working in a delta is you can only touch one little piece of it at any one time and understand one little piece of it at one time,\" said Robert Twilley, a professor of oceanography and coastal sciences at Louisiana State University. \"Now we have the capability of working with NASA to understand the entire delta.\"The Mississippi River drains 41% of the continental United States, collecting 150 million tons (130 million metric tons) of sediment per year. But, largely because of flood-prevention levees, most sediment shoots into the Gulf of Mexico rather than settling in wetlands.\"Deltas are the babies of the geological timescale. They are very young and fragile, in a delicate balance of sinking and growing,\" NASA states on the Delta-X project website.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6286_News_1>In geological time, young means thousands of years. On that scale, Louisiana's Wax Lake Delta is taking its first breaths. It dates to 1942, when the Army Corps of Engineers dug an outlet from the lake to reduce flood threats to Morgan City, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Sediment from the Atchafalaya River filled the lake, then began creating islands in the Gulf.The new islands are thick with black willows and, in spring, thigh-high butterweed topped with small yellow flowers.Older wetlands in areas surveyed by Delta-X aircraft are more diverse, their soil rich with humus from generations of plants. Along nearby Hog Bayou, blue buntings and scarlet tanagers dart through magnolia branches and skinks skitter up trees. In swamps, ospreys nest atop bald cypresses and alligators float in the water below.In addition to working at LSU, Twilley has spent about nine years as executive director of Louisiana Sea Grant College Program, which uses the Wax Lake Delta as a classroom for middle- and high-school students.\"We take kids and make them stand on land that was formed the year they were born.\" Twilley said.In contrast, the adjacent Terrebonne Basin is shrinking so rapidly that the government is paying to move the Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians from a vanishing island to higher ground.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6286_News_2>That band isn't the only Native American group losing ground.\"The wooded areas we used to run through as children -- they’re dead,\" said Chief Shirell Parfait-Dardar of the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha Indians, based less than 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the Wax Lake Delta.\"Ghost forests\" are common in degrading deltas where salt water intrudes as land sinks and erodes, LSU's Twilley said.Louisiana is considering two projects that would divert Atchafalaya River sediment to build land in the Terrebonne Basin, but a decision is more than a year away, according to the state Coastal Restoration and Preservation Authority.Delta-X's study gets downright granular. A California Institute of Technology team that studies how sediment moves and is deposited on Earth and other planets will analyze the amounts of sediment in high- and low-tide water samples, breaking the particles down into about 100 sizes.One way LSU researchers measure how much land has been formed by sediment involves sprinkling white feldspar dust on the ground.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6286_News_3>They return to see how deeply it's buried by new sediment. They do that by injecting liquid nitrogen into hollow tubes to freeze the dirt and muck around them. When the tubes are pulled up, the frozen \"popsicles\" show a white ring. They measure from there to the top.In the Terrebonne Basin, such sedimentation can't keep up with subsidence and sea level rise. \"Thus the wetlands basically drown,\" Twilley said.Planes and boats went out in March and April and will go out again in fall for a second set of measurements. And two international satellites are scheduled for launch next year, each carrying one of the two kinds of radar used over Louisiana.  To gauge how plants affect water movement, long-wavelengths of L-band radar can measure water level changes in open and vegetated channels, NASA's Simard said. And high-frequency Ka-band radar can measure surface height of open water, showing how it slopes -- and where it’s moving.\"All of the tools they’re bringing to bear is really impressive,\" said Indiana University sedimentary geologist Douglas Edmonds, who is not part of the project but has worked with many of the researchers.\"The project itself is putting a finger on a really essential question for a lot of deltas around the world -- how this deltaic land is formed and what processes take it away,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//science/nasa-studies-louisiana-delta-system-in-effort-to-combat-global-climate-change", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6286_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Hog Bayou, part of the Wax Lake Delta in the Atchafalaya Basin, is seen from a plane in St. Mary Parish, La., Tuesday, May 25, 2021.

{"title": "Taiwan train crash: At least 48 killed in deadliest rail disaster in country's history", "body": "Rescue crews in Taiwan are responding Friday to a train derailment on its scenic east coast that killed at least 48 people and prompted dozens of passengers to crawl out of windows to safety, reports say. The rail disaster – which officials are calling the deadliest of its kind in Taiwan’s history – happened after a train carrying more than 400 people collided with an unmanned vehicle that had rolled down a hill. The train had only partially emerged from a tunnel at the time of the incident and more than 100 people have been confirmed injured, the National Fire Service added. \"Many people were crushed under train seats in the collision. And there were other people on top of the seats. So those at the bottom were pressed and crushed and lost consciousness,\" a passenger with gauze taped to her elbow told Taiwanese broadcaster EBC, which did not show her face or give her name. \"At the beginning, they still responded when we called them. But I guess they lost consciousness afterward.\" <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6387_News_0><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6387_News_1><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6387_News_2>The train derailed near the Taroko Gorge scenic area on the first day of a long holiday weekend when many people were using Taiwan's extensive rail system. The National Fire Service confirmed the death toll, which included the train's young, newly married driver, and said all aboard had now been accounted for. Railways news officer Weng Hui-ping called the crash Taiwan’s deadliest rail disaster. Weng said a construction truck operated by the railway administration slid onto the track from a worksite on the hillside above. No one was in the truck at the time. He said the speed of the train was not known. With most of the train still inside the tunnel at the time of the collision, many escaping passengers were forced to scramble out of doors and windows and scale the sides of the train to walk along the roof to safety. Weng said earlier that emergency personnel had been searching wrecked cars for \"several people\" who may be stuck in awkward places. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6387_News_3>The stretch of track where the orange-striped train came to a halt hugs the coastline. Yellow and red police tape marked the area of the crash, where tents had been set up and dozens of rescuers and officials had converged. Taiwan is a mountainous island, and most of its 24 million people live in the flatlands along the northern and western coasts that are home to most of the island’s farmland, biggest cities and high-tech industries. The lightly populated east is popular with tourists, many of whom travel there by train to avoid mountain roads. An investigation has been launched into the crash, and there was no immediate word about any arrests. In a tweet, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said emergency services \"have been fully mobilized to rescue & assist the passengers & railway staff affected. We will continue to do everything we can to ensure their safety in the wake of this heartbreaking incident.\" The crash came on the first day of the four-day Tomb Sweeping Festival, an annual religious holiday when people travel to their hometowns for family gatherings and to pay their respects at the graves of their ancestors. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6387_News_4>Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang said the Railways Administration would be required to immediately conduct checks along other track lines to \"prevent this from happening again.\" About 50 volunteers from the Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation stationed at an aid tent near the crash site said children were among the dozens who escaped the train cars. They were treating minor wounds and offering lunches. \"We see people coming off the train and they look shaken and nervous,\" said Chen Tzu-chong, a Tzu Chi team leader on site. Taiwan's last major rail crash was in October 2018, when an express train derailed while rounding a tight corner on the northeast coast, killing at least 18 people and injuring nearly 200. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6387_News_5>In 1991, a collision in western Taiwan killed 30 people and another crash a decade earlier also killed 30. Those were said to be the worst previous crashes on the rail system that dates from the late 19th century. Taiwan's extensive rail system has undergone substantial upgrades in recent years, particularly with the addition of a high-speed line connecting the capital Taipei with west coast cities to the south.

{"title": "Thousands flee Burma airstrikes, complicating crisis", "body": "A series of airstrikes by Burma's military along the country's border raised concerns Monday that more villagers might flee to neighboring Thailand in large numbers, adding a new dimension to an already volatile crisis.The strikes in areas populated predominantly by ethnic Karen people represent another escalation in the increasingly violent crackdown by Burma's junta on protests of its Feb. 1 coup. On Saturday, more than 100 people were killed in and around demonstrations throughout the country — the bloodiest single day since the takeover.Burmese aircraft carried out three strikes overnight Sunday, according to Dave Eubank, a member of the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian relief agency that delivers medical and other assistance to villagers. The strikes severely injured one child but caused no apparent fatalities, he said. Strikes over the weekend sent about 2,500 people into northern Thailand’s Mae Hong Son province, according to the agency.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6390_News_0>Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha on Monday acknowledged the problems along his country's western border and said his government is preparing for a possible influx of people.\"We don't want to have mass migration into our territory, but we will consider human rights, too,\" Prayut said.Asked about people who have already fled into Thailand, Prayut said, \"We have prepared some places, but we don’t want to talk about the preparation of refugee centers at the moment. We won’t go that far.\"Video shot Sunday showed a group of villagers, including many young children, resting in a forest clearing inside Burma after fleeing their homes. They carried their possessions in bundles and baskets. In addition to those who have fled to Thailand, an estimated 10,000 people are believed to be displaced inside Burma’s northern Karen state, according to the Free Burma Rangers.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6390_News_1>The bombings may have been in retaliation for a reported attack by the Karen National Liberation Army in which they claimed to have captured a Burma government military outpost on Saturday morning. The group is fighting for greater autonomy for the Karen people.According to Thoolei News, an online site that carries official information from the Karen National Union, eight government soldiers were captured and 10 were killed. The report said one Karen guerrilla died.Before the overnight bombings, Burma military aircraft had attacked a Karen guerrilla position in Karen state’s Mutraw district on Sunday, according to humanitarian workers. Two guerrillas were killed and many more were wounded in those attacks.On Saturday night, two Burmese military planes twice bombed a village in the same district, killing at least two villagers.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6390_News_2>The government has battled the Karen fighters on and off for years — as it has with other ethnic minorities seeking more autonomy — but the airstrikes are a worrying development at a time when the junta is also violently suppressing anti-coup protests in cities across the country.The coup, which ousted the government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. As of Sunday, at least 459 people have been killed since the takeover, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The true toll is thought to be higher.On Saturday alone, at least 114 people across the country were killed by security forces, including several children — a toll that prompted a U.N. human rights expert to accuse the junta of committing \"mass murder\" and criticize the international community for not doing enough to stop it.U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters his administration is working on a response but offered no details. The United States has already levied new sanctions on the junta, as have other countries — but they have had little effect so far.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6390_News_3>\"It’s terrible. It’s absolutely outrageous. Based on the reporting I’ve gotten, an awful lot of people have been killed. Totally unnecessary,\" Biden said.The U.N. Security Council is likely to hold closed consultations on the escalating situation in Burma, diplomats said Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to release the information ahead of an official announcement. The council has condemned the violence and called for a restoration of democracy, but has not yet considered possible sanctions against the military, which would require support or an abstention by Burma’s neighbor and friend China.Despite the violence by security forces, protests have continued, and many used funerals of those killed on Saturday to show their resistance to the coup.In Yangon, the country's largest city, friends and family gathered Monday to say farewell to 49-year-old Mya Khaing, who was fatally shot on Saturday. As his coffin was moved toward the crematorium, mourners sang a defiant song from an earlier 1988 uprising against military rule.\"There is no pardon for you till the end of the world,\" the mourners sang. \"We will never forgive what you have done.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/burma-airstrikes-crisis", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6390_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In this photo released by the Free Burma Rangers, Karen villagers gather in the forests as they hide from military airstrikes in the Deh Bu Noh area of the Papun district, north Karen state, Burma, Sunday, March 28, 2021.

{"title": "Zappos founder Tony Hsieh's self-described 'right-hand person' seeking over $9M from his estate", "body": "Creditor’s claims filed in a Las Vegas court shed more light on Tony Hsieh’s self-described \"right-hand\" person’s bid for money she said the Zappos founder owed her, according to a recent report.Jennifer \"Mimi\" Pham, Hsieh’s former assistant and friend, filed the creditor’s claims on Wednesday arguing for the more than $9 million she says she is owed, local station KLAS-TV reported, citing the court documents.  In February, the Las Vegas Review-Journal was first to report Pham’s pair of lawsuits – submitted weeks apart – against the estate of Hsieh, who died in November after a fire in New London, Connecticut.In the most recent lawsuit filed last month in Nevada’s Clark County District Court, Pham argued that Hsieh had asked her to help him navigate a new venture in the documentary business through his company, Pickled Entertainment, LLC, according to the report. The pair signed a contract on Aug. 26, 2020, in which Pham, through her company, Mr. Taken, LLC, would \"provide to [Hsieh’s] Company certain management and administrative support services,\" according to court papers shared online by the Review-Journal.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News_0>But Richard and Andrew Hsieh, Tony’s relatives and administrators of his estate, allegedly suspended the business contract on Jan. 29, 2021, in a notice that \"further directed that Mr. Taken, LLC, was therefore not permitted to communicate with third parties on behalf of Pickled Entertainment, LLC or to engage with counsel or other representatives of Pickled Entertainment,\" according to the complaint.According to Pham, Hsieh had also hired her to oversee his Park City, Utah, property, dubbed \"Big Moose Yacht Club,\" for which she would manage space rentals and guests and had at one point worked with the city to secure a business license, according to the report. Much like that with Mr. Taken, the contract was cut short after Hsieh’s death.Pham’s earlier suit, which was filed on Jan. 20, alleged she had been contracted employees for Hsieh a company she co-managed, Baby Monster, LLC, and was, in turn, owed hundreds of thousands of dollars.Lawyers for Pham described her in both lawsuits as being Hsieh’s \"assistant, right hand person, and friend for the seventeen years preceding his death,\" according to the documents. A spokesperson for Hsieh’s family declined to comment when contacted by Fox News.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News_1>Wednesday’s creditor’s claim described how Pham – a \"manager and a member of Mr. Taken, LLC\" – was owed 10% of an anticipated $75 million profit, the report states.It also details how another of Pham’s companies, called Rove & Whim, LLC, was hired to work on \"personal assistance services\" and \"project related services\" for $30,000 each day, according to the report.Hsieh, 46, died on Nov. 27, 2020, nine days after a fire broke out at the New London, Connecticut, home where he and his friends, including his brother, were staying.Late last month, investigators released several hypotheses surrounding the cause of the blaze, which ignited in the home’s pool room shortly before 3:30 a.m. Hsieh was \"trapped\" in the pool room, the investigation report states, by shed doors that were \"locked with a single keypad deadbolt style lockset.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News_2><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News_3><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News_4><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News_5><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News_6>Hsieh had been staying in the shed-like room after he and the homeowner and his rumored girlfriend, Rachael Brown, had an argument at roughly 11:30 p.m. the night before. She asked him to leave the property until they departed for Maui, and Hsieh relocated to the pool room. It took six minutes from the first firetruck to arrive on scene for responders to get to Hsieh, the report notes. When firefighters found him, he was \"in a supine position on a blanket\" inside the shed.Hsieh was rushed to an area hospital, but ultimately could not be saved. His death was deemed accidental and caused by complications from smoke inhalation, officials previously said. Authorities reportedly do not believe there was criminality involved, but said the cause of the fire is so far undetermined. Investigators identified four possible hypotheses, including that the \"misuse of candles started this fire,\" careless disposal of smoking materials, or \"an intentional act by Hsieh.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/zappos-founder-tony-hsieh-assistant-estate", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6414_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "SAN FRANCISCO, CA - OCTOBER 08: Mimi Pham and Zappos.com CEO Tony Hsieh attend the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit Cockatil Party on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California.

{"title": "Mount Etna's recent eruption is a spectacular volcanic show", "body": "Mount Etna, the volcano that towers over eastern Sicily, evokes superlatives. It is Europe’s most active volcano and also the continent’s largest.And the fiery, noisy show of power it puts on for days or weeks, even years every so often, is always super spectacular. Fortunately, Etna’s latest eruption captivating the world’s attention has caused neither injuries nor evacuation.But each time it roars back into dramatic action, it wows onlookers and awes geologists who spend their careers monitoring its every quiver, rumble and belch.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6423_News_0>On Feb. 16, Etna erupted, sending up high fountains of lava, which rolled down the mountain’s eastern slope toward the uninhabited Bove Valley, which is five kilometers (three miles) wide and eight kilometers (five miles) long. The volcano has belched out ash and lava stones that showered the southern side.The activity has been continuing since, in bursts more or less intense. The flaming lava lights up the night sky in shocking hues of orange and red. There’s no telling how long this round of exciting activity will last, say volcanologists who work at the Etna Observatory run by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology.While public fascination began with the first dramatic images this month, the explosive activity began in September 2019, becoming much stronger two months ago. The current activity principally involves the south-east crater, which was created in 1971 from a series of fractures.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6423_News_1>Etna towers 3,350 meters (around 11,050 feet) above sea level and is 35 kilometers (22 miles) in diameter, although the volcanic activity has changed the mountain’s height over time.Occasionally, the airport at Catania, eastern Sicily’s largest city, has to close down for hours or days, when ash in the air makes flying in the area dangerous. Early in this recent spell of eruptive activity, the airport closed briefly.But for pilots and passengers flying to and from Catania at night when the volcano is calmer, a glimpse of fiery red in the dark sky makes for an exciting sight.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6423_News_2>With Etna’s lava flows largely contained to its uninhabited slopes, life goes in towns and villages elsewhere on the mountain. Sometimes, like in recent days, lava stones rain down on streets, bounce off cars and rattle roofs.But many residents generally find that a small inconvenience when weighted against the benefits the volcano brings. Lava flows have left fertile farmland. Apple and citrus trees flourish. Etna red and whites are some of Sicily’s most popular wines, from grapes grown on the volcanic slopes.Tourism rakes in revenues. Hikers and backpackers enjoy views of the oft-puffing mountain and the sparkling Ionian Sea below. For skiers who want uncrowded slopes, Etna’s a favorite.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6423_News_3>Inspiring ancient Greek legends, Etna has had scores of known eruptions in its history. An eruption in 396 B.C. has been credited with keeping the army of Carthage at bay.In 1669, in what has been considered the volcano’s worst known eruption, lava buried a swath of Catania, about 23 kilometers (15 miles) away and devastated dozens of villages. An eruption in 1928 cut off a rail route circling the mountain’s base.More recently, in 1983, dynamite was used to divert lava threatening inhabited areas. In 1992, the army built an earthen wall to contain the lava, flowing from Etna for months, from hitting Zafferana Etnea, a village of a few thousand people. At one point, the smoking lava stopped two kilometers (just over a mile) from the edge of town.Over the last century, a hiccup in geological time, low-energy explosive eruptions and lava flows, both fed from the summit and side vents, have characterized Etna.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/mount-etna-puts-on-its-latest-spectacular-show", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6423_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A fiery river of glowing lava flows on the north-east side of the Mt Etna volcano engulfed with ashes and smoke near Milo, Sicily, Wednesday night, Feb. 24, 2021.

{"title": "Powerful Japan earthquake sets off landslide, minor injuries", "body": "TOKYO — Residents in northeastern Japan on Sunday cleaned up clutter and debris in stores and homes after a strong earthquake set off a landslide on a highway, damaged buildings and parts of bullet train lines and caused power blackouts for thousands of people.The 7.3 magnitude temblor late Saturday shook the quake-prone areas of Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures that 10 years ago had been hit by a powerful earthquake that triggered a tsunami and a meltdown at a nuclear power plant.More than 140 people suffered mostly minor injures, many of them by falling objects and cuts while stepping on broken glass. Three people were confirmed with serious injures but there were no reports of deaths, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6446_News_0>Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant that was hit by the March 2011 disaster, said the water used to cool spent fuel rods near the reactors had spilled because of the shaking. But there were no radiation leaks or other irregularities, TEPCO said.The quake did not cause a tsunami because the epicenter was deep at 55 kilometers (34 miles) beneath the ocean.Noriko Kamaya, a Japan Meteorological Agency spokesperson, said in a news conference that the quake is considered to be an aftershock of the 9.1 magnitude quake in 2011.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6446_News_1>Power had been restored by early Sunday, although some bullet train services were still halted. East Japan Railway Co. said the bullet train on the northern coast will be suspended through Monday due to damage to its facility.TV footage and video shared on social media showed boxes, books and other items scattered on floors. In the northern Fukushima city of Soma, a roof at a Buddhist temple collapsed.Workers were clearing up a major coastal highway connecting Tokyo and northern cities where a major landslide occurred. Several other roads were also blocked by rocks.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6446_News_2>Saturday's powerful rattling less than a month before the 10th anniversary of the 2011 triple disaster was a frightening reminder of the earlier tragedy for the residents in the region.\"It started with minor shaking, then suddenly became violent,\" said Yuki Watanabe, a convenience store employee in the Fukushima town of Minamisoma, told the Asahi newspaper. \"I was so frightened,\" she said, adding it reminder her of the 2011 quake.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6446_News_3>As she ran outside, she heard banging noise coming from behind the store as glass bottles from the shelves smashed against the floor.Experts warned of more aftershocks. Many residents spent the night at evacuation centers, where tents were set up as part of coronavirus protection measures.Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy, expressed sympathy for those who had suffered damage and injuries.\"The government will continue to do our utmost to respond,\" he said.Defense troops also were mobilized to provide water in some areas.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/powerful-japan-earthquake-sets-off-landslide-minor-injuries", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6446_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Evacuees shelter at a gym as an earthquake hit the area, in Soma, Fukushima prefecture, northeastern Japan, Sunday, Feb. 14, 2021.

{"title": "Rescuers in India digging for 37 trapped in glacier flood", "body": "Rescuers in northern India were working Monday to rescue more than three dozen power plant workers trapped in a tunnel after part of a Himalayan glacier broke off and sent a wall of water and debris rushing down the mountain in a disaster that has left 18 people dead and 165 missing.More than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police have been taking part in search-and-rescue operations in the northern state of Uttarakhand after Sunday's flood, which destroyed one dam, damaged another and washed away homes downstream.Officials said the focus was on saving 37 workers who are stuck inside a tunnel at one of the affected hydropower plants. Excavators had been brought in the help with the efforts to reach the workers, who have been out of contact since the flood.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_0>\"The tunnel is filled with debris, which has come from the river. We are using machines to clear the way,\" said H. Gurung, a senior official of the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police.Authorities fear many more are dead and were searching for bodies downstream using boats. They also walked along river banks and used binoculars to scan for bodies that might have been washed downstream.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_1>The flood was caused when a portion of Nanda Devi glacier snapped off Sunday morning, releasing water trapped behind it. Experts said the disaster could be linked to global warming and a team of scientists was flown to the site Monday to investigate what exactly happened.The floodwater rushed down the mountain and into other bodies of water, forcing the evacuation of many villages along the banks of the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers. Video showed the muddy, concrete-gray floodwaters tumbling through a valley and surging into a dam, breaking it into pieces with little resistance before roaring on downstream. It turned the countryside into what looked like an ash-colored moonscape.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_2>A hydroelectric plant on the Alaknanda was destroyed, and a plant under construction on the Dhauliganga was damaged, said Vivek Pandey, an Indo Tibetan Border Police spokesman. Flowing out of the Himalayan mountains, the two rivers meet before merging with the Ganges River.The trapped workers were at the Dhauliganga plant, where on Sunday 12 workers were rescued from a separate tunnel.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_3>A senior government official told The Associated Press that they don't know the total number of people who were working in the Dhauliganga project. \"The number of missing people can go up or come down,\" S A Murugesan said.Pandey said Monday that 165 workers at the two plants, not including those trapped in the tunnel, were missing and at least 18 bodies were recovered.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_4>Those rescued Sunday were taken to a hospital, where they were recovering.One of the rescued workers, Rakesh Bhatt, told The Associated Press said they were working in the tunnel when water rushed in.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_5>\"We thought it might be rain and that the water will recede. But when we saw mud and debris enter with great speed, we realized something big had happened,\" he said.Bhatt said one of the workers was able to contact officials via his mobile phone.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_6>\"We waited for almost six hours — praying to God and joking with each other to keep our spirits high. I was the first to be rescued and it was a great relief,\" he said.The Himalayan area where Sunday's flood struck has a chain of hydropower projects on several rivers and their tributaries. Authorities said they were able to save other power units downstream because of timely action taken to release water by opening gates.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News_7>The floodwaters also damaged homes, but details on the number and whether any residents were injured, missing or dead remained unclear. Officials said they were trying to track whether anyone was missing from villages along the two rivers.Government officials airdropped food packets and medicine to at least two flood-hit villages.Many people in nearby villages work at the Dhauliganga plant, Murugesan said, but as it was a Sunday fewer people were at work than on a weekday,\"The only solace for us is that the casualty from the nearby villages is much less,\" he said.Some have already started pointing at climate change as a contributing factor given the known melting and breakup of the world’s glaciers, though other factors such as erosion, earthquakes, a buildup of water pressure and volcanic eruptions have also been known to cause glaciers to collapse.Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct professor at the Indian School of Business who has contributed to U.N.-sponsored research on global warming, said that while data on the cause of the disaster was not yet available, \"this looks very much like a climate change event as the glaciers are melting due to global warming.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/rescuers-in-india-digging-for-37-trapped-in-glacier-flood", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6452_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Rescuers prepare to search for bodies in the downstream of Alaknanda River in Rudraprayag, northern state of Uttarakhand, India, Monday, Feb.8, 2021.

There was no sign of survivors.\"I represent the government and all Indonesians in expressing my deep condolences for this tragedy,\" President Joko Widodo said.\"We are doing our best to save the victims. We pray together so that the victims can be found,\" he said, adding that he had asked the National Transport Safety Committee to conduct an investigation.Fishermen in the area between Lancang and Laki islands, part of an archipelago around Thousand Islands north of Jakarta’s coast, reported hearing an explosion around 2:30 p.m. Saturday.\"We heard something explode, we thought it was a bomb or a tsunami since after that we saw the big splash from the water,\" Solihin, who goes by one name, told The Associated Press by phone.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6468_News_1>\"It was raining heavily and the weather was so bad. So it is difficult to see around clearly. But we can see the splash and a big wave after the sounds. We were very shocked and directly saw the plane debris and the fuel around our boat.\"Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said Flight SJ182 was delayed for an hour before it took off at 2:36 p.m. It disappeared from radar four minutes later, after the pilot contacted air traffic control to ascend to an altitude of 29,000 feet (8,839 meters), he said.There were 62 people on board, including seven children and three babies.\"We are aware of media reports from Jakarta regarding Sriwijaya Air flight SJ-182,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families.

One video shows a woman with her children waving goodbye while walking through the airport.Sriwijaya Air President Director Jefferson Irwin Jauwena said the plane, which is 26 years old and previously used by airlines in the United States, was airworthy. He told reporters Saturday that the plane had previously flown to Pontianak and Pangkal Pinang city on the same day.\"Maintenance report said everything went well and airworthy,\" Jauwena told a news conference. He said the plane was delayed due to bad weather, not because of any damage.Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation, with more than 260 million people, has been plagued by transportation accidents on land, sea and air because of overcrowding on ferries, aging infrastructure and poorly enforced safety standards.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6468_News_3>In October 2018, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet operated by Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. The plane involved in Saturday’s incident did not have the automated flight-control system that played a role in the Lion Air crash and another crash of a 737 MAX 8 jet in Ethiopia five months later, leading to the grounding of the MAX 8 for 20 months.The Lion Air crash was Indonesia’s worst airline disaster since 1997, when 234 people were killed on a Garuda airlines flight near Medan on Sumatra island.

{"title": "Historic Louisiana hurricane season leaves people homeless for the holidays", "body": "Heading into the Christmas holiday, people in Lake Charles are still recovering from not one, but two major storms: Hurricane Laura devastated the area in August and just six weeks later Hurricane Delta followed suit.  According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), more than 1,000 people are in hotel rooms because of Hurricane Laura. FEMA estimates it will be \"early summer 2021\" before everyone in need gets direct housing.  As of Dec. 15, 853 temporary housing structures have been sent for residents. The deadline for housing referrals is Dec. 31. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6482_News_0>As for those still awaiting housing from FEMA or other sources, some are now living in tents; that list includes Katelyn Smith and her family. The family of nine rode out the Category 4 storm in a home next to their trailer.  \"I was crying from all the loud banging happening outside,\" Smith said. \"I told my dad ‘I am scared, and he said 'you and the boy go in the bathroom with your brother' and about 10 minutes later, the add-on to the house flew away.\"When it was finally safe to go outside, the family had nothing to go home to. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6482_News_1>\"We think our trailer flipped like three times because we had a tree that was in front of it and it ended up going through that and onto the roof,\" Smith said.The mobile home is now a pile of debris on the side of the road, forcing the family into tents.  \"We don’t really have a lot of family and we don’t really know anybody, so our only option really was tents,\" Smith said.  Smith stayed in a tent for about two months before moving into a donated trailer, the rest of her family is still in tents where their mobile home used to be.  \"It sucks, it doesn’t feel good at all,\" Smith said. \"It will probably be like this until FEMA can help out.\"  She feels like, \"Lake Charles has been forgotten.\" \"People like us are still out here going through this situation. I think Lake Charles has been forgotten,\" Smith said. \"It has only been a little while and it’s going to be a long time before we are back.\"  Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said with debris cleanup halfway done, housing is a No. 1 priority. \"We believe, if you want to look at it as a percentage, about 5% of our housing stock was brought offline and is still offline,\" Hunter said. \"That is about 1,000 structures, some of which were multi-family homes.\"  Hunter said anyone living in tents can reach out to his office for help.  \"We have come across local people and the vast majority of the time, if they contact our office, we will get them help,\" Hunter said. \"If there is a citizen in this city who feels like their only option is to live in a tent, they need to reach out to the mayor’s office.\" <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6482_News_2>Meanwhile, the city also is working to finish cleaning up debris left behind by the storms. As of now, an estimated 3.4 million cubic yards of debris has been picked up. That is enough to cover 531 football fields.  \"Our debris contractors who are some of the biggest in the country have told us they have not seen this amount of debris since Hurricane Katrina,\" Hunter said. Hunter said the latest estimate shows more than 5 million cubic yards of debris will be picked up once the cleanup efforts are done.  As of now, infrastructure -- like water and electricity -- is back online for the city. Hunter is calling on FEMA for help getting citizens into homes, and in the meantime, he is asking \"Americans to help Americans.\" \"We have had angels, literal angels come in to help us, but we still need a federal response,\" Hunter said. \"Americans shoe up to help Americans and I am asking Americans not to forget about Lake Charles.\" And the devastation is leaving little room for hope over the holidays.  \"We are not having a Christmas this year, because you can’t have a Christmas without a home,\" Smith said. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6482_News_3>But, with spirits down, the Cajun Navy is working to spread some holiday cheer. The group of volunteers started a Cajun Tree, which is an Angel Tree with a Louisiana flair.  \"We just wanted to make sure that no kid went without a toy, that every kid got something,\" Sandra Polanco, the Cajun Navy’s director of operations, said. \"People uploaded the names of children and people were able to go on the app to adopt a child.\"  More than 400 children were added to the list of those needing gifts this holiday season. Over half of the kids were claimed and people are now sending wrapped gifts from across the country. As hundreds of requests poured in, one specifically shined a light on the true need of Lake Charles this holiday season.  \"One girl, where it said ‘what toy do you want,’ put a home,\" Polanco said. \"It is sad because you know that means they are in a shelter or may not have somewhere to sleep.\"  The children that weren’t claimed will still get a gift from the Cajun Navy on Dec. 18 during a drive-thru event.  The Cajun Navy has set up a headquarters in Lake Charles since Hurricane Laura made landfall, and is echoing calls for help for the residents of Lake Charles. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6482_News_4>\"There are still people we are finding in tents, under a bridge or in their truck,\" Polanco said. \"People here are still hurting and there are people that just don’t know if they will have food tomorrow.\"  Hunter did not have an estimate for when the city will be completely recovered from the historic hurricane season, but said it is well ahead of schedule.  \"The earliest estimates for what we had experienced with the loss of infrastructure was pretty grim,\" Hunter said. \"But I think we can acknowledge that while we have a long road ahead of us and we are still in the thick of this fight, we have come a long way and we have a lot of victories.\"  Hurricane Laura left more than 30 people dead, half of which were due to carbon monoxide poisoning from the unsafe operation of generators following the Category 4 storm. Meanwhile, four people died in Hurricane Delta, a Category 2 storm.

{"title": "Hurricanes stay stronger longer after landfall than in past, study says", "body": "Hurricanes are keeping their staying power longer once they make landfall, spreading more inland destruction, according to a new study.Warmer ocean waters from climate change are likely making hurricanes lose power more slowly after landfall, because they act as a reserve fuel tank for moisture, the study found.With Hurricane Eta threatening Florida and the Gulf Coast in a few days, the study’s lead author warned of more damage away from the coast than in the past.The new study looked at 71 Atlantic hurricanes with landfalls since 1967. It found that in the 1960s, hurricanes declined two-thirds in wind strength within 17 hours of landfall. But now it generally takes 33 hours for storms to weaken that same degree, according to a study in Wednesday’s journal Nature.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6509_News_0>\"This is a huge increase,\" study author Pinaki Chakraborty, a professor of fluid dynamics at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. \"There’s been a huge slowdown in the decay of hurricanes.\"Hurricane Florence, which in 2018 caused $24 billion in damage, took nearly 50 hours to decay by nearly two-thirds after making landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, Chakraborty said. Hurricane Hermine in 2016 took more than three days to lose that much power after hitting Florida’s Apalachee Bay.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6509_News_1>As the world warms from human-caused climate change, inland cities like Atlanta should see more damage from future storms that just won't quit, Chakraborty said.\"If their conclusions are sound, which they seem to be, then at least in the Atlantic, one could argue that insurance rates need to start going up and building codes need to be improved ... to compensate for this additional wind and water destructive power reaching farther inland,\" said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy, who wasn’t part of the study.There’s less study of what hurricanes do once they make landfall than out at sea, so Chakraborty said he was surprised when he saw a noticeable trend in decay taking longer. Before he started the study, Chakraborty said he figured the decline in power shouldn’t change over the years even with man-made climate change, because storms tend to lose strength when cut off from warm water that fuels them.It stops going, like a car that runs out of gas, he said.But hurricanes aren’t running out of gas as much, especially in the last 25 years when the trend accelerated, Chakraborty said. To find out why, he charted the ocean temperature near where the hurricane had traveled and found it mirrored the decay trend on land.Researchers then simulated hurricanes that were identical except for water temperature. Seeing the warmer water storms decayed slower, they reached their conclusion: The trend showing a slowdown of hurricane decay resulted from warmer ocean water temperatures, caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6509_News_2>\"That’s an amazing signal that they found,\" said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and hurricane scientist Jim Kossin, who wasn’t part of the study but did review it for the journal Nature.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6509_News_3>This study joins previous studies, many by Kossin, that show tropical systems are slowing down more, wetter, moving more toward the poles — and that the strongest hurricanes are getting stronger.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//science/hurricanes-stay-stronger-longer-after-landfall-than-in-past", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6509_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "This enhanced satellite image made available by NOAA shows Tropical Storm Florence, upper left, in the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2018 at 3:30 p.m. EDT.

{"title": "Tropical Storm Eta lashes Nicaragua with rains, deadly mudslides", "body": "Tropical Storm Eta spun through northern Nicaragua Wednesday after lashing the country’s Caribbean coast for much of the past day, its floodwaters isolating already remote communities and setting off deadly landslides that killed at least three people.The storm had weakened from the Category 4 hurricane that battered the coast, but it was moving so slowly and dumping so much rain that much of Central America was on high alert. Eta had sustained winds of 45 mph and was moving westward at 7 mph.The long-term forecast shows Eta taking a turn over Central America and then reforming in the Caribbean — possibly reaching Cuba on Sunday and the Florida Keys on Monday.Eta was located Wednesday morning 125 miles north-northeast of Managua, Nicaragua's capital.Eta came ashore Tuesday afternoon south of Bilwi after stalling just off the coast for hours. The city of about 60,000 had been without power since Monday evening. Corrugated metal roofing and uprooted trees were scattered through its streets. Some 20,000 of the area's residents were in shelters.Inland, about 100 miles west of where Eta made landfall, two gold miners were killed when a mountainside unleashed tons of mud Tuesday morning. A third miner escaped the slide and sought help.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6522_News_0>One body was recovered before rescuers had to suspend recovery efforts due to nightfall and there were fears that more slides could occur as the rain continued, said Lt. Cesar Malespin of the Bonanza Fire Department. Bonanza was getting lashed by strong winds and torrential rain, he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6522_News_1>The storm also has been drenching neighboring Honduras with rain since at least Sunday, and the country reported its first storm-related death on Tuesday. A 12-year-old girl died in a mudslide in San Pedro Sula, the main population center in northern Honduras, said Marvin Aparicio of Honduras’ emergency management agency.In Honduras, at least 559 people had to move to shelters or go to relatives’ homes to escape flooding, he said. At least 25 people had been rescued. His agency reported at least six rivers causing significant flooding.Forecasters said central and northern Nicaragua and much of Honduras could get 15 to 25 inches of rain, with 35 inches in isolated areas. Heavy rains also were likely in eastern Guatemala, southern Belize and Jamaica.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6522_News_2>The quantities of rain expected drew comparisons to 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the most deadly Atlantic hurricanes in history. The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Mitch led to the deaths of more than 9,000 people.Nicaragua’s remote northeast where Eta made landfall was already isolated before the storm. Crossing the wide Wawa river to reach Bilwi, the main city in the region, requires riding a ferry, which had suspended operations as the storm approached, making driving to the impact zone impossible.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6522_News_3>Cairo Jarquin, emergency response project manager in Nicaragua for Catholic Relief Services, said the immediate concern in northeastern Nicaragua after the storm’s passage would be getting water and food to those remote communities.The majority of the region’s inhabitants are Miskito, who live through subsistence farming or fishing, Jarquin said. Most of their homes are simple wooden structures concentrated in riverside communities that likely suffered heavy damage. They depend on hand-dug wells for drinking water, which he feared would be contaminated by floodwaters.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6522_News_4>As the storm continued west toward Nicaragua’s mountains and the border with Honduras concerns grew that it could have devastating impact on the country’s coffee crop — a key export — just as the harvest was set to begin.Eta already led Honduras to cancel a long weekend that had been scheduled to begin Wednesday. The extra-long weekend was supposed to spur tourism and help the economy strangled by the coronavirus pandemic.

Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6527_News_0>\"The child was found 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,\" Albay Gov.

One person was killed in Catanduanes province.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6527_News_2>Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon’s landfall, people could face \"catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.\"Residents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 16 feet and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6527_News_3>One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013.Manila’s main airport was ordered shut down for 24 hours from Sunday to Monday, and airlines canceled dozens of international and domestic flights. Commuter train services were also suspended and a no-sail policy restriction was imposed by the coast guard due to initial fear over the typhoon’s threatening power.

Two teenagers were killed Friday on Samos and at least 19 others were injured.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6526_News_0>There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while Istanbul's Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said it measured 6.6.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6526_News_1>Ahmet Citim, 70, was pulled out of the rubble in the middle of the night and was hospitalized. Koca tweeted that Citim said: “I never lost hope.” The minister visited the survivor and said he was doing well.The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens.Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Turkey’s disaster agency said nearly 900 people were injured in Turkey alone.Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished.“It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6526_News_2>Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit.

{"title": "Zeta blasts Gulf Coast, leaving at least 3 dead and millions without power across South", "body": "Zeta is roaring across the Southeast on Thursday, threatening to bring more damage from its powerful winds as the scope of the destruction spawned by the storm is being revealed along the Gulf Coast.The storm made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane in southeastern Louisiana, packing winds of 110 mph before quickly roaring through the metro New Orleans area. Zeta has since weakened to a tropical storm, but it's still blasting the region with 60 mph winds. \"A tropical storm that made landfall yesterday across Louisiana, fifth named storm to make landfall across that state, as almost a Category 3 storm,\" Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"We certainly saw those wind gusts over parts of Louisiana. Very strong winds over Mississippi and even New Orleans.\"The storm has been blamed for at least three deaths so far. In Louisiana, a 55-year-old man died after a coroner said he was electrocuted by a downed power line in New Orleans.

Signs outside bars and restaurants swayed back and forth in the wind and palm trees along Canal Street whipped furiously as the storm passed.New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell implored residents to stay home and let city officials assess the damage.“Although we have made it through, we have been damaged, we have been hit,” she said.Many residents were surprised at the mess in New Orleans, as the city was littered with toppled trees and fences.“I don’t remember the last time we had a storm of this magnitude in October,” Stephanie Becnel told the Associated Press.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6532_News_4>“We just cleaned up our yard and decorated for Halloween, so now we have to do it all over again,” Becnel said. “But I think that’s mainly what it’s going to be is just cleaning up debris, tree limbs, trash.”Videos from across the region show the storm's wicked winds ripping roofs off homes and tossing debris across roadways.Zeta's storm surge also caused a boat to be pushed onto a flooded Louisiana State Highway 1.As much as 5 feet of Gulf water surrounded a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, and deputies in Harrison County, Mississippi, received multiple calls from people who had remained in mobile homes that were threatened by winds.As the storm headed inland, Zeta's wicked winds lead to a semi-truck being overturned on Interstate 10 in Mississippi.The storm has swept inland with its whipping winds causing major damage in the Atlanta area.

{"title": "Super typhoon batters Philippines, 1 million in shelters", "body": "MANILA, Philippines — A super typhoon slammed into the eastern Philippines with ferocious winds early Sunday, knocking down power in several towns and prompting the evacuation of about a million people in its likely path, including in the capital where the main airport was shut down.Typhoon Goni hit the island province of Catanduanes at dawn with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph) — equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. It was blowing west toward densely populated regions, including Manila, and rain-soaked provinces still recovering from a typhoon that hit a week ago and left at least 22 dead.There were initial reports of deaths, including a man who was reportedly pinned by a fallen tree in Albay province, but authorities said they were still verifying the details.About two hours after it blew ashore, the typhoon battered Albay with a slightly weaker sustained winds but more powerful gusts of 310 kph (193 mph), forecasters said.Diane Joco scrambled with her husband, parents, siblings and cousin out of their flimsy houses on stilts on the shores of Calauag town in Quezon province when the wind began to batter their wooden homes. Goni was forecast to hit parts of Quezon Sunday afternoon.Like many villagers, Joco and relatives decided not to evacuate and stayed in a neighbor’s sturdier house close to the coast to watch over their home.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6529_News_0>“We should be nearby to be able to repair any damage to our house quickly, otherwise it will fall apart and be blown away. We have no other house,” Joco told The Associated Press by phone. She suddenly yelled as she spoke, saying a part of the tin roof of her neighbor’s house was nearly ripped off by a frightening gust.Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told a televised meeting of top disaster-response officials that at least two people died in his province while mudflows from Mayon volcano endangered some villagers. Other officials, however, said they were still checking those reports.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6529_News_1>Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, said the typhoon’s destructive force can cause major damage. “There are so many people who are really in vulnerable areas,” he said.The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within the next 12 hours, people will experience “catastrophic violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall associated with the region of the eyewall and inner rain bands.\"Residents have been warned of likely landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6529_News_2>One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni has evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.Jalad said nearly a million people have been preemptively moved into emergency shelters. He warned of storm surges that could inundate coastal villages, including in Manila Bay.Forecasters said the typhoon’s eye may pass about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of metropolitan Manila, the sprawling capital of more than 13 million people, around nightfall on Sunday.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6529_News_3>Manila’s main airport was ordered shut down for 24 hours from Sunday to Monday and airlines canceled dozens of international and domestic flights. The military and national police, along with the coast guard, have been put on full alert.Hundreds of COVID-19 patients were moved to hospitals and hotels from tent quarantine centers, Jalad said. The war-like typhoon preparations will further strain government resources, which have been drained by months of coronavirus outbreaks. The Philippines has the second-largest number of confirmed infections in Southeast Asia.The Philippines is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year.

{"title": "Hurricane Zeta 'strengthening,' expected landfall in Louisiana as Category 2 storm", "body": "A reenergized Hurricane Zeta is taking aim at the U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday and is expected to become even stronger before it makes landfall in Louisiana.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Zeta is packing maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and is located about 155 miles south-southwest of New Orleans, moving north-northeast at 20 mph. The latest advisory from the NHC notes that an Air Force \"Hurricane Hunter\" aircraft finds that Zeta is growing stronger hours before landfall.\"Zeta is getting stronger and we are anticipating a Category 2, a strong Category 2 moving into eastern Louisiana and western Mississippi later on this afternoon,\" Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"National Hurricane Center has found winds much stronger than originally anticipated.\"The system is now expected to make landfall as a strong Category 2 storm south of New Orleans, which will bring life-threatening storm surge, flooding rainfall, damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes.

The storm's landfall in Louisiana would be the fifth so far this busy 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. The state has been hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes this year: Laura, blamed for at least 27 Louisiana deaths after it struck in August, and Delta, which exacerbated Laura’s damage in the same area just weeks later.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6538_News_6>Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards asked President Trump for a disaster declaration ahead of the storm. He and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey both declared emergencies, as did Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich in Biloxi, Mississippi. Trump declared an emergency for Louisiana Tuesday evening.“There’s no doubt that we’ve seen a lot this year, with COVID and so many threats from so many storms,” Gilich said in a news release, “but this storm shows that we haven’t seen it all yet.\"New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell also issued an emergency declaration ahead of the storm, with a voluntary evacuation order for areas outside of the levee protection system in Orleans Parish.The storm approached as New Orleans officials announced that a turbine that generates power to the city's aging drainage pump system broke down Sunday, with no quick repair in sight. There was enough power to keep the pumps operating if needed but it left authorities with little excess power to tap should a breakdown of other turbines occur, officials said at a news conference.\"This is a stronger storm,\" Dean said Wednesday morning. \"New Orleans, you need to be solidifying your preparations and knowing what you're going to do.\"A mandatory evacuation order was issued for Grand Isle, where a new levee has quickly been built after damage from earlier storms this season. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6538_News_7>“Zeta is coming in fast,\" Mayor David Camardelle told FOX8. \"It’s the seventh cone and it’s right on top of us.\"Yet another approaching storm added more stress to evacuees from previous hurricanes to strike the state.The state is sheltering about 3,600 evacuees from Laura and Delta, most in New Orleans area hotels.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6538_News_8>“I’m physically and mentally tired,” Yolanda Lockett of Lake Charles told the Associated Press from a New Orleans hotel.Residents in New Orleans said Tuesday they were feeling the storm fatigue but not letting their guard down.“I’m always worried about the storm.

{"title": "Georgia train derailment sparks fire after Delta unleashes flash flooding, tornadoes across South", "body": "Heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Delta triggered flash flooding and violent weather across the Southeast on Sunday — even washing out tracks, which led to a train derailment in Georgia. The National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Atlanta said the storm system dropped 2 to 3 inches of rain across Atlanta's metropolitan area, with some locally higher isolated amounts. Those heavy rains led to a train derailment in Lilburn early Sunday, located northeast of Atlanta.The Gwinnett County Fire and Emergency Services said in a news release that a CSX train with about 170 cars, including three locomotives, ran off the track around 1:45 a.m. Sunday.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6564_News_0>Officials said a total of 38 cars derailed, which sparked a small fire. The fire involved “hazardous materials,” spokesperson Justin Wilson said. The agency shared photos on social media of smoky air over buildings in the city northeast of downtown Atlanta.Officials went door to door evacuating homes for starting at 2 a.m. as the pinkish-orange plume of smoke rose into the air.“We were just in panic mode and wasn’t sure what was going on,” resident Jaquelyn Bustamante told FOX5.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6564_News_1>Evacuation orders were eventually lifted around 6 a.m., but crews were still continuing “atmospheric monitoring” in the area.The derailment appears to have been caused by a washed-out track from intense rain and flash flood conditions in the area, CSX said in a statement.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6564_News_2>The railroad told FOX5 that of the 37 cars that derailed, at least two cars carried ethanol which leaked from the accident.  Two employees involved in the derailment were able to get to safety and were being evaluated for possible injuries, according to local rescue officials. No injuries were immediately reported.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6564_News_3>State and federal water management personnel told FOX5 they plan on conducting tests to make sure none of the chemicals got into a nearby creek or the runoff.Additional flooding along the same creek led to additional rescues in Gwinnett County. Firefighters in Gwinnett County shared a video of first responders rescuing a pair from inside a car in the middle of the flood along Hillcrest Road.

{"title": "Hurricane Delta's death toll at 4 as Louisiana officials stress generator safety after deadly fire", "body": "Tens of thousands of people remain without power in Louisiana after Hurricane Delta delivered another blow to the region, spurring officials to once again warn about generator safety after a deadly fire.The Louisiana Department of Health said there have been two deaths tied to Delta in the state, including an 86-year-old man in St. Martin Parish who died after refueling a hot generator located in a shed, which then caught fire.“This is an incredibly unfortunate loss of life,” Louisiana State Fire Marshal Chief H. “Butch” Browning said in a statement. “We want all Louisianans to not only take the generator safety tips we’ve been sharing very seriously, but also remember simple fire safety tips that we promote often, especially ‘get out, stay out.’”According to the state fire marshal's office, the incident happened around 10:45 p.m. on Saturday in St. Martinville.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6561_News_0>The 86-year-old went into a large, metal maintenance shed where a generator had been operating for several hours to refuel it. Shortly after refueling, officials said a fire was noticed in the shed. Investigators believe the man went into the shed to extinguish the fire but never reemerged. Browning told KATC-TV that people using generators should wait 15 minutes for it to cool down before refueling it to prevent any sort of explosion or fire. \"Because you can spill vapors, you can have vapors in that building, that will ignite a fire,\" he said Monday. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6561_News_1>State officials are once again stressing generator safety, after nine deaths in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura were linked to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator. Four of those deaths happened in one home in Lake Charles.Health officials advise that generators should never be used indoors, including in a garage, carport, basement, crawl space, or other enclosed or partially enclosed area, even those with ventilation.\"Opening windows or doors or using fans will not prevent the build-up of carbon monoxide,\" the Louisiana Department of Health states. \"If you start to feel sick, dizzy, or weak while using a generator, get to fresh air immediately.\"But on Monday, state fire marshal once again shared a photo of a generator that was sticking out of a garage in Lake Charles.\"We may seem like a broken record at this point, but we’re learning every day that our generator safety messages need to continue to be spread far and wide,\" the office posted on Facebook. Teams in the neighborhood then placed warning signs in the area about generator dangers.The second death in the state was a 70-year-old woman in Iberia Parish, who died in a fire that was likely caused by a natural gas leak following damage from Hurricane Delta.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6561_News_2>Friends identified her as Judy Neal, who was an animal rescuer. An undetermined number of her pets also died in the blaze.\"She was a warrior for these animals,\" Christie Russell told The Acadiana Advocate. \"She was a selfless person who lived for this.

In addition to the two deaths in Louisiana, two men drowned in the northern Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Delta churned up the surf, causing strong rip currents. The National Weather Service (NWS) said a 49-year-old man got caught in a rip current and drowned east of Pensacola Beach, Fla., on Friday, while a 19-year-old man drowned in a rip current in Destin on Saturday.The NWS said Monday that a total of 14 tornadoes have been confirmed so far from the storm's remnants.The storm also caused flash flooding that led to a train derailment in Georgia.The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it is still installing tarps on homes damaged by Hurricane Laura, and will check on and replace if needed those already installed and then hit by Delta in Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Vernon parishes. “ALL eligible homeowners within the six affected parishes are eligible to sign-up for a FREE temporary roof ... through Oct. 24,” a news release said.President Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that the federal government is \"there to help.\"\"We love the people of Lake Charles, Louisiana,\" the president said. \"You’ve been hit hard , and often, but your Federal Government is there to help.

{"title": "Hurricane Delta delivers Louisiana another blow as residents say they're 'numb' after latest storm", "body": "Six weeks after Hurricane Laura blasted throughout southwest Louisiana, residents are spending the weekend cleaning up new damage after Hurricane Delta roared into the storm-battered region.The storm made landfall Friday night near the coastal town of Creole as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph, just 13 miles east of where Laura barreled inland in late August as a Category 4 storm. At a news conference on Saturday, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the storm dumped more than 15 inches of rain on Lake Charles over two days and more than 10 inches in Baton Rouge, with flooding being the biggest impact from this latest storm.Delta also had a \"much larger\" wind field than Laura, which knocked out power to more than 600,000 customers, roughly 25% of all power customers in the entire state, according to Edwards.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_0>The governor said a peak of 638,000 customers without power was reported, which has since dropped to around 358,000 as of Sunday morning, according to power-outage tracking website poweroutage.us.\"So restoration appears to be happening more rapidly than was the case after Laura, and that’s because the damage to the infrastructure is not as significant. But that’s still an awful lot of power outages,” the governor said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_1>No deaths had been reported by Saturday evening, but Laura was a reminder that a hurricane’s wake can be treacherous. Seven of the 32 deaths attributed to Laura came the day that hurricane struck. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_2>Many others were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, and 10,000 utility workers were dispatched Saturday to get power restored to thousands of customers.Delta roared over the Lake Charles region after landfall, where Laura had damaged nearly every home and business in late August. Many of the structures had blue tarps to conceal roof damage.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_3>Earnestine and Milton Wesley told the Associated Press they decided to ride out the storm in their damaged home but found themselves spending Friday night holding onto their tarp tight as water poured in. “We fought all night long trying to keep things intact,” Milton said Saturday. “And with God’s help, we made it.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_4>Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said Saturday he estimated that hundreds of damaged homes across the city took on water from Delta's heavy rains.“Add Laura and Delta together and it’s just absolutely unprecedented and catastrophic,” Hunter said. “We are very concerned that with everything going in the country right now that this incident may not be on the radar nationally like it should be.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_5>Piles of unsecured debris from Laura were also tossed around in the storm's gusty winds and pushed away in floodwaters.Some people who had already done drywall repair or replacement after Laura are finding themselves having to start over again after their work got drenched by Delta's heavy rains.Lake Charles resident Katie Prejean McGrady had only just returned last week to her home with her family, which had lost part of their roof, fence, and swing set in Laura. Her family then had to evacuate when Delta took aim at the region.“I’m taxed out. And I think that’s most people in town,” she told the AP. “There’s a mental exhaustion that sets in and then there’s a fear of ‘Does anybody outside this region care?’”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_6>In the town of Jennings, residents said they had just finished cleaning downed tree limbs and power lines from Laura. Now Delta left behind another path of damage.“We’re numb, we’re really numb,” Ralph LeBlanc told The New Orleans Advocate. “This town was all cleaned up, we just got it cleaned up last week. Of course, we’re without electricity, but we’re just about used to that.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_7>Edwards said Delta disrupted state efforts to set up temporary housing in southwest Louisiana to bring back Laura evacuees scattered across hotels. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6570_News_8>More than 9,400 people were being sheltered by the state Saturday, but only 935 were Delta evacuees, Edwards said. The others were still displaced by Laura.The remnants of Delta are now pushing across the Southeast, bringing heavy rains across the region.

Some were grateful that the damage was not as bad as it could have been.A 70-year-old woman in Iberia Parish died in a fire likely caused by a natural gas leak following damage from Hurricane Delta, the Louisiana Department of Health said Sunday.Louisiana officials also blamed the death of an 86-year-old man on the hurricane.

Water poured in, flooding their den.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_4>“We fought all night long trying to keep things intact,” Milton said. “And with God’s help we made it.”After blowing ashore, Delta moved over Lake Charles, a city where Laura damaged nearly every home and building. More than 8,000 Louisiana residents who evacuated because of Laura were still in shelters as of Sunday, Edwards said. Roughly 850 people were in shelters because of Delta.Before Friday’s storm, the streets of Lake Charles were already lined with mountains of debris from the previous hurricane — soggy insulation, moldy mattresses, tree limbs, twisted metal siding, ruined family treasures. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter estimated hundreds of already damaged homes took on water from Delta, which dumped more than 15 inches of rain on the city over two days.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_5>Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, was the 10th to hit the U.S. mainland this year, breaking a record set in 1916, Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach said.The floodwaters surged up the Wesley family’s front yard, and they were terrified it would pour inside, but it stopped short of the door. It carried with it bags of trash and muck, swept up from their neighbors’ piles of debris from the prior storm.“The water was something else last night,” Milton said. “We’ve never seen it flood so bad out here, to the point I could have swam out here last night, that’s just how deep it was.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/hurricane-delta-louisiana-rebuild-storm-aftermath-hurricane-laura-weather-lake-charles", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A debris field, fallen tree, and structure damage are seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Delta Saturday Oct. 10, 2020, in Gueydan, La.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/DeltaDamage_6.jpg"}, {"caption": "A truck drives through a flooded street in Lake Charles, La., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2020, past a home with damage from Hurricane Laura, after Hurricane Delta moved through on Friday.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/DeltaDamage_5.jpg"}, {"caption": "A truck drives through floodwaters in a neighborhood in Lake Charles, La., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2020, after Hurricane Delta moved through on Friday.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/DeltaDamage_4.jpg"}, {"caption": "Soncia King holds onto her husband Patrick King in Lake Charles, La., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2020, as they walk through the flooded street to their home, after Hurricane Delta moved through on Friday.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/DeltaDamage_3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Marcus Peterson walks past a downed tree in his yard after Hurricane Delta moved through, Saturday, Oct. 10, 2020, in Jennings, La.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/DeltaDamage_2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Ernest Jack moves near his home that was hit by Hurricane Laura ahead of Hurricane Delta, Friday, Oct. 9, 2020, in Lake Charles, La.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6566_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/DeltaDamage_1.jpg"}]}

The fires there have already burned an area equivalent to 23 times the size of New York City and will soon reach Bolivia.But the data only shows one part of the problem.Deforestation in the Amazon in 2019 was 85% higher than the previous year. The growth from August 2019 until July 2020 was 34%.

But what differs this year from other periods is actually done by human action.Loggers are burning the organic material left over from illegal deforestation done in 2019.According to Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), 45% of the deforested forest in 2019 was not burned last year and has been serving as fuel to increase the intensity of the fires in the Amazon.Batista says loggers have been stimulated by President Jair Bolsonaro, who has promised to reduce protected areas in Brazil, increase deforestation and stop the demarcation of indigenous regions. And he’s been keeping those promises.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6608_News_2>Last year, the president admitted to having \"potentialized\" loggers and farmers to light fires in the Brazilian Amazon. Last month, he announced the reduction of R$184 million ($33 million) in the budget for the Ministry of Environment.On Monday, its minister, Ricardo Salles, announced a new measure ending the protection of ecosystems such as mangroves and , present throughout the Brazilian coast.During a speech for the UN General Assembly for the United Nations (UN) last week, Bolsonaro accused the country’s indigenous population of being responsible for the fires in the Amazon and then blamed Venezuela.He said there is a \"campaign supported by shady interests\" by \"international institutions\" with \"Brazilian associations, profiteers, and unpatriotics.\" The objective, according to him, is to harm his government but didn’t provide any data to prove his accusations, strongly repelled by experts<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6608_News_3>Batista condemned the president’s remarks, saying that an estimated 90% of deforestation is done illegally by loggers and farmers.“Brazilian native population is one of the most fragile economically and in terms of protection by the state. They are essential for the preservation of forests and depend on it for their survival,” he said. “They are the population most affected by fires, deforestation, illegal mining, and the invasion by farmers of their territories. There is a public position of complete inaction restraining and punishing these attitudes, including decreasing funds for inspection. The speech is actually the opposite: to continue the destruction, but saying it is to invest more in the region.”Criticism from the international community against Bolsonaro’s environmental policies has gained steam recently.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders have already threatened to review, or even cancel, economic agreements with Brazil due to the increases in fires and deforestation.The German leader has expressed \"great concern\" over the \"dramatic\" situation under Bolsonaro’s administration on environmental and human rights issues.In April, more than 600 European scientists and about 300 indigenous people asked the European Union to link imports from Brazil to the protection of the environment and human rights. The request was made in a letter published in the scientific journal Science.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6608_News_4>Salles recently shared a video stating that the Amazon was not burning, which was proved a fake.Regarding the situation currently observed in the Pantanal, Salles admitted on Tuesday that fire in the region took on a \"gigantic\" proportion.“In fact, the damage to our fauna is great, the flora and the vegetation part is recovering, now it cannot be a fire of the gigantic proportion that is being so that we are fighting strongly,” he said in an interview to Radio Bandeirantes.The Amazon is an important carbon reservoir and fundamental in the regulation of rainfall, mainly in the Southern Hemisphere.“Amazon trees function as geysers, extracting water by the roots, taking their water through the trunk to the leaves, that (is) evaporated and then send water into the atmosphere,” said Antonio Nobre, a researcher at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon (INPA) and the National Institute for Space Research (INPE).<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6608_News_5>Likewise, Pantanal is home to several species of animals, such as the jaguar, the largest cat in the Americas.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/brazils-amazon-forest-precious-wetlands-burn-at-historic-levels", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6608_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Birds fly past as a fire consumes an area next to the Trans-Pantanal highway in the Pantanal wetlands near Pocone, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, Friday, Sept. 11, 2020.

A strong tropical storm across parts of the central Texas coastline, it's going to bring a lot of rain.\"According to forecasters at the NHC, Beta is forecast to slowly move towards the Texas coast and make landfall by Monday night.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6625_News_0>A tropical storm warning is in effect from Port Aransas, Texas to Morgan City, La., with a storm surge warning posted from Port Aransas to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana.Little change in strength is forecast before Beta reaches the Texas coast, and weakening is anticipated once the storm moves inland. Earlier predictions had Beta reaching hurricane strength before making landfall.Forecasters warn that through Thursday, Beta is expected to bring 8 to 12 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of 20 inches, from the middle Texas coast to southern Louisiana.\"Tropical Storm Beta is forecast to move very slowly toward the Texas coast over the next couple of days,\" the National Weather Sevice's Weather Prediction Center tweeted.  \"Heavy rain will likely lead to flash flooding  from the middle Texas coast to southern Louisiana.\"Beta's slow movement, including persistent winds, raised concerns about a dangerous storm surge and tide that could reach up to 4 feet in some areas.\"A lot of rain for some people,\" Reichmuth said on \"Fox & Friends.\"Coastal communities began preparing for Beta over the weekend, with the city of Galveston and Galveston County on Saturday issuing voluntary evacuation orders, along with the city of Seabrook.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6625_News_1>Mayor Pro Tem Craig Brown said in a statement that high tides and up to 10 inches of expected rainfall would leave roads impassable, especially along the city’s west end and low-lying areas.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6625_News_2>County Judge Mark Henry said during a Saturday news conference that his concern is also based on rising waters creating a storm surge and that a mandatory evacuation is not expected.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6625_News_3>“If you can survive in your home for three or four days without power and electricity, which we’re not even sure that’s going to happen, you’re OK,” Henry said. “If it’s uncomfortable or you need life-support equipment, maybe go somewhere else.”The storm system may bring more misery to Lake Charles, La., where thousands of people remain without power more than three weeks after Hurricane Laura slammed into the region.Donald Jones, a NWS meteorologist based in Lake Charles, said in a Saturday briefing that Beta could bring up to 20 inches of rain in parts of the area.“A lot of people have been saying, ‘Is this going to be like Harvey? Is this going to be like Imelda?'\" Jones said. “We’re not talking about rainfall totals yet that are on the orders of magnitude that we saw with that.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6625_News_4>Imelda, which struck southeast Texas in 2019, was one of the wettest cyclones on record while Harvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain on Houston in 2017. But if Beta slows down, rainfall totals could go higher than 20 inches“Harvey was a very specific and unique event, but we are talking about the same idea in terms of very heavy, heavy rainfall,\" he said.Beta is one of three named storms whirling in the Atlantic basin during an exceptionally busy hurricane season. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season has broken numerous records, as forecasters on Friday, ran out of traditional names and went to the Greek alphabet for storms Alpha and Beta.This was only the second time in history that hurricane center forecasters have had to pull out the Greek alphabet for names, with the last time being 2005.If the system makes landfall in Texas it would be the ninth named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. in 2020. Colorado State hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said that would tie a record set in 1916.Hurricane season starts June 1 and ends Nov. 30, but September historically produces the most Atlantic Ocean basin tropical activity.NOAA forecasters have been calling for up to 25 named storms this season with winds of 39 mph or higher; of those, seven to 10 could become hurricanes.

{"title": "2020 Atlantic hurricane season is running out of names, so what happens next?", "body": "A recent spate of activity for an already busy 2020 Atlantic hurricane season now means there's only one name left on the official list — but there's still several weeks to go.As of Tuesday, there have been 20 named storms out of a 21-name list, with only \"Wilfred\" remaining.Hurricane season starts June 1 and ends Nov. 30, but September historically produces the most Atlantic Ocean basin tropical activity. The currently named storms have each broken records for how early they formed for their respective letter, continuing a trend during the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season.On Monday we got the “T”- and \"V\"-named storms – Teddy and Vicky -- with one more to go until we get to the end of the list.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6680_News_0>With several weeks still to go, what happens if we run out of names?According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), once all 21 names are done, “additional storms will take names from the Greek alphabet.\"The names are given to storms by an international committee of the United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO).The only time the Greek alphabet has been used for storm names was back in 2005, when we had a total of 28 named storms, including the historic hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.According to the WMO, \"the National Hurricane Center had to use the Greek alphabet to name a tropical cyclone when the record-breaking Alpha formed\" in October 2005.The other Greek alphabet names used that year were Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Zeta.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6680_News_1>Another fact is that if a storm is particularly deadly or catastrophic, the name will be retired and replaced by the WMO. For example, you will never see a Hurricane Katrina again.But it bears noting that in 2006, the WMO decided since the Greek alphabet isn't used frequently enough and there are no changes proposed in the foreseeable future, that it's not practical to retire any of those rare names into hurricane history.\"It therefore decided that if a significant storm designated by a letter of the Greek Alphabet, in either the Atlantic or eastern North Pacific Basin, was considered worthy of being 'retired,' it would be included in the list of retired names with the year of occurrence and other details, but that the particular letter in the Greek Alphabet would continue to be available for use in the future,\" the WMO states.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6680_News_2>According to the NHC, hurricane names are categorized into six lists that are used in rotation and cycled every six years, so the 2019 list of names will be used again in 2025.Forecasters from the NHC said Monday they were issuing advisories on five tropical systems over the Atlantic basin.\"This ties the record for the most number of tropical cyclones in that basin at one time, last set in Sept 1971,\" the NHC tweeted.NOAA forecasters are now calling for up to 25 named storms this season with winds of 39 mph or higher; of those, seven to 10 could become hurricanes.

Schools and department stores were closed in Hiroshima and other cities in the country’s southwest.Damage caused by the typhoon was less than feared because it took a path farther from the coast and weakened more quickly than expected, officials said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6737_News_1>In South Korea, more than 100 homes were destroyed or flooded, while cars struggled to navigate flooded roads in Ulsan and other coastal cities such as Busan, Sokcho and Gangneung. Emergency workers scrambled to clean up toppled trees and damaged traffic signs, buildings, port facilities, and other structures.At least one person was missing after getting swept away by water that filled a drainage channel at a limestone mine in the eastern coastal town of Samcheok. Another person was found dead in Busan, but officials said it wasn’t immediately clear whether the death was caused by the typhoon.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6737_News_2>At least five people were hurt, including one in Busan who sustained light injuries after a car flipped over in strong winds, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said.The storm also destroyed or sank around 80 fishing boats, and caused generating turbines at two nuclear reactors in the southeastern city of Gyeongju to automatically stop. No leakage of radioactive materials was detected.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6737_News_3>Hundreds of flights in and out of the southern island province of Jeju and across the mainland were canceled. Some bridges and railroad sections were shut down, thousands of fishing boats and other vessels were moved to safety, and more than 2,600 residents in the southern mainland regions were evacuated due to the possibility of landslides and other concerns.Workers as of Monday afternoon had restored power to 49,643 of the 75,237 households that lost electricity in the southern mainland areas and Jeju.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6737_News_4>Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, plowed through Okinawa and other southern Japanese islands over the weekend. Traffic was still paralyzed in places, bullet train service was suspended and most domestic flights in and out of airports in southwestern Japan were canceled Monday.Regional officials in Miyazaki said rescue workers were looking for four people missing after a mudslide hit the mountainous village of Shiiba earlier Monday. A fifth person who was rescued at the site was seriously injured.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6737_News_5>Electricity was restored to thousands of homes in Japan, but more than 340,000 others were still without power. Nearly 4 million people in Japan were still advised to evacuate as of Monday afternoon.The storm by late Monday was expected to reach North Korea’s northeastern region, which was battered by Typhoon Maysak last week, inflicting further pain on an economy ravaged by U.S.-led sanctions, border closures from the coronavirus pandemic and chronic food shortages.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6737_News_6>North Korean TV aired video of widespread flooding in the eastern coastal city of Wonsan and nearby Tongchon, but the country’s state media didn’t immediately report any casualties caused by Haishen.The North’s state media earlier said leader Kim Jong Un visited typhoon-stricken areas, fired a top regional official for poor readiness, and promised to send 12,000 workers from Pyongyang to help with recovery efforts. The North said Maysak destroyed more than 1,000 houses and inundated public buildings and farmland.Maysak damaged roads and buildings and left at least one person dead in South Korea. In addition, a livestock cargo ship sank off Japan’s coast as Maysak passed. Two of its 43 crew members were rescued and one body was recovered before the search was halted because of Haishen.

{"title": "Amazon continues to burn in 2020 with wildfires despite promises to save it", "body": "A year ago this month, the forest around the town of Novo Progresso erupted into flames — the first major blazes in the Brazilian Amazon's dry season that ultimately saw more than 100,000 fires and spurred global outrage against the government’s inability or unwillingness to protect the rainforest.This year, President Jair Bolsonaro pledged to control the burning — typically started by local farmers to clear land for cattle or to grow soybeans, one of Brazil’s top exports. He imposed a four-month ban on most fires and sent in the army to prevent and battle blazes.But this week the smoke is again so thick around Novo Progresso that police have reported motorists have crashed because they can't see.As smoke wreaths Novo Progresso, this year's burning season could determine whether Bolsonaro, an avid supporter of bringing more farming and ranching to the Amazon, is willing and able to halt the fires. Experts say the blazes are pushing the world's largest rainforest toward a tipping point, after which it will cease to generate enough rainfall to sustain itself, and approximately two-thirds of the forest will begin an irreversible, decades-long decline into tropical savanna.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_0>But residents of Novo Progresso like businessman Claudio Herculano believe the city has only grown in the last few years because of increased ranching in the area.“It pains anyone to breathe this air,” Herculano, 68, said this week. “I have a little house uphill, and I do worry a bit that it could be destroyed. But all the people here are looking for better days, and we know what drives this economy.”Bolsonaro is sending mixed signals: He greenlit an army-led operation to fight Amazon destruction in May, but then this month he denied the region's trees can catch fire. Speaking at a video summit about the Amazon with fellow South American leaders, he also touted a year-on-year decrease in July deforestation data, omitting the fact it was still the third-highest reading for any month since 2015.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_1>“This story that the Amazon is burning is a lie,” he claimed, even as smoke from more than 1,100 fires wafted over the region that day.On Monday and Tuesday of this week, reporters from The Associated Press did not see a single soldier in or around Novo Progresso.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_2>And this year could see more fires than last, according to Paulo Barreto, a forest engineer and deforestation researcher at environmental group Imazon.At the start of the Amazon's dry season, in July, more trees had been felled, given that deforestation from August 2019 to July jumped 34% from the prior 12 months, according to preliminary data from Brazil’s space agency. Typically, after felling, the next step is burning, usually without the required authorization — since it's a far easier and cheaper way than using heavy machinery to clear brush and trees. Further, forest area degraded by logging — which is much more susceptible to wildfire than native forest — surged 465%, Barreto said.August and September are when the burning kicks into overdrive. And in the first half of August, satellites detected 19,000 fires across Brazil’s Amazon — putting the month on track to match August 2019's blazes that drew global outcry.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_3>The 2019 fires, while almost a 40% jump from the prior year, were only slightly higher than the average for the preceding decade. But Bolsonaro’s drive to reduce environmental protections to spur economic development coupled with the surge in deforestation had primed the world for outrage. Some of Europe's heads of state railed against Bolsonaro or suggested pulling funding, and its lawmakers threatened to refuse ratification of the free-trade deal Brazil spent two decades negotiating. Brazil's agribusiness exporters feared boycotts, and asset managers considered divesting from Brazilian companies.Bolsonaro dispatched the Army to help smother the flames — and the criticism — in late August 2019.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_4>Last year's blazes also triggered a federal police investigation into what became known as the Day of Fire — when several fires were set. They are seeking to determine if a group of ranchers had coordinated the burning on messaging app WhatsApp.In October, they sent their initial findings to a federal judge in the Amazon city of Itaituba, requesting an extension of their probe’s deadline, according to Sérgio Pimenta, the police detective overseeing the investigation.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_5>Last Thursday — almost 10 months later — the judge granted the request, without providing an explanation for the delay, Pimenta said. The judge's office declined to comment.The episode underscored how difficult it is to bring charges in such cases, according to Paulo Moreira, the public prosecutor on the Amazon task force whose jurisdiction includes Novo Progresso.“The sense of impunity is very large,” Moreira said by phone.Joaquim da Silva, a rancher in Novo Progresso, says the problem is that many lack title to the land they use — and that makes it easier for them to avoid punishment even as they destroy with reckless abandon. His own neighbor set fires days earlier.“He bypassed the law, did what he wanted, used a chain saw, tore everything down,” da Silva, 59, told the AP, as he stood on his own 22-hectare (54-acre) farm. \"He doesn't care.”Ranchers are also making headway into virgin forest. Novo Progresso — meaning New Progress in Portuguese — is adjacent to the Jamanxim National Forest and environmental protection area, both of which have been chipped away at by deforestation; from above, they appear to be disintegrating.The Amazon has lost about 17% of its original area and, at the current pace, will reach a tipping point in the next 15 to 30 years, said Carlos Nobre, a prominent climatologist. As it decomposes, it will release hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, making it “very difficult” to meet the Paris Agreement’s climate goals, said Nobre, senior scientist with the University of Sao Paulo’s Institute of Advanced Studies.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_6>He added signs of change are emerging already: The dry season in the southern third of the Amazon — where Novo Progresso is located — has reached nearly four months, up from three months in the 1980s. It’s grown hotter, too.Novo Progresso’s 25,000 residents occupy an area bigger than New Jersey and Connecticut combined, making it one of Brazil’s largest and most sparsely populated municipalities. Pick-up trucks and motorcycles kick up dirt on its roads lined with small shops and evangelical churches. Entering its dusty downtown from the south, one is greeted by a billboard of Bolsonaro that says he supports development. It was paid for by farmers; he won the area in a landslide in the 2018 election.This year, Bolsonaro sent troops in ahead of the dry season, in May — but Vice President Hamilton Mourão has said that deployment was six months too late to rein in 2020 deforestation. Still, the so-called Operation Green Brazil 2 will reduce fires, according to Mourão, who is leading it.Eleven government bodies are coordinating the operation, which includes 3,400 soldiers and 269 agents from allied agencies, who have handed out 442 million reais ($82 million) in fines and seized about 700 chain saws and 28,000 cubic meters (36,600 cubic yards) of wood, as well as more than 500 boats and 200 cars, according to the Defense Ministry.“We’re going to proceed with this type of work until the end of 2022, or until the group that deforests realizes this can’t be done any more,” Mourão, a retired general, said last month.It's not clear whether these efforts will be enough to calm the global backlash. Izabella Teixeira, who was the environment minister in a leftist Workers' Party government, told the AP the government has yet to prove it has changed its Amazon stance.“It is starting a new phase,\" she said. \"If it is credible, if it is efficient and permanent, we will need to evaluate over the next 12 months.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/amazon-brazil-wildfire-2020-fire-burn-major-blaze-save-conservation", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Flames travel along the floor of a field near Novo Progresso, Para state, Brazil, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/amazon_4.jpg"}, {"caption": "Clouds of smoke billow from a field consumed by fire near Novo Progresso, Para state, Brazil, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/amazon_3.jpg"}, {"caption": "An aerial view of an area consumed by fire and cleared near Novo Progresso in Para state, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/amazon_7.jpg"}, {"caption": "Workers from Brazil's state-run environment agency IBAMA check an area consumed by fire near Novo Progresso, Para state, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/amazon_5.jpg"}, {"caption": "A man rides a motorbike pulling a cart along a paved dirt road in an area scorched by fires near Labrea, Amazonas state, Brazil, Friday, Aug. 7, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/amazon-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this Sept. 3, 2019, file photo, Brazilian soldier puts out fires at the Nova Fronteira region in Novo Progresso, Brazil.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/amazon_6.jpg"}, {"caption": "A family rides along a paved dirt road in an area scorched by fires near Labrea, Amazonas state, Brazil, Friday, Aug. 7, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6883_News_6", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/amazon_2.jpg"}]}

{"title": "North Korea nuclear complex may have been damaged by recent flooding, US think tank says", "body": "Significant flooding along a river in North Korea that runs near the country's main nuclear facility may have resulted in damage to the complex, a U.S.-based monitoring website said Thursday.Analysts at 38 North, a Washington-based think tank specializing in North Korea studies, said that commercial satellite imagery from Aug. 6 to Aug. 11 showed that floodwaters along the Kuryong River had \"reached the two pump houses that service the reactors\" at Yongbyon nuclear complex.\"The August 6 imagery, when compared to imagery from July 22, shows a dramatic rise in the water level of the Kuryong River that flows alongside the Yongbyon complex,\" the group said.The Yongbyon complex is located about 60 miles north of Pyongyang and is the location of nuclear reactors, fuel reprocessing plants and uranium enrichment facilities that are thought to be used in the country’s nuclear weapons program.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6908_News_0>The complex is home to a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor believed to be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium.The think tank on Thursday released an image of a fully submerged dam along the river, highlighting that the flooding could potentially damage the pumps or clog piping systems that draw water from the river, causing the reactor to shut down.38 North noted that although the reactor does not appear to have been operating for quite some time and an Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR) has yet to come online, both would need consistent water flow to operate.“Damage to the pumps and piping within the pump houses presents the biggest vulnerability to the reactors,” the report said. “If the reactors were operating, for instance, the inability to cool them would require them to be shut down.”Satellite data from earlier this week shows that waters have receded and that there did not appear to be any damage to key facilities such as the Uranium Enrichment Plant (UEP), the think tank added.South Korea's Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the report, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.\"Our military is always closely monitoring the North's nuclear and missile activities, and the authorities of South Korea and the United States are keeping a close cooperation system,\" deputy ministry spokesperson Col.

{"title": "Lebanon prime minister resigns after Cabinet steps down amid fallout of Beirut explosion", "body": "Lebanon's Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced at a news conference Monday he's resigning just hours after his entire Cabinet stepped down amid the fallout of last week's devastating explosion at Beirut's port.He said he is taking “a step back” so he can stand with the people “and fight the battle for change alongside them.”“I declare today the resignation of this government. May God protect Lebanon,”  Diab said, repeating the last phrase three times.The resignations came a day after the death toll climbed to more than 200 people.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6925_News_0>Earlier Monday, Lebanese health minister, Hamad Hassan, told reporters at the end of a Cabinet meeting that Diab would head to the presidential palace to “hand over the resignation in the name of all the ministers.”“The whole government resigned,” Hamad said.After large, violent demonstrations were seen in Beirut over the weekend involving security forces firing tear gas at protesters, another protest was planned outside the Baabda Palace on Monday, as the Lebanese people also called for President Michel Aoun to step down, Reuters reported. It was not immediately clear if Aoun would cede to their demands.During his farewell address Monday, Diab blamed corrupt politicians who preceded him for the “earthquake” that has hit Lebanon.“They should have been ashamed of themselves because their corruption is what has led to this disaster that had been hidden for seven years,” he added.Protesters blame the country's ruling class for corruption and negligence that led to the blast. On Saturday, Diab had offered to push for early elections. Meanwhile, Iran, which backs the Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah that's infiltrated Lebanon's government, warned world leaders not to politicize the devastation seen after the explosion in Beirut.“It won’t work, it’s just the same people. It’s a mafia,” Antoinette Baaklini, an employee at an electrical company destroyed by the explosion said, referencing proposed government reforms.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6925_News_1>Lebanon’s information minister, Manal Abdel Samad, was the first to quit on Sunday in the aftermath of the explosion that left some 6,000 people wounded and another 300,000 people homeless. She was followed by Lebanon’s environmental minister, Demianos Kattar, who also stepped down Sunday.Lebanon’s justice minister, Marie-Claude Najm, became the third Cabinet member to resign within 24 hours on Monday, the state news agency reported. While trying to visit a damaged neighborhood over the weekend, she was met with shouted insults, sprayed by water hoses, and forced to leave.Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud said the death toll from the explosion had risen to at least 220 people as of Sunday, while another 110 people remain missing, the BBC reported. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6925_News_2>President Trump joined an international donor call on Sunday hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. World leaders and international organizations pledged nearly $300 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Beirut in the wake of the explosion but warned that no money for rebuilding the capital would be made available until Lebanese authorities commit themselves to the political and economic reforms demanded by the people.The massive blast on Aug. 4 has brought a new wave of public outrage at the government and Lebanon’s long-entrenched ruling class. The explosion, centered at Beirut port, is believed to have been caused by a fire that ignited a 2,750-ton stockpile of explosive ammonium nitrate. The material had been stored at the port since 2013 with few safeguards despite numerous warnings of the danger.The result was a disaster Lebanese blame squarely on their leadership’s corruption and neglect. Losses from the blast are estimated to be between $10 billion to $15 billion. Public Prosecutor Ghassan El Khoury began questioning Maj. Gen. Tony Saliba, the head of Lebanon’s State Security, according to state-run National News Agency. The outlet gave no further details, but other generals are scheduled to be questioned. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6925_News_3>About 20 people have been detained over the blast, including the head of Lebanon’s customs department and his predecessor, as well as the head of the port. Dozens of people have been questioned, including two former Cabinet ministers, according to government officials.Iran meanwhile expressed concern that Western countries and their allies might exploit anger over the explosion to pursue their political interests. Iran supports the Hezbollah militant group, which along with its allies dominates Lebanon’s government and parliament.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said “it is natural for people to be frustrated.” But he said it would be “unacceptable if some individuals, groups and foreign countries use the incident as a pretext for their purposes and intentions.”Israel’s defense minister drew a line Monday between the blast and claims that Hezbollah stores its rockets and weapons deep inside civilian areas. While he did not accuse Hezbollah and its arms of being linked to the blast, Benny Gantz said villages and towns across Lebanon were packed with Hezbollah arms that if set off — whether by Israeli operations or by accident — would destroy homes. He said Hezbollah was Lebanon’s biggest problem.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/beirut-explosion-prime-minister-resignations-cabinet-lebanon", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6925_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In this March. 7, 2020 file photo released by the Lebanese Government, Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab, gives a speech at the Government House in Beirut, Lebanon.

{"title": "Hiroshima survivors mark 75th anniversary of attack, urge ban on nuclear weapons", "body": "HIROSHIMA, Japan — Survivors of the world’s first atomic bombing gathered in diminished numbers near an iconic, blasted dome Thursday to mark the attack’s 75th anniversary, many of them urging the world, and their own government, to do more to ban nuclear weapons.An upsurge of coronavirus cases in Japan meant a much smaller than normal turnout, but the bombing survivors’ message was more urgent than ever. As their numbers dwindle — their average age is about 83 — many nations have bolstered or maintained their nuclear arsenals, and their own government refuses to sign a nuclear weapons ban treaty.Amid cries of Japanese government hypocrisy, survivors, their relatives and officials marked the 8:15 a.m. blast anniversary with a minute of silence.The United States dropped the world’s first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people, and a second one three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered Aug. 15, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression in Asia.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6944_News_0>But the decades since have seen the weapons stockpiling of the Cold War and a nuclear standoff among nations that continues to this day.Amid the solemn remembrances at Hiroshima’s peace park, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was confronted Thursday by six members of survivors’ groups over the treaty.“Could you please respond to our request to sign the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty?” Tomoyuki Mimaki, a member of a major survivors’ group, Hidankyo, implored Abe. “The milestone 75th anniversary of the atomic bombing is a chance” to change course.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6944_News_1>Abe insisted on Japan’s policy not to sign the treaty, vaguely citing a “different approach,” though he added that the government shares the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.“Abe’s actions don’t seem to match his words,” said Manabu Iwasa, 47, who came to the park to pray for his father, a bombing survivor who died at age 87 in March. “Japan apparently sides with the United States, but it should make more efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons. It’s frustrating, but there is not much we individuals can do.”Even though Tokyo renounces its own possession, production, or hosting of nuclear weapons, Japan is a top U.S. ally, hosts 50,000 American troops and is protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. This complicates the push to get Tokyo to sign the treaty adopted in 2017, especially as it steps up its military role amid North Korea’s continuing pursuit of a stronger nuclear program.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6944_News_2>Abe, in his speech at the ceremony, said a nuclear-free world cannot be achieved overnight and it has to start with dialogue.“Japan’s position is to serve as a bridge between different sides and patiently promote their dialogue and actions to achieve a world without nuclear weapons,” Abe said.Earlier, Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui urged world leaders to more seriously commit to nuclear disarmament, pointing out Japan’s failures.“I ask the Japanese government to heed the appeal of the (bombing survivors) to sign, ratify and become a party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,” Matsui said in his peace declaration. “As the only nation to suffer a nuclear attack, Japan must persuade the global public to unite with the spirit of Hiroshima.”Thursday’s peace ceremony at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was scaled down because of the coronavirus pandemic. The fewer than 1,000 attendees were one-tenth of those attending in past years.Some survivors and their relatives prayed at the park’s cenotaph before the ceremony. The registry of the atomic bombing victims is stored at the cenotaph, whose inscription reads, “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the mistake.””The only way to totally eliminate nuclear risk is to totally eliminate nuclear weapons,” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a video message from New York for the occasion. Guterres’ expected visit to Hiroshima had to be canceled because of the coronavirus.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6944_News_3>“Seventy-five years is far too long not to have learned that the possession of nuclear weapons diminishes, rather than reinforces, security,” he said. “Today, a world without nuclear weapons seems to be slipping further from our grasp.”An aging group of survivors, known as hibakusha, feel a growing urgency to tell their stories, in hopes of reaching a younger generation.Many peace events, including their talks, leading up to the anniversary were canceled because of the coronavirus, but some survivors have teamed with students or pacifist groups to speak at online events, sometimes connecting with international audiences.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6944_News_4>The bombing’s survivors lamented the slow progress of nuclear disarmament and expressed anger over what they said was the Japanese government’s reluctance to help and listen to those who suffered. They want world leaders, especially those from nuclear-weapons states, to visit Hiroshima and see the reality of the atomic bombing.Keiko Ogura, 84, who survived the atomic bombing at age 8, wants non-nuclear states to pressure Japan into signing the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty.“Many survivors are offended by the prime minister of this country because he does not sign the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty,” said Ogura.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/hiroshima-75th-anniversary", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6944_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A man prays in front of the cenotaph for the atomic bombing victims before the start of ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the bombing in Hiroshima, western Japan, early Thursday, Aug. 6, 2020.

{"title": "Beirut explosion: France's Macron promises foreign aid won't fall into 'corrupt hands' as outrage mounts over negligent Lebanon 'regime'", "body": "As outraged protesters gathered in central Beirut on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron assured that foreign aid dollars would not fall into corrupt hands on the second day since a massive explosion devastated the Lebanese capital, leaving so far at least 157 dead and 5,000 injured. \"I guarantee you this - aid will not go to corrupt hands,\" Macron, the first world leader to visit the city since Tuesday’s blast, told a crowd calling for an end to the Lebanese “regime,” according to Al Jazeera. “I will talk to all political forces to ask them for a new pact. I am here today to propose a new political pact to them.\"Volunteers and the Lebanese Red Cross continued to search for survivors and dead bodies trapped beneath the extensive damage seen for miles away from the explosion’s epicenter at the Port of Beirut, where Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab said 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilizers, came to be stored at the facility for six years. Public anger mounted against the Lebanese ruling elite that is being blamed for the chronic mismanagement and carelessness that led to the disaster. The port and customs office is notorious for being one of the most corrupt and lucrative institutions in Lebanon where various factions and politicians, including Hezbollah, hold sway.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6943_News_0>Badri Daher, director-general of Lebanese customs, told local media on Wednesday that his office sent six letters to the country’s judiciary over the years expressing concern over the ammonium nitrate stored at the port since it was confiscated from a ship in 2013. He had been asking whether he should export the cargo, sell it or hand it over to the Army.The Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, entered the Port of Beirut after experiencing technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique. It was later abandoned by its Russian owner and mostly Ukrainian crew, prompting a lawsuit from creditors.An unspecified number of port officials were placed on house arrest on Wednesday pending an investigation by the Lebanese government that is expected to take five days. Humans Rights Watch called for an independent probe into the blast, citing \"serious concerns about the ability of the Lebanese judiciary to conduct a credible and transparent investigation on its own,” the BBC reported. Amnesty International Acting Secretary-General Julie Verhaar echoed calls for “an international mechanism to be promptly set up to investigate how this happened,” The Guardian reported. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6943_News_1>The Lebanese Army stepped in Wednesday to assume security operations in the capital amid a two-week state of emergency. Losses from the blast are estimated to be between $10 billion to $15 billion, Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud told Saudi-owned TV station Al-Hadath, adding that nearly 300,000 people are homeless. Dozens of people remain missing, as the death toll is expected to climb. “They went down, thinking it was caused by fireworks,” one firefighter named Freddy said of his colleagues who first responded to a fire that ravaged the warehouse at the Port of Beirut before the following explosion rang out. “We were looking for our friends but there were also lots of people dead. It is total destruction inside. Nothing is where it should be.”Australia pledged an initial 2 million Australian dollars ($1.4 million) to the relief effort in Lebanon. France, Russia, Germany and China were also sending search-and-rescue teams as well as doctors and specialists to treat the wounded. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6943_News_2>The U.S. Embassy in Beirut said at least one American citizen was killed and several more were injured. More than 100 U.N. staff members and dependents were injured, and two family members of U.N. staffers were killed. At least 22 members of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon were among the injured.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas confirmed Thursday that an embassy employee was found to be killed inside her home in Beirut in the aftermath of the explosion, Reuters reported.As international aid flights began to arrive in Lebanon, hospitals, already struggling with the financial crisis and coronavirus pandemic, were overwhelmed by the wave of injured. Many patients had to be treated in hallways and parking lots once the wards filled up.Some of the worst damage was in the leafy neighborhoods of Mar Mikhael and Gemayzeh in east Beirut, where the blast damaged some of the few historic buildings that survived the 1975-1990 civil war. <IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6943_News_3>Balconies had dropped to street level, where bars and restaurants were buried and chairs and tables turned upside down. Nuns toured the churches along the streets, offering prayers and help. Supermarket owners filled plastic bags with the few remaining products in good shape— one saying he will take what is left home to use before it rots in the summer heat.“Who will pay for this? This is not fixable,” Shiva Karout, whose gym, Barbell House, was destroyed by the explosion, told the Associated Press. “Beirut is already gone.”Throughout the night, radio presenters read the names of missing or wounded people. An Instagram page called “Locating Victims Beirut” sprung up with photos of missing people. Another account helped to connect the newly displaced with hotels and homeowners who were willing to host them.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6943_News_4>Tuesday’s explosion comes 15 years after a car bomb exploded not far from Beirut’s port, killing former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others in 2005.A United Nations tribunal was expected to hand down its verdict this week for the four alleged Hezbollah members accused in the assassination, but the Hague, Netherlands-based court said in a statement it would delay the announcement “out of respect for the countless victims of the devastating explosion that shook Beirut on 4 August, and the three days of public mourning in Lebanon.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/beirut-explosion-france-macron-lebanon-corrupt-hands", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_6943_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Citizens ride their scooters and motorcycles pass in front of a house that was destroyed in Tuesday's massive explosion in the seaport of Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, Aug. 5, 2020.

{"title": "Australia wildfires 'killed or displaced' nearly 3 billion animals, declared among 'worst wildlife disasters' in history", "body": "The devastating wildfire season in Australia that stretched from last July through March impacted far more animals than previously estimated, scientists said Tuesday in a new report.The fires caused widespread destruction and mass evacuations in the eastern part of the country towards the end of 2019, killing 33 people in all and destroying more than 3,000 homes.But the toll on animals was far more devastating, according to a report commission by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Nearly 3 billion animals -- including mammals, reptiles, birds and frogs -- were killed or displaced during the bushfire season.“The interim findings are shocking,\" WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman said in a statement. \"It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6997_News_0>In the interim report, 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs are believed to have been impacted, which is almost three times an earlier estimate released in January.\"When you think about nearly 3 billion native animals being in the path of the fires it is absolutely huge. It’s a difficult number to comprehend,” said University of Sydney Professor Chris Dickman, the scientist overseeing the project by 10 scientists from Australian universities.Scientists cannot come to a firm number on how many animals may have perished in the flames. According to Dickman, the prospects for animals that escaped the flames were “probably not that great” because of a lack of food and shelter in addition to being forced into habitat already occupied.The earlier report from January, scientists only focused on the states of New South Wales and Victoria. New South Wales, which sits on the east coast of Australia and is home to the city of Sydney, was the worst affected state in the country during the last bushfire season, but there were fires recorded in every Australian state.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6997_News_1>Lily Van Eeden, who is leading the project, said the latest estimates takes in a much larger area about 11.46 million hectares, an area around the size of England.\"We believe a continent-wide assessment of the number of animals that might be impacted has never been done in Australia before or anywhere else in the world,\" Van Eeden said in a statement. \"Other nations can build upon this research to improve understanding of bushfire impacts everywhere.\"While the final report will be completed by the end of August 2020, recommendations in the interim report include identifying and protecting unburnt habitat crucial to threatened species, improving fire prevention and management, and establishing rapid response teams to help species impacted by fires.Australia's government has pledged some $35 million to wildlife and habitat recovery, but environmentalists have called on the country to strengthen conservation laws, according to the BBC.A royal commission inquiry into the fires is due to report its findings in October.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6997_News_2>The fires began causing widespread destruction toward the end of 2019, which was both the hottest and driest year in Australia's recorded history, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Authorities told Fox News at the time the blazes were the perfect storm of a number of disturbing factors.The blazes damaged World Heritage Areas, including the Blue Mountains and the Gondwana rainforests in New South Wales and Queensland, officials said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_6997_News_3>More than 200 U.S. firefighters were sent to Australia to fight bushfires for the first time since 2010.

{"title": "Kim Jong Un puts North Korean city on lockdown over suspected coronavirus case, says 'vicious virus' may be in country", "body": "After claiming for months that North Korea has no coronavirus cases, dictator Kim Jong Un placed a border city on lockdown after a person was discovered with suspected symptoms, state media reported Sunday.North Korea's Central News Agency said Kaesong near the border with South Korea has been shut down after Kim believed the \"vicious virus\" may have entered the country.Kim said he took “the preemptive measure of totally blocking Kaesong City and isolating each district and region from the other\" on Friday afternoon, the state-run news agency said.According to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, O Chun-bok, North Korea's minister of public health, underscored the situation in a news broadcast on Korean Central Television.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7007_News_0>\"In the past six months since the outbreak of infectious diseases, strong emergency measures have been taken on all fronts across the country,\" O said. \"Despite the efforts, it appears that a dangerous crisis has occurred in which the virus may have entered our borders.\"State media said the suspected COVID-19 patient is a runaway who fled to South Korea three years ago before illegally returning early last week.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7007_News_1>North Korea said respiratory secretion and blood tests showed the person “is suspected to have been infected” with the coronavirus and has since been quarantined.People who had been in contact with the patient and those who have been in Kaesong in the last five days were also quarantined.NK News, an organization that tracks North Korean state-run media, said the person crossed the border on July 19. At a meeting on July 24, top North Korean leadership shifted to a “maximum emergency system” and agreed to put out a “top-class alert.”If the person is officially declared a coronavirus patient, he or she would be North Korea’s first confirmed case. As the coronavirus has spread globally and shut down various countries this year, North Korea has steadfastly said it has had no cases of the virus, a claim questioned by outside experts.\"It's impossible for North Korea not to have a single case of coronavirus,\" Jung H. Pak, a former CIA analyst on North Korea, told Fox News in March.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7007_News_2>The Hermit Kingdom has repeatedly said there hasn’t been a single case on its soil but implemented social distancing measures back in April. North Korea also received $900,000 from the World Health Organization in the spring to fight the virus.In late March, the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported more than 100 North Korean soldiers who were stationed at the border with China died from the virus. The South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo also claimed that Kim was spending \"considerable time\" away from the capital of Pyongyang due to the virus.Describing its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” North Korea earlier this year shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned foreign tourists and mobilized health workers to quarantine anyone with symptoms.After Kim Jong Un disappeared from public view for weeks in the spring before reemerging, reports also circulated he was concerned about the virus.The Kaesong lockdown, however, is the first known measure taken in a North Korean city to stem the pandemic.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7007_News_3>Kaesong, with an estimated population of 200,000, is located just north of the heavily fortified border with South Korea. It once hosted the Koreas’ jointly run industrial complex, which has been shuttered since 2016 amid nuclear tensions.Last month, North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong to protest a campaign by South Korean activists who have been sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.One analyst said the announcement Sunday by North Korea was important for several reasons.“It’s an ice-breaking moment for North Korea to admit a case,” Choo Jae-woo, a professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, told Reuters. “It could be reaching out to the world for help. Perhaps for humanitarian assistance.”During an emergency Politburo meeting Saturday, state media said Kim criticized the “loose guard performance” at the border area where the suspected patient crossed over.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7007_News_4>Kim and other leaders were reportedly briefed on the results of an intensive investigation of a military unit responsible for the crossing and discussed administering “a severe punishment.”More than 33,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea over the past 20 years to avoid poverty and political suppression, mostly via China.

{"title": "Devastating China flooding puts controversial Three Gorges Dam under new scrutiny", "body": "The second-highest rainfall that's swamped China in more than a half-century has fueled new questions about the world's biggest hydroelectric facility, billed as helping to tame floodwaters.Since last month, at least 141 people have died and around 28,000 homes have been damaged in the Yangtze River region, affecting virtually all of mainland China.Vice Minister of Emergency Management Zheng Guoguang told reporters on Monday that the Yangtze, Asia's longest river, and parts of its watershed have seen the second-highest rainfall since 1961 over the past six months.But after weeks of devastating flooding, questions are being raised about the Three Gorges Dam's impact on Yangtze floods and if the massive structure itself may be at risk.“One of the major justifications for the Three Gorges Dam was flood control, but less than 20 years after its completion we have the highest floodwater in recorded history,” David Shankman, a geographer with the University of Alabama who studies Chinese floods, told Reuters. “The fact is that it cannot prevent these severe events.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7035_News_0>The Three Gorges Dam was completed officially in 2006. Its power operation went online in 2012, and it is one of China’s most expensive and questionable developmental projects.Some 1.4 million people had to be resettled as a result of the huge project on the Yangtze River.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7035_News_1>The dam also was touted as the best way to end centuries of flooding along the Yangtze and provide power for China's industrial boom. But some geologists contended that damming up too much water in the reservoir carried a heightened risk of earthquakes and prolonged damage to the river's ecology.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7035_News_2>In 2012, the Ministry of Land Resources said the number of landslides and other disasters around the reservoir had increased 70 percent after the water level in the $23 billion project rose to its maximum in 2010.Critics of the project, like Chinese geologist Fan Xiao, have said that Three Gorges and other major dam projects may make flooding worse by altering the flow of sedimentation down the river. He told Reuters that at Three Gorges, the storage capacity amounts to less than 9 percent of average floodwaters.“It can only partially and temporarily intercept the upstream floods, and is powerless to help with floods caused by heavy rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,” he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7035_News_3>Damage from this season's floods has been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, further pressuring an economy deeply impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7035_News_4>Hubei province, through which the Yangtze flows, is known for its numerous lakes and rivers and is under particular threat.

Ben Evardone of Eastern Samar province, where the typhoon slammed ashore, said distraught residents wept after their houses were destroyed or blown away in the towns he inspected. One villager who lost his home slashed his wrist but was treated in time, he said.A man bled to death after he was hit by glass shards in a school building he was trying to open to take shelter in, Evardone said.“The damage I saw was very extensive. The roof of one church was ripped off completely, its iron bars twisted badly by the typhoon,” Evardone said by telephone.Videos and pictures of the devastation sent by Evardone showed several low-slung buildings and sports centers either destroyed or badly damaged with their roofs peeled off or deformed and their iron trusses bent. Villagers outside damaged houses yelled “help” in one video.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7183_News_0>He said he and a group of military, police, and local authorities failed to reach two towns hit by the typhoon, Jipapad, and Maslog, due to fallen trees on the road.

Vongfong was expected to blow out of the country’s north on Sunday.Office of Civil Defense Director Claudio Yucot said the evacuations took time because workers needed to wear masks and protective suits and could not transport villagers to shelters in large numbers as a safeguard against the virus.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7183_News_3>“Our ease of movement has been limited by COVID,” Yucot said by telephone from Albay province in the Bicol region, which has had dozens of coronavirus infections, including four deaths, and remains under quarantine. “In the evacuation centers, there are more challenges.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7183_News_4>In an evacuation room which normally could shelter up to 40 families, only four families could be accommodated. The occupants should know each other and are required to report any infected person, Yucot said.The coast guard said more than 600 cargo truck drivers and workers were stranded by the travel suspension. All were required to wear masks and prohibited from mingling.The typhoon hit as the Philippines struggles to deal with coronavirus outbreaks, largely with a lockdown in Luzon that is to be eased this weekend, except in metropolitan Manila and two other high-risk areas.

{"title": "Coronavirus may impact weather forecasts as aircraft measurements have 'plummeted' due to pandemic", "body": "The coronavirus pandemic that has caused a freefall in air travel around the globe is also having a noticeable impact on the \"quantity and quality\" of weather observations and forecasts worldwide, according to a leading group.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said last week that the number of meteorological measurements taken by aircraft has \"plummeted\" by an average of 75 to 80 percent compared to normal as COVID-19 has spread globally.\"As we approach the Atlantic hurricane season, the COVID-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge and may exacerbate multi-hazard risks at a single country level,\" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. \"Therefore it is essential that governments pay attention to their national early warning and weather observing capacities.\"While the group said that measurements from aircraft have dropped up to 80 percent compared to normal, notable regional variations were apparent.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7201_News_0>Data losses closer to 90 percent were reported in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in places such as Africa in addition to parts of Central and South America, where the WMO noted many weather stations rely on manual operation rather than automatic.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7201_News_1>One of the main sources of aircraft-based weather observations to use in forecasts is the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay Program (AMDAR) by the WMO. The WMO is an arm of the United Nations that coordinates a global observing system for 193 member nations.The AMDAR system uses sensors and communications systems from existing aircraft carrying travelers to collect, format, and transmit meteorological data from forecast winds at cruising altitudes. The information arrives at ground stations by either satellite or radio links.But as coronavirus spread through Europe and travel restrictions were enacted in March, the amount of data from aircraft being used to go into weather models plummeted.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7201_News_2>The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting said at the time that aircraft reports are provided by airlines in the U.S., because of the \"particularly dense coverage\" of aircraft in the skies of America. The European center noted that between March 3 and 23, aircraft-generated weather reports across Europe dropped by 65 percent, while there was also a 42 percent drop globally.Forecasters in Europe noted that a small proportion of aircraft reports come from cargo flights, which are less affected by COVID-19 than passenger flights.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7201_News_3>The WMO said Thursday that large parts of the observing system, including satellite components and many ground-based observing networks, are automated to a degree. But there is concern that if the pandemic drags on that they will miss out on critical repair, maintenance, and supply work.In response to the drop in data, the group noted that some countries are launching extra radiosondes, which are flown on weather balloons, to partly mitigate the loss of aircraft observations. The practice is being done particularly in Europe.\"Radiosondes are flown on weather balloons and transmit measurements critical meteorological variables back to the ground during their flight from the surface up to altitudes of 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 18 miles),\" the WMO noted.The WMO currently uses 30 meteorological satellites and 200 research satellites, which provide continuous, highly-automated observations.In addition to the satellites, there are also more than 10,000 completely automated and unmanned surface weather stations on Earth.As major carriers also cut flights in the U.S. due to the pandemic, American forecast counterparts such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the U.S. forecast model known as the GFS, also noted impacts from fewer planes in the sky.“We are anticipating the substantial reduction in the availability of US AMDAR data to continue over the coming weeks, likely to generate some measure of impact on the output of our numerical weather prediction systems,” NOAA's Christopher Hill said in an ECMWF news release in March.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/coronavirus-weather-forecast-meteorological-measurement-plummeted-aircraft-grounded", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7201_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Aircraft-based operations across the globe in a 24-hour period as seen on Jan, 31, 2020.

The Russian Air Force directed military jets to drop guided bombs on the blockage along the Sukhona River every hour until the river resumed its natural flow, which could be seen in videos posted to YouTube.Scott told the Edmonton Journal that the possibility of military intervention was considered, but would not work for this \"one-in-one-hundred-year flood.\"“It’s the sheer size of the ice jam itself that prevents the military from using explosives,” Scott told the paper.Kenney addressed the topic of military intervention on Monday in a video posted to Twitter.\"Apparently that was a tactic used back in 1972 and our river experts have looked at that very closely and are saying that would just not work in this situation,\" he said. \"It would not displace the ice, it would just create tighter jams in some places.\"Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon said Tuesday the danger will only subside when warmer weather melts the massive ice jams, according to CBC News.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7226_News_4>\"Ice-jam floods are very unpredictable and conditions can change quickly with little warning,\" he told reporters at a news conference in Edmonton. \"There is no reasonable engineering solution to unlock the ice jams at this point.

{"title": "Kim Jong Un's train spotted on satellite images amid rumors of North Korean dictator's ill health", "body": "The signature train belonging to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been spotted on satellite images parked at a station on the nation's eastern coast since last week, according to a U.S. monitor, as questions swirl over the dictator's health.Since Kim missed an April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of his grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, unverified reports have emerged about his health.On Sunday, a key aide to the president of South Korea insisted Kim, who is believed to be 36, was \"alive and well.\"\"Our government position is firm,\" Chung-in Moon, foreign policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told Fox News. \"Kim Jong Un is alive and well. He has been staying in the Wonsan area since April 13. No suspicious movements have so far been detected.\"Satellite photos released on Saturday echo South Korean government intelligence that Kim is staying outside of the capital, Pyongyang. The photos released by 38 North, a Washington-based website specializing in North Korea studies, show that activity has increased in the resort town of Wonsan in April.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_0>Kim Jong Un's train has been parked at the Leadership Railway Station servicing his Wonsan compound since at least April 21, the website 38 North said Saturday, citing an analysis of recent satellite photos of the area.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_1>The railway station in Wonsan is reserved for use by the Kim family.The website said the approximately 820-foot-long train wasn’t present on April 15, but was present on both April 21 and 23.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_2>\"The train’s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health, but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country’s eastern coast,\" the group said.The photos indicate the train arrived before April 21 and was still present on April 23, when it appeared to be repositioned for departure.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_3>\"However, there was no indication when that departure might take place,\" the group said.North Korea's dictator has taken his distinct armored green and yellow train to recent summits in Russia and Vietnam.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_4>Kim’s preferred travel method is by train — like his late father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung. Kim’s father loathed flying and made all his trips abroad, almost all to China, by rail.The train cars are reportedly bulletproof, making them heavier than normal carriages — and much slower when traveling, according to a 2009 report by Chosun Ilbo. It travels an average speed of 37 mph.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_5>The train, originally owned by Kim's father, appears to provide a lot of comfort for the North Korean leaders. Kim reportedly is known for traveling with a big entourage — possibly more than 200 people — and lots of supplies.His train, unmistakable with its dark green paint job and yellow piping, is perfect for that.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_6>Its 90 carriages are said to contain bedrooms, conference rooms and a chamber equipped with satellite phones and flat-screen televisions, as well as cases of Bordeaux and Beaujolais wine flown from Paris, Konstantin Pulikovsky, a Russian official who accompanied Kim Jong ll on a three-week trip to Moscow in 2001, said in an account published in 2002.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_7>Passengers could also reportedly feast on live lobster and pork barbecue.For security reasons, officials reportedly make sure to collect Kim's bodily waste and even his cigarette butts to prevent foreign intelligence agencies from collecting and analyzing them for clues into the leader's health.Seoul-based Chad O'Carroll, editor of the influential NK News, told Fox News on Sunday 38 North report on the train was \"significant,\" and there have been other sightings of him at the coastal resort.Kim could be recuperating in Wonsan from an operation. He has reportedly been sending messages to various officials, according to state media.O'Carroll told Fox News the regime wouldn't do that if it was getting ready to announce Kim's death. He also downplayed reports that Kim was in a “vegetative state,\" saying if any Chinese medical experts had any stature, they would not blow Beijing’s cover.“It was just too matter-of-fact,” O'Carroll told Fox News on Sunday.Other than the arrival of the train, Andrei Lankov, Seoul-based Director of the Korea Risk Group and former North Korea resident, told Fox News \"there have been no unusual movements of military, security, preparations, even jockeying for power in North Korea,\" leaving Lankov to believe \"Kim is definitely not dead.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_8>Kim is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea, and he hadn’t missed the April 15 event, one of the year's most important for the North, since assuming power after his father Kim Jong Il’s death in late 2011.Kim's health is of crucial importance because of worries that a serious illness or death could cause instability in the impoverished, nuclear-armed country.North Korea exerts extremely tight control over information about its leadership, making it virtually impossible for outsiders to find out what’s going on at senior levels. When Kim Jong Il died in December 2011, for instance, few outsiders knew it until it was reported by North Korea’s state media two days later.A senior U.S. official told Fox News on Saturday there is no definitive intelligence suggesting that Kim Jong Un is dead and that officials are watching the situation carefully.While he has ruled with an iron fist, the North Korean leader has had health issues. In 2014, he vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. South Korea’s spy agency said days later that he had a cyst removed from his ankle.Foreigners who were in proximity to Kim during the last Trump-Kim Summit in 2019 noted unusually heavy breathing for someone in his mid-30s.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_9>Kim also appeared winded while walking slowly, a likely sign of the underlying heart condition that’s plagued him for years, an intelligence source told Fox News at the time.Fox News' Tucker Carlson -- who witnessed President Trump become the first sitting U.S. president to enter North Korea and shake hands with Kim in the Demilitarized Zone last summer -- described Kim as “wheezing like an emphysema patient, not a healthy guy.”Seoul-based American and Yonsei University Professor John Delury told Fox News on Sunday that Kim's death was only a \"remote possibility... an operation is much more likely.\"Delury added it will take Pyongyang to come clean on all of this to settle the rumors in recent days.\"I don't see how we can go from rumors and speculation to fact and interpretation until the North Koreans themselves decide to share something about Kim's condition,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/kim-jong-un-north-korea-train-wonsan-health-rumor-speculation-satellite-image", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "This Tuesday, April 21, 2020, satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies and annotated by 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies, shows an overview of the Wonsan complex in Wonsan, North Korea.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/nksat_4.jpg"}, {"caption": "This Wednesday, April 15, 2020, satellite image provided by Airbus Defence &amp; Space and annotated by 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies, shows Leadership Railway Station in Wonsan, North Korea.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/nksat_2.jpg"}, {"caption": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's train has been parked at the Leadership Railway Station servicing his Wonsan compound since at least April 21, the website 38 North said Saturday.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/nksat_3.jpg"}, {"caption": "This Tuesday, April 21, 2020, satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies and annotated by 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies, shows the Leadership Railway Station in Wonsan, North Korea.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7234_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/nksat_5.jpg"}, {"caption": "This Wednesday, April 15, 2020, satellite image provided by Airbus Defence &amp; Space and annotated by 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies, shows an overview of the Wonsan complex in Wonsan, North Korea.

{"title": "Italian engineers help coronavirus patients by harnessing snorkel masks for CPAP machines", "body": ".After news spread that the Italian innovation firm Isinnova successfully saved lives by 3D printing ventilator valves for its local hospital, CEO Cristian Fracassi and engineer Alessandro Romaioli fielded all sorts of calls from around the world.Many 3D-printing companies wanted to join in and help. Several countries wanted to use similar technology for their populations. But, one call started a whole new project for Isinnova’s staff in Brescia, in northern Italy.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_0>Renato Favero, a retired physician, got in touch with Fracassi and Romaioli by contacting a doctor at the Chiari hospital where the ventilator valves were used.Dr. Favero explained that he was aware of the shortage of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure masks, also known as CPAP, for sub-intensive care patients suffering from COVID-19. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s website, CPAP “is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your breathing airways open” and “involves using a CPAP machine that includes a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth, straps to position the mask, a tube that connects the mask to the machine’s motor, and a motor that blows air into the tube.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_1>Speaking with Fox News, Romaioli said that Favero proposed an idea: making an “emergency ventilator mask” by modifying a snorkeling mask that was available to the public. The teams contacted Decathlon, the French sporting goods retailer, about the Easy Breath Surface Snorkeling Mask. Isinnova said that Decathlon immediately provided the 3D computer-aided design for the mask, so the engineers could easily evaluate what modification could be made.Unlike the full ventilators, that breathe both in and out for a patient, Romaioli explained that these CPAP machines regulate the pressure and level of oxygen that go into the lungs.From start to finish, the project took only three days, Romaioli said, after analyzing, measuring, 3D printing and testing various options. “We had to do it very quickly because it was a matter of saving lives. We didn’t do it as a usual project, where we would have had time to check it three, four times,” he said. “We just had to do it as quick as we could.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_2>The first test was on Romaioli himself. He put the mask on, so that they could determine if the alterations to the snorkel mask had worked.“I was healthy, so it wasn’t a real test, but before putting on a sick patient, they had to test it on someone else who wasn’t at risk,” Romaioli shared. After that initial test went well, they took the prototypes to the same Chiari hospital where they provided 100 3D-printed ventilator valves. Doctors tested the re-worked mask on multiple patients, to be sure that it could be useful.They printed about 50 of the pieces needed to alter the mask into a CPAP machine, but Isinnoa pointed out that many other 3D-printing companies joined the fight, and all told about 1,000 new machines were created.Isinnova has updated its website with a full page of information in English and Italian, including 3D designs and guidance on creating and using these snorkel masks turned breathing devices.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_3>The company has heard from volunteers and doctors in Canada, Brazil and South Korea about how this redesign has started to save lives.“The feedback has all been positive, not because it’s the biggest therapy in the world, but because they can apply some therapy to people that they haven’t been able to help before,” Romaioli said. “All hospitals are going to run out of breathing masks, biomedical or certified, but these homemade masks can treat some patients that they couldn’t before.”He added, “We feel proud, because as before, we feel that we did something good.”And as for the hard-hit town in northern Italy that has suffered so much under the coronavirus pandemic, Romaioli said, “We’re starting to hope.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//tech/italian-engineers-innovate-life-saving-design-again-using-snorkel-masks-for-covid-19-patients", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Alessandro Romiaoli wearing the modified snorkel mask.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/IMG-20200321-WA0007.jpg"}, {"caption": "Testing the CPAP mask.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_20200324_175531-e1585264221179.jpg"}, {"caption": "Isinnova CEO Cristian Fracassi holding the innovative CPAP mask.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_20200323_094900-e1585268672613.jpg"}, {"caption": "A 3D-printed piece for the modification of the mask.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7297_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_20200320_075943-e1585268935483.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Coronavirus wipes out Italian town's supply of ventilator valves, as local business jumps in", "body": ".As Italy now surpasses China in total deaths as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the European country’s health care system has been hit hard and is struggling to keep up with the flood of critical patients in its hospitals. The death toll in Italy exceeded 5,000 lives lost, as of Monday.Like many impacted countries, Italy lacks sufficient masks and gloves for their doctors and nurses, and most critically -- ventilators. Because the novel coronavirus is a respiratory illness that can wreak havoc a patient’s lungs, in some cases a patient can require a ventilator to breathe for them and keep them alive.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7301_News_0>One such hospital is in Chiari, in the province of Brescia in northern Italy. The surrounding region, Lombardy, is one of the epicenters of the virus.The hospital, located about an hour east of Milan, has been flooded with patients suffering from the coronavirus. When staff ran out of a crucial valve that connects to the ventilator, the hospital reached out to a local newspaper, to put out the call for help.Fox News spoke with Isinnova, the Brescia-based business, that stepped up and answered that call. CEO and founder Cristian Fracassi said his staff of 14 were all working from home, as instructed, when he was contacted about the hospital’s needs.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7301_News_1>Fracassi said Isinnova is a research center where staff often work on patents, innovative projects and prototypes but had only had one past client in the biomedical field before this week.Interviewed via video call, Fracassi and his mechanical engineer Alessandro Romaioli said they were connected with the Ospedale di Chiari as soon as they heard about the need for the special lifesaving valves. The hospital was in crisis, they explained, and the manufacturer of the much-needed Venturi valves was unable to get a fresh supply to the hospital. Because the coronavirus pandemic constituted an emergency, Fracassi said that the hospital was permitted to look for outside help to solve the problem.“The right piece is certified, so the hospital can be sure it doesn’t create any danger,” Romaoili explained, of the reason the hospital generally uses the same manufacturer during normal circumstances. But, because of massive supply chain delays, they had to be creative. “Because lives were in danger, the hospital can use [our 3D-printed version].”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7301_News_2>Isinnova said it contacted the manufacturer directly to ask for the plans in order to create a replica, but the request was denied.Fracassi and Romaioli, along with two other employees, went into their office located a little over 15 miles from the hospital, and started brainstorming. They quickly came up with a solution: 3D printing.The hospital was able to give them a single used and sanitized valve to measure and analyze. The venturi valves are not single-use, they explained, but can only be used on one patient -- not re-used on any other patients.The Isinnova team took measurements by hand, and after they created a working prototype of the valve, they rushed five samples over to the hospital to be tested on patients.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7301_News_3>Romaioli and Fracassi waited at the hospital while the doctors tested the valves.The valves worked.“We were unable to speak, because of emotion. Maybe we saved some lives? The doctor saved lives, we just helped the doctor,” Romaoili added.Fracassi and his colleagues completed 95 pieces in 24 hours. “We maybe slept a few hours. I don’t remember,” Romaoili laughed.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7301_News_4>They worked with three different types of 3D printers to get it right and were only slowed down by a small detail: a tiny hole down the center of the valve. “The 3D printer isn’t able to make such a small hole, so we did it by hand,” said Romaoili. “After the production, one by one, and then we washed them” before bringing the 95 ventilator valves to the hospital.For Fracassi, it was personal. “I didn’t speak to my mother for two days because we were working in a dangerous area, directly in the hospital.” Brescia had been particularly hard hit by the virus. A formerly bustling intersection showed just a few cars out the window of Isinnova’s office.When asked about the reports that the manufacturer of the original venturi valve had threatened to sue Fracassi or Isinnova, he laughed and called it “fake news”. Other than the initial call to ask for the 3D plans of the valve, Fracassi said he and his company have not had any further conversations with the multinational manufacturer, who he declined to name.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7301_News_5>Since helping the local hospital in Chiari, Isinnova continues to print valves, just in case. They’ve been contacted by various other hospitals and 3D-printing firms in several countries, but the process must begin at the start each time. Different ventilators require different valves, so 3D prototypes have to be made in each instance, since they may not be using the same venturi valves as Chiari.Asked why the small company jumped so quickly at the chance to problem-solve amidst the global pandemic, Fracassi said, “We love competition. It was a hard competition, we could try to help them, and we won.”Isinnova didn’t take any payment for the 3D-printed valves.

{"title": "5 interesting facts about the moon", "body": "The moon has been the Earth's companion in the Solar System for almost five billion years. It is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate.In addition, it has guided the way humans live for thousands of years.The moon is the fifth largest of the 190+ moons orbiting planets in the Solar System.Earth's only natural satellite is simply called \"the moon\" because people didn't know other moons existed until Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.Here are five interesting facts you should know about the Earth's moon.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7320_News_0>Although theories about the formation of the moon vary, the leading explanation remains that a \"Giant Impact\"  or \"Big Whack\" created the ingredients for the moon off the primitive molten Earth and into orbit.Scientists have suggested that the impactor was about 10 percent of the mass of Earth — just larger than Mars. A cloud of vaporized rock was kicked up after the event and went into orbit around the Earth. The cloud then cooled and condensed into a ring of small, solid bodies, which then gathered — forming the celestial object.According to Space.com, because the Earth and the moon are so similar, researchers have come to the conclusion that the collision must have happened around 95 million years after the formation of the Solar System, which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.Studies in 2015 that uncovered differences in the abundance of the element tungsten-182 detected in the Earth and the moon gave weight to this theory.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7320_News_1>\"Unambiguous evidence\" of traces of water have been found on the surface of the moon that may have originated from deep under its surface.Detailed in the journal Science, evidence of lunar polar water ice was recorded by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. While the moon remains drier than any desert on Earth, water is said to exist on the moon in very small quantities. One ton of the top layer of the moon's surface has the capacity to hold about 32 ounces of water, researchers said.When the Apollo astronauts returned from the moon, they brought back several samples of lunar rocks. The rocks were later analyzed for signs of water and, while trace amounts were detected, they were assumed to be contamination from Earth. The consensus then became that the rest of the moon was dry.However, later observations of the surface made with Chandrayaan-1, NASA's Cassini spacecraft, and NASA's Deep Impact probe called that assumption into question after detecting the spectral signal of either water or the hydroxyl group. The findings exhibited that not only is the moon hydrated, but the process that makes it so is a dynamic one driven by changes in solar radiation hitting any given spot on the surface.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7320_News_2>The moon's gravitational force pulls on the Earth's oceans. The pull causes two bulges of water on the Earth's oceans — one where the ocean waters face the moon and the pull is strongest and one where the ocean waters face away from the moon and the pull is weakest.As Earth rotates underneath, the bulges move around it -- one always facing the moon, the other directly opposite. This is created because gravity pulls Earth toward the moon more than it pulls at the water.The combined forces of gravity, the Earth's rotation, and other factors usually cause two high tides to two low tides every day.At the full moon and the new moon, the sun, Earth, and moon are aligned, producing higher than normal tides called \"spring tides.\" When the moon is at first or last quarter smaller tides form; when the moon is closest to the Earth in its orbital path, spring tides are even higher. Those tides are called Perigean spring tides.The pull of the moon means that some of the Earth's rotational energy is stolen, causing the planet to slow down by 1.5 milliseconds every century.Lastly, the moon is moving away from us. The energy the moon takes is used to propel itself about 3.8 centimeters higher in its orbit.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7320_News_3>Small moonquakes several miles below the surface are believed to be caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Tiny fractures may appear at the surface and gas escapes.Scientists report that the moon has a core that is hot and potentially partially molten much like the Earth's core. However, data from NASA's Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed in 1999 that the moon's core is tiny compared to that of the Earth, likely between two percent and four percent of its mass.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7320_News_4>The craters which pockmark the moon are formed by asteroid impacts millions of years ago. The craters have not eroded much over the years.The moon is not geologically very active, so earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain-building do not alter the landscape as they do on Earth. There are also no weather events, as the moon has virtually no atmosphere. There is no wind or rain, so very little surface erosion occurs on the moon.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//science/5-interesting-facts-about-the-moon", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7320_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "An artist's interpretation of the Big Bang.

{"title": "Thousands of migrants mass at Greek border, more flee Syria", "body": "The United Nations said Sunday that at least 13,000 people were massed on Turkey’s land border with Greece, after Turkey officially declared its western borders were open to migrants and refugees hoping to head into the European Union.Turkey's decision to open the borders with Greece came amid a military escalation in Syria's northwest that has led to growing direct clashes between Turkish and Syrian forces.In Syria, the government said it was closing its airspace for any flights or drones across the country's northwestern region. It said any aircraft that penetrates Syrian airspace will be treated as hostile and shot down.The announcement came after two days of Turkish drone attacks in Idlib province that Syrian activists said caused heavy losses to Syrian government forces. These confrontations have added to soaring tensions between Turkey and Russia, which support opposing sides of the Syrian civil war.\"Any jet that violates our airspace will be treated as a hostile target that must be shot down and prevented from achieving its goals,” the Syrian military statement said. It was not immediately clear whether the statement referred to friendly Russian jets in addition to Turkish aircraft.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_0>The statement came shortly after the Syrian army shot down a Turkish drone over the town of Saraqeb in Idlib, according to military-run media.Turkish Defense Minsiter Hulusi Akar, speaking from military headquarters near the Syrian border, said Turkey aimed to confront Syrian government forces rather than Russian troops. He called on Moscow to persuade Syrian President Bashar Assad to withdraw to 2018 cease-fire lines on the edges of Idlib.Referring to losses inflicted on Syria, he said Turkey had “neutralized” more than 2,200 Syrian troops, 103 tanks and eight helicopters.“The Spring Shield operation, which was launched following the abominable attack in Idlib on Feb. 27, continues successfully,\" Akar said, referring to air strikes that killed 33 Turkish soldiers.The operation is Turkey's fourth in the war-torn country since 2016.The heavy fighting in northwest Syria has also triggered a humanitarian catastrophe and the single largest wave of displacement in the nine-year Syrian civil war.Ankara is worried it might come under renewed international pressure to open its now sealed border with Syria and offer refuge to hundreds of thousands more Syrian civilians. Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's decision to open his country's borders with Europe made good on a longstanding threat to let refugees into the continent. His announcement marked a dramatic departure from the current policy and an apparent attempt to pressure Europe into offering Turkey more support in dealing with the fallout from the Syrian war to its south.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_1>The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration said Sunday that by the previous evening, its staff working along the Turkish-Greek land border “had observed at least 13,000 people gathered at the formal border crossing points at Pazarkule and Ipsala and multiple informal border crossings, in groups of between several dozen and more than 3,000.”Greek authorities fired tear gas and stun grenades through Saturday to prevent repeated attempts by a crowd of more than 4,000 people massed at the border crossing in Kastanies to cross, and fought a cat-and-mouse game with groups cutting holes in a border fence along the border to crawl through.Erdogan’s communications director Fahrettin Altun later said Turkey had changed its focus to preparing for the possibility of new arrivals from Syria “instead of preventing refugees who intend to migrate to Europe.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_2>“Europe and others must take robust action to address this monumental challenge,” Altun said. “We can’t be expected to do this on our own.”He accused critics of Turkey’s refugee policy of “rampant hypocrisy.”He claimed 80,888 had left Turkey for Europe “in the past several days” and called on Europe to share the burden of looking after refugees. But there was no evidence to support his claim. Greece has shut its border, and there were a few dozen arrests of people who managed to cross through the border, Greek authorities have said.Greek Deputy Defense Minister Alkiviadis Stefanis told the local broadcaster Skai there were around 9,600 attempts to illegally cross Greece’s border during the night Saturday to Sunday. Stefanis said all were successfully thwarted. Previously several dozen migrants had managed to make it through.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_3>Greek officials said they arrested 66 migrants Friday, 17 of whom were sentenced to 3.5 years in jail for entering the country illegally. All Afghans, they were the first migrants sentenced for illegal entry since 2014. On Saturday, Greece arrested another 70 people who tried to cross the land border illegally.Stavros Zamalides, president of the local community in Kastanies, said Turkish soldiers were actively helping people cross the Greek border clandestinely.“Turkish soldiers with cutters in their hands were cutting the wires of the fence to lead the illegal migrants” into crossing the border, he said. “The attempt was thwarted by the intervention of our own patrol that happened to be passing that area on patrol at the time, and it repaired the damage in the fence,” he added.Twenty-year-old Afghan Ayamuddin Azimi made it to the Greek border village of Nea Vyssa along with a compatriot. He said Turkey had opened its borders “to save the refugees” but when they got to the frontier they found the Greek side closed.He crossed clandestinely, he said. “What can I do? We have nothing to do. This is our life.”Others were making the short but often perilous sea crossing from the Turkish coast to the Greek islands.Initial figures collected by Greece's Merchant Marine Ministry from the coast guard around the eastern Aegean islands showed a clear increase in the number of people arriving by dinghies from the nearby Turkish coast.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_4>By midday Sunday, the ministry said initial figures indicated 390 people had arrived since Sunday morning in several boats. The vast majority arrived on the island of Lesbos, with smaller numbers on Chios and Samos. More were believed to be attempting to reach the islands.In parallel, the heavy fighting in northwest Syria has pushed nearly 950,000 displaced Syrian civilians to flee toward the border with Turkey.Turkey is a strong backer of the rebels in Syria’s Idlib province. But the presence of thousands of Turkish troops there has done little to stop Assad's relentless campaign to seize the last rebel-held territories.Dozens of Turkish soldiers have been killed by the Russian-backed Syrian government forces around Idlib in recent days.Erdogan has warned of an “imminent” operation against Assad's forces unless they pull back from Turkish lines in Syria by the end of February.As that deadline passed Saturday night, Turkish drones bombed Syrian government targets in Idlib, and Turkey-backed rebels shelled Syrian army positions. Fighting raged near the strategic town of Saraqeb as government troops sought to take it back from rebels, opposition activists and Syrian state-media said. The town, which lies on the Damascus-Aleppo highway, had changed hands several times in the last month.Turkey has lost 55 soldiers in Idlib in February, including 33 killed in an airstrike on Thursday, and now feels the need to respond strongly. Talks between Turkey and Russia, the main power brokers in Syria, have so far failed to defuse tensions.On Saturday, Erdogan said Turkey would no longer stand in the way of refugees and migrants already in the country who hope to head to Europe.“We will not close the gates to refugees,” he said. “The European Union has to keep its promises. We are not obliged to look after and feed so many refugees.\"Under a 6 billion euro deal in 2016, Turkey agreed to stem the tide of refugees to Europe in return for financial aid after more than a million people entered Europe in 2015. It has since accused the EU of failing to honor the agreement. Erdogan has frequently threatened to “open the gates” and allow refugees and migrants to head to Europe unless more international support was provided.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/thousands-of-migrants-mass-at-greek-border-more-flee-syria", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Migrants arrive at the village of Skala Sikaminias, on the Greek island of Lesbos, after crossing on a dinghy the Aegean sea from Turkey, Sunday, March 1, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/migrant_3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Migrants arrive at the village of Skala Sikaminias, on the Greek island of Lesbos, after crossing on a dinghy the Aegean sea from Turkey, Sunday, March 1, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/migrant_5.jpg"}, {"caption": "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country's borders with Europe were open Saturday, making good on a longstanding threat to let refugees into the continent as thousands of migrants gathered at the frontier with Greece.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/migrant_6.jpg"}, {"caption": "Migrants arrive at the village of Skala Sikaminias, on the Greek island of Lesbos, after crossing on a dinghy the Aegean sea from Turkey, Sunday, March 1, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/migrant_4.jpg"}, {"caption": "Migrants try to warm themselves around bonfire at the village of Skala Sikaminias, on the Greek island of Lesbos, after crossing on a dinghy the Aegean sea from Turkey, Sunday, March 1, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7382_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/migrant_2.jpg"}]}

The Met Office, Britain's meteorological service, said more heavy rain is forecast over the next 48 hours, bringing the threat of \"significant flooding\" in the coming days.Storm Dennis — the second major storm of the winter — blew through the U.K. over the weekend, bringing wind gusts of up to 90 mph and heavy rain that flooded roads, railways, homes, and businesses. Three people were killed in the U.K., including a 55-year-old woman swept away in floodwaters.Johnson has faced criticism in wake of the recent flooding for the decision not to visit devastated communities or to convene a meeting of the government’s crisis committee, COBRA.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7399_News_0>During severe flooding in November, Johnson visited flood-impacted areas and held COBRA meetings in the midst of the country's general election campaign, according to Sky News.Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi said Thursday that Johnson has been \"leading the team\" by being focused on making sure that funding gets to residents and businesses impacted by the floods instead of worrying about a \"media photo opp.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7399_News_1>When asked during a Sky News interview about why Johnson made visits during the election campaign but not after the latest round of floods, Zahawi once again defended the prime minister's decision.\"Quite rightly, rather than having a sort of jamboree of media and your whole entourage going, he wants to help people by getting the funding to them,” Zahawi said.Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has been adding fuel to the criticism of Johnson.

Two snow removal operations took place in the area in the hour before the incident, but strong winds blew snow back into the roadway from the nearby river.“People were driving, there were strong winds ... and, suddenly, you couldn't see anything,'' Bonnardel told reporters. \"And then, well, the pileup started.\"A group of American tourists from New York who were at the front of the pileup told Canada's CTV News they pulled onto the highway and faced a \"pure white snow like a whiteout\" before pulling to the shoulder as the crashes began.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7400_News_0>Spencer Jacob told CTV an ambulance responding to an initial crash was hit by an ambulance at \"full speed\" before a chain-reaction crash was underway.\"Another car came down and just flew into the back of the ambulance.

{"title": "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 pilot suspected by 'top levels' of mass murder-suicide, ex-Aussie PM says", "body": "The \"top levels\" of the Malaysian government have long suspected that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 nearly six years ago was an act of mass murder-suicide by the pilot, Australia's former prime minister said in an explosive interview that aired Wednesday.The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing vanished March 8, 2014, and is presumed to have crashed in the far southern Indian Ocean. A safety report into the disaster by an international team in July 2018 revealed the plane was likely steered off course deliberately by someone and flown for several hours after communications were severed.Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was in office when the flight vanished, told Sky News Australia that high-ranking Malaysian officials believed veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately downed the jet.“My very clear understanding, from the very top levels of the Malaysian government, is that from very, very early on they thought it was murder-suicide by the pilot,” Abbott told Sky News.Abbott, who was Australia's prime minister from 2013-15, made the comments in the first part of a Sky News Australia documentary \"MH370: The Untold Story\" that is airing Wednesday and Thursday.“I'm not going to say who said what to whom, but let me reiterate, I want to be absolutely crystal clear, it was understood at the highest levels that this was almost certainly murder-suicide by the pilot, mass-murder-suicide by the pilot,\" Abbott said in the interview that aired Wednesday.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News_0>In the July 2019 issue of The Atlantic, writer and aviation specialist William Langewiesche delved into what happened to the missing aircraft, including a look at Shah, who had \"indications of trouble.\" The night the aircraft went missing, control was seized in the cockpit during a 20-minute period between 1:01 a.m. and 1:21 a.m. and radar records show the autopilot was probably switched off, according to Langewiesche.When the report by a 19-member international team was released in July 2019, chief investigator Kok Soo Chon said during a media briefing there was no evidence of abnormal behavior or stress among the two pilots – Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid – that could lead them to hijack the plane.The report, however, did say the plane's course was changed manually but did not name a suspect and raised the possibility of “intervention by a third party.” Investigators stressed the cause of the disappearance still couldn't be determined until the wreckage and the plane's black boxes are found.Langewiesche noted that while the co-pilot had nothing but a bright future ahead and no red flags in his past, Zaharie's life raised multiple concerns. After his wife moved out, the captain, who was reported to be \"lonely and sad,\" also \"spent a lot of time pacing empty rooms\" and obsessed over two young internet models. The pilot's family, however, has long denied he was suicidal.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News_1>Forensic examinations of the pilot's simulator by the FBI also revealed he experimented with a flight profile that roughly matched what's believed to have happened to MH370, and that ended in \"fuel exhaustion over the Indian Ocean.\" New York Magazine reported in 2016 that the simulated flight was conducted less than a month before the plane vanished.In his interview with Sky News, Abbott said he did not believe conspiracy theories centered on the Malaysian government, which owns Malaysia Airlines.“I’ve read all these stories that the Malaysians allegedly didn’t want the murder-suicide theory pursued because they were embarrassed about one of their pilots doing this. I have no reason to accept that,” he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News_2>Scattered pieces of debris that washed ashore on African beaches and Indian Ocean islands indicate MH370 crashed in a distant stretch of the ocean, but a multi-government search by Australia, Malaysia and China has failed to pinpoint a location.Abbott believes a new investigation is now warranted.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News_3>“Let's assume that it was murder-suicide by the pilot and if there is any part of that ocean that could have been reached on that basis that has not yet been explored, let's get out and explore it,” he said.Earlier this month, Malaysia said it has yet to decide on launching a new search due to not having received any new credible evidence to initiate one.“However, the ministry will review any new evidence that it officially receives,” the Malaysian Ministry of Transport said in a brief statement to Reuters.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News_4>The comments came after Australia’s News Corp reported that a new search could be mounted, possibly this year, based on new evidence that it said showed the plane could have ended up in an area adjacent to the previous search area in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which previously conducted a three-month search, was reportedly in discussions with the Malaysian government to launch a new search on a no-find, no-fee basis.Ocean Infinity chief executive officer Oliver Plunkett said “no new search is imminent,” but the firm continues to engage with experts to identify where any new search might be launched.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News_5>“The Malaysian government, rightly in our view, set a high bar before they will engage in that discussion,” Plunkett told Reuters.The Ministry of Transport has not yet commented about the remarks from the former Australian leader, according to The Associated Press.Malaysian police chief Abdul Hamid Bador, who was one of the investigators, told local media that there was no evidence of Zaharie's involvement and that the plane's disappearance was still a mystery. Former Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in a statement to the AP that investigators had “explored every single lead and possibility\" but found no conclusive answer to why the plane vanished.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-pilot-suspected-mass-suicide-government-australiam-pm-plane", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "MH370 Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was often \"lonely and sad,\" and had experimented with a flight profile similar to that of the missing plane, according to a report last year.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7406_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/asia-shah.jpg"}, {"caption": "This map shows the intended route of MH370 and the area that plane debris was found in September 2018.

{"title": "Climate change or poor policy? As Australia’s wildfires see some relief, blame game ascends", "body": "The sky finally cracked open atop much of the fire grounds in NSW, Australia this week – the welcome deluge slashing the number of burning fires to below 100 for the first time in more than a month.But the challenge is far from over as the finger-pointing game ignites.Much of the international attention – from Hollywood to political leaders alike – have focused on the fires as being the perils of climate change, and the nation’s ineffective policies in combating the globally pressing issue.Russell Crowe has avowed that “the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based\" and Cate Blanchett stressed that “when one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster, so we’re in it together.\" Meanwhile, scores of others, from Metallica and Pink to Elton John and Chris Hemsworth, have dug deep into their pockets and donated to those endeavoring to combat the infernos.Yet authorities say it was a perfect storm of disturbing factors.“There are many reasons for the fires starting,” Paul Baxter, Commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW and President and Board Chair of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council (AFAC), told Fox News. “Some have been natural – lightning – and some have been caused by human, both maliciousness and carelessness.”Baxter also pointed to Australia’s habitat as being ripe for such a disaster.“The widespread nature of bushland in Australia, the readiness of plant materials to ignite and propagate fire spread so easily and the fact that fire is a very well-known and historical factor of the Australian landscape, being a necessary factor of forest health and growth,” he said.NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) has stated that the largest conflagrations were enkindled by dry lightning, essentially lightning storms without rain. And some victims and analysts have bemoaned calls to address climate changes as secondary to fixing what they consider to be a broken system.“Climate change has brought bountiful rains throughout most of the past two decades, which have suppressed wildfires and allowed for more vegetation growth. That is a good thing,” said James Taylor, Director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute. “However, Australian government policies that discourage or prohibit prescribed burns and other proactive land management have meant that when we finally have a dry year, there is more fuel for the fires, less management of the vegetation that fuels the fires, and a greater chance of wildfires burning out of control.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7517_News_0>Baxter asserted that it was clear to him that “climate has an impact on the current situation.”“Regardless of the reasons for climate change, we all know from the facts that the climate is changing,” he said. “We have longer, hotter, and drier fire seasons. The winters are shorter, meaning that the hazard reduction or 'prescribed burning’ is much shorter, and we have less days to get the required burning done.”Prescribed or hazard reduction burning refers to deliberate, monitored fires conducted during off-seasons, aimed at clearing out flammable materials from precarious terrain. It is regulated and administered by agencies at a state level, such as park authorities or environmental bodies. Eucalyptus trees, an Australian bushland staple, are also known to be especially flammable.The likes of Collen Jackson, a 46-year-old farmer in the town of Benembra, see “environmentalists” as problematic catalysts in obstructing hazard reduction.“The traditional owners of this land have used circle burn techniques for thousands of years to control the build-up of hazardous material – leaf matter, bark, fallen dead wood, low bushy trees. These circle burns allowed animals to escape the fire and, at the same time, cleaned up the forest floor to remove fuel for a wildfire,” she said. “This type of burning has been refused by the government due to environmentalist pressure.”From Jackson’s lens, this has allowed “almost 30 years of fuel buildup on the forest floor” and thus “has made these fires uncontrollable by increasing the heat of the fires one thousandfold.”“It’s like any fire, the less wood you add to it, the less it burns. Lightning strikes would still have ignited a fire due to dryness, but if there was no fuel on the forest floor, then the fires would not have been so ferocious,” she continued.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7517_News_1>Others lamented hefty fines for creating unauthorized firebreaks or conducting hazard reduction without going through the permit process.“All considered, climate change is suppressing Australian wildfires, but poor government policies, ironically supported by climate and environmental activists, are making the present wildfires worse,” Taylor conjectured.Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce claimed on national television this year that “green caveats” hindered his team reduction burns, in essence leading to the fire crisis.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7517_News_2>However, the Australian Greens party has subsequently come out to refute such claims, stressing in a statement that they “support hazard reduction burns and back burning when guided by the best scientific, ecological and emergency service expertise.”“The Coalition has spent six years in office ignoring the main cause of these unprecedented bushfires – severe climate change,” said the statement. “The major cause of climate change that has led to these bushfires and extremely dry conditions around the country is the mining, burning and exporting of coal, oil, and gas.”Australia is the world’s fourth-largest producer of coal, which remains its most valuable export.“Coal is the single biggest driver of climate change, contributing to nearly half of carbon emissions worldwide. Australia is currently the world’s largest coal exporter, which is troubling, particularly as we see governments across the world phasing out coal and financial institutions also starting to back away from financing coal,” said Julie Anne Miranda-Brobeck, communications manager for Global Witness, an NGO that endeavors to exposes natural resource corruption and human rights abuses worldwide. “Coal is simply not economically viable.”Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged to “address issues around hazard reduction for national parks, dealing with land clearing laws, zoning laws and planning laws around people’s properties and where they can be built.”He has also underscored that there were “many contributing factors” to the mammoth blazes, including the ongoing drought and fuel loads. The federal government has requested that the parliament’s environment and energy committee initiate an investigation pertaining to land and vegetation management.Morrison has furthermore denied accusations that he has failed to acknowledge climate change during his tenure in office. But he also has remained steadfast in protecting the coal industry and the hundreds of thousands of families who rely on it to make ends meet.For five months, Australia has been swathed in apocalyptic scenes of seemingly eternal fires ravishing its heartland, its animals, home, and lives. So far, the blazes have killed 28 people, destroyed 2,600 homes and scorched an area of more than 25.5 million acres, roughly the size of South Korea. The cost of the damage is expected to exceed $3 billion.Arson, too, has played its part.Police in New South Wales this week announced that, since the beginning of November, two dozen people have been charged with intentionally lighting fires, while 53 others have been accused of failing to comply with total fire ban regulations. A further 47 people have had legal action taken against them for dumping a burning cigarette or match on arid land.In Queensland, law enforcement has apprehended some 101 people for igniting blazes – 69 teenagers and 32 adults – and in Victoria, some 43 have reportedly been charged.Scientists insist that climate change has acerbated already ripe conditions for calamitous fires, while critics have contended that such devastation is nothing new to the Australian landscape.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7517_News_3>In 2009, the infamously-named Black Fires took the lives of 173 people, and more than 2000 homes were destroyed. In 1974, some 290 million acres of land were decimated by flames across Australia’s interior. The fire season of 1966 brought with it 62 lives lost at 7000 rendered homeless as over 4000 buildings burned, and dating back to the 1800’s documentation from a single fire season highlights that 640,000 acres burned, 12 people died, and thousands of dwellings charred to the ground.“This is not Australia’s hottest year. Nor is it Australia’s driest year.  Bushfires are a common occurrence there, going back a long time,” argued Steve Milloy, publisher of JunkScience.com. “The 1939 bushfires, for example, were much worse.  The most important reason for the bushfires is poor land management practices.  We know that because the Aborigines have cut their fires by 50 percent because of controlled burns, as even the New York Times has reported.”But for those most impacted by the combustion – some described shooting their animals, their faces awash with tears – skepticism remains that it will never really be over.“The fires are still burning and will be for months. I am sitting right in the middle of the impact zone. I know my farm will be burned, I just don’t know when,” Jackson said. “The government won’t be here, and they told us that three weeks ago – we are on our own. Yet if they had spent a small amount and control-burned their land, which borders mine, the fire would not have fuel to rush at me so fast. Unfortunately, our government is controlled by the majority of voters in the city who know nothing of country life.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/australia-wildfire-climate-change-poor-policy-blame-game", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7517_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Kylie Jenner posted this photo to her Instagram story in order to draw awareness to the Australian wildfires.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7517_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/kylie-australia-insta-story.jpg"}, {"caption": "A firefighter manages a controlled burn to help contain a larger fire near Falls Creek, Australia, Sunday, Jan. 5, 2020.

{"title": "Philippines Taal volcano generates lightning: Here's what causes those stunning displays", "body": "A volcanic eruption in the Philippines that's caused tens of thousands of people to evacuate is also creating a stunning display in the sky.The Taal Volcano, located about 37 miles south of Manila, began erupting Sunday, forcing the shutdown of the country's main airport until ashfall eased by Monday. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said in an advisory that 144 volcanic earthquakes have been reported since the initial eruption, with 44 quakes strong enough to be felt in nearby communities.\"Such intense seismic activity probably signifies continuous magma intrusion beneath the Taal edifice, which may lead to further eruptive activity,\" the institute's advisory read.The volcanology institute also said that steam-laden plumes over a mile tall were still being generated by the erupting volcano, bringing heavy ashfall. Images and videos from the scene showed a massive column of smoke and ash rising into the sky.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_0>As night fell around 6 p.m. on Sunday, an impressive display of rare volcanic lightning was also seen. So what is volcanic lighting?When sparks fly during a volcanic eruption, it has everything to do with physics above as opposed to the tectonic activity down below.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_1>Lightning, one the oldest observed natural phenomenon on earth, is a giant spark of electricity in the atmosphere between clouds, the air or the ground. According to the National Severe Storms Laboratory, lightning can occur between opposite charges within a thunderstorm cloud or between opposite charges a the cloud and on the ground.In order to get lightning during a volcanic eruption, there needs to be a thick plume of volcanic ash that allows a large charge separation between two masses.\"If the charge separation becomes big enough it is then able to overpower the air resistance, create a path of ionized air, and conduct electricity in the form of lightning,\" according to geologists at Oregon State University. \"The ash that is to be erupted begins as electrostatically neutral rock or rock fragments.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_2>Heat and movement within a volcano is the first source of particle charging, but ash particles usually acquire a charge by friction from the violent movements of being blasted out during a volcanic eruption.\"Think of skidding your socked feet rapidly across the carpet or rubbing a balloon quickly against your head. The same type of charge is accumulating within the ash cloud, only on a much larger scale,\" researchers at Oregon State note.Volcanos that typically lack a thick volcanic plume, like those in Hawaii that have more lava than ash, rarely have volcanic lightning, according to National Geographic.When a volcanic eruption is underway, location is directly related to where any lightning bolts may be spotted.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_3>According to the United States Geological Survey, lightning discharges are commonly associated with the formation of ash plumes during a volcanic eruption, particularly those that are \"explosive.\"As the ash plume rises into the sky, there are three regions of the plume where lighting discharges are likely to take place. Those areas include immediately above the vent of the volcano, in the column of ash that may extend several miles into the sky, and in the downwind plume of ash from the eruption as the column spreads out sideways.\"Lightning is the primary cause of unscheduled interruptions for most overhead power transmission lines and is a major cause of faults on typical overhead distribution lines,\" according to the USGS. \"Increased lightning discharge activity during volcanic eruptions, therefore, poses a heightened lightning hazard to power generation sites, substations, and transmission and distribution lines.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/philippines-volcano-lightning-display-geology-weather-ash-plume-charge", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Taal volcano spews ash in a view from Batangas, southern Philippines on Monday, Jan. 13, 2020.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/philipinesvolcano_4.jpg"}, {"caption": "Lightning flashes as Taal Volcano erupts Sunday Jan. 12, 2020, in Tagaytay, Cavite province, outside Manila, Philippines.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/volcanolightning_3.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this Sunday, Jan. 12, 2020, photo, lightning strikes beside the ash cloud as Taal Volcano erupts in Tagaytay, Cavite province, outside Manila, Philippines.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/volcanolightning_2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Lightning flashes as Taal Volcano erupts Sunday Jan. 12, 2020, in Tagaytay, Cavite province, outside Manila, Philippines.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7533_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/volcanolightning_1.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Australia wildfires may merge into 'mega blaze' as death toll climbs, government vows 'whatever it takes'", "body": "Australian communities besieged by raging wildfires were able to receive supplies on Monday after a change in the weather, as officials warn that conditions will deteriorate later this week, allowing some wildfires to merge into a \"mega blaze.\"Thousands of firefighters continue to battle the blazes that have burned millions of acres in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, an area twice the size of Maryland. Nationwide, at least 25 people have been killed and 2,000 homes destroyed by the blazes, while hundreds of millions of animals are believed to have perished.In the state of Victoria, authorities are concerned that three fires burning near the border with New South Wales may merge into a \"mega blaze\" when the heat returns to the region.\"These blazes certainly are concerning,\" Emergency Management Victoria's David Bruce told reporters Monday. \"Like NSW, we've had a bit of a reprieve, but the fires are still very active so we'll be doing everything we can to consolidate ahead of Thursday.\"The blazes that are drawing the concern of authorities involve one near Corryong in Victoria and two in Kosciuszko National Park and are about 6 miles apart, Australia's 7News reported.Rain and cooler temperatures on Monday may have brought relief to communities, but made it challenging for fire crews to complete strategic burns as they tried to prepare for higher temperatures<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7577_News_0>\"With the more benign weather conditions, it presents some wonderful relief for everybody: the firefighters, the emergency services personnel, but also the communities affected by these fires,\" Shane Fitzsimmons, commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told reporters. “But it also presents some real challenges when it comes to implementing tactical and strategic back-burns and other techniques to try and bring these fires under control.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7577_News_1>More than 135 fires were still burning across New South Wales, including almost 70 that were not contained. Officials have warned that the rain on Monday won't put out the largest and most dangerous blazes before conditions deteriorate again.On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the government was committing an extra 2 billion Australian dollars ($1.4 billion) toward the recovery effort in addition to the tens of millions of dollars that have already been promised.“The fires are still burning. And they’ll be burning for months to come,” Morrison said. \"And so that’s why I outlined today that this is an initial, an additional, investment of $2 billion. If more is needed and the cost is higher, then more will be provided.”Australia’s capital, Canberra, had the worst air quality of any major city in the world for much of Monday. The Department of Home Affairs, which is responsible for coordinating the country’s response to disasters, told all noncritical staff to stay home because of thick smoke choking the city.The National Gallery of Australia said it was closed on Monday to protect visitors and artworks from Matisse and Picasso due to the smoke, Reuters reported.Heavy smoke was hampering the navy’s efforts to airlift people out of Mallacoota, a coastal town in Victoria cut off for days by fires that forced as many as 4,000 residents and tourists to shelter on beaches over the weekend. Around 300 people were still waiting to be evacuated on Monday.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7577_News_2>On Kangaroo Island, a refuge off the coast of South Australia state for some of the country's most endangered creatures, teams had arrived to help euthanize livestock and wild animals injured in the blazes.In addition to the scores of wild animals that have been killed, Morrison said nearly 4,000 cattle and sheep are among the dead in the fires.Officials warned that Australia's wildfire season — which generally lasts through March — was nowhere near its end. Wildfires are common during the southern hemisphere summer, but this year’s fires arrived unusually early, fed by drought and the country’s hottest and driest year on record.Morrison has faced mounting critism over what many Australians have viewed as his lax response to the crisis. On Saturday, he announced he would dispatch 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists to help battle the fires and committed 20 million Australian dollars ($14 million) to lease firefighting aircraft from overseas.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7577_News_3>But others, such as the environmental group Greenpeace, said the relief funds announced by Morrison were “a drop in the ocean,” given the widespread devastation from the fires. Many have also urged the government to act on climate change.“Every single cent of that money should be contributed by the coal, gas and oil companies whose carbon pollution has caused the climate crisis that has created these extreme fire conditions, right across the country,” Greenpeace Australia Pacific Head of Campaigns Jamie Hanson said in a statement. “Slugging everyday taxpayers with the bill for this just adds insult to injury.

{"title": "Australia wildfires developing their own 'dangerous' weather systems, New Zealand skies turn orange", "body": "The wildfires that are ravaging parts of Australia are burning through vegetation under such extreme conditions the blazes are generating enough heat to create their own weather systems, including fire-generated thunderstorms and fire tornadoes.Thousands of firefighters continue to fight the blazes that have burned millions of acres in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, an area twice the size of Maryland. In New South Wales, the rural fire service (RFS) said as of Sunday there were 150 fires active in the state, 64 of them uncontrolled.\"It's not something we have experienced before,\" New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.On Saturday, the RFS warned that several fires along the coast had spawned fire-generated thunderstorms. One such storm was reported around 178 miles south of Syndey.\"A fire-generated thunderstorm has formed over the Mines, Pilot Lookout and Nine Mile fires, southwest of Thredbo and Ingebirah and west of Corrowong and Delegate. This is a very dangerous situation,\" the agency said on Twitter. \"Monitor the conditions around you and take appropriate action.\"The weather conditions that were reported Saturday in Australia are what is known as a pyrocumulonimbus clouds. According to the National Weather Service, a pyrocumulus cloud forms if there is enough moisture and atmospheric instability over the \"intense heat source.\"\"Although not common, these clouds can grow large enough to produce lightning and possibly some light precipitation,\" the NWS notes.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7582_News_0>The explosive storms can form during a fire when heat and moisture from the plants are released, even when the fuel is relatively dry. Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at the University of Alberta in Canada, told the Associated Press that warm air is less dense than cold air so it rises, releasing the moisture and forming a cloud that lifts and ends up a thunderstorm started by fire.“These can be deadly, dangerous, erratic and unpredictable,” Flannigan told the AP.The storms can inject particles as high as 10 miles into the air and generate dry lightning. The rising air also can cause intense updrafts that suck in air at a rate to cause strong winds to develop.Sometimes those winds can create what's known as a \"fire tornado,\" when winds created by an intense fire whirl and twist tightly. The hotter the fire, the faster the air rises and the tighter it twists until it takes off as a tornado. A fire tornado with the power of an EF-3 tornado was reported in the Carr Fire in California in 2018.Last week, an RFS firefighter was killed when a fire tornado caused by a pyrocumulonimbus cloud formation collapsing caused his fire truck to roll over, according to Reuters.“That extraordinary event resulted in cyclonic-type base flipping over a 10-ton truck. That is the volatility and danger that exists,” NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters last week on how dangerous fire-induced weather patterns can be.On Saturday Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that, for the first time in Australian history, 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists will be thrown into the battle against the fires. He also committed $14 million to leasing fire-fighting aircraft from overseas.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7582_News_1>Morrison has faced widespread criticism for taking a family vacation in Hawaii at the start of the wildfire crisis and was heckled last week when he visited a township in New South Wales in which houses had been destroyed and which was home to one of three volunteer firefighters who have died in the crisis so far.Morrison told a news conference Sunday it was not the time for blame.\"There has been a lot of blame being thrown around,\" Morrison said. \"And now is the time to focus on the response that is being made. ... Blame doesn't help anybody at this time and over-analysis of these things is not a productive exercise.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7582_News_2>Morrison, who has been chided for past remarks that appear to minimize the link between climate change and Australia's escalating threats of drought and wildfires, sought to \"correct the record\" on Sunday.\"I have seen a number of people suggest that somehow the government does not make this connection,\" he told reporters. The government has always made this connection and that has never been in dispute.”Australia's capital, Canberra, was enveloped in a smoky haze Sunday and air quality at midday was measured at 10 times the usual hazardous limit. The fires have killed at least 24 people in Australia and destroyed almost 2,000 homes.The early and devastating start to Australia’s summer wildfires has also been catastrophic for the country's wildlife, likely killing nearly 500 million birds, reptiles and mammals in New South Wales alone, Sydney University ecologist Chris Dickman told the Sydney Morning Herald. Frogs, bats and insects are excluded from his estimate, making the toll on animals much greater.The smoke is also having impacts over 1,200 miles away from the flames.In New Zealand the skies above Auckland on Sunday were tinged orange by smoke from the bushfires and police were inundated with calls from anxious residents.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7582_News_3>The spectacle caused such a commotion that authorities asked people to stop calling the emergency number to report the issue, Sky News reported.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7582_News_4>\"We're in Auckland, New Zealand.

Similar scenes were reported in the neighboring New South Wales state.\"We've got literally hundreds, thousands of people up and down the coast, taking refuge on the beaches,\" said Shane Fitzsimmons, the commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there were plans to evacuate the trapped people by sea. There also were grave fears for four people missing. \"We can't confirm their whereabouts,\" he said Tuesday.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7606_News_0>Andrews has requested assistance from 70 firefighters from the United States and Canada. Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp also confirmed “significant” property losses across the region due to the flames.Vacationers in Mallacoota said they were forced to shelter on beaches or on boats offshore as conditions grew more severe.\"At times it was ferocious, it was like hearing Armageddon, freight trains racing across paddocks. At other times it was eerily quiet,\" a woman named Mary, who was staying in the town for a few weeks, told Australia's 9News. \"We all thought we were prepared for bushfires but I don't think any of us were prepared for the severity of what we witnessed.\"People on the beach reported hearing gas canisters exploding as homes burned in the distance.The blaze has so far been able to be kept back from the shore after a change of wind, but Victoria's state emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters that many trapped on the beach could be forced the spend the night there, the BBC reported.Fire conditions worsened in Victoria and New South Wales after oppressive heat Monday mixed with strong winds and lightning.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7606_News_1>Fire officials showed how serious conditions were in a post on Twitter, where a fire crew was overrun by a bushfire near the town of Nowra.\"The crew was forced to shelter in their truck as the fire front passed through,\" officials said.Police in New South Wales said Tuesday that two men, believed to be father and son, died in a house in the wildfire-ravaged southeast town of Cobargo, while there are fears for another man missing.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7606_News_2>\"They were obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning,\" New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said. “The other person that we are trying to get to, we think that person was trying to defend their property in the early hours of the morning.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7606_News_3>On Monday, a firefighter was killed when extreme winds flipped his truck.

{"title": "2019 in review: The top 5 craziest weather moments", "body": "From whirling winds to literal walls of ice, there were some pretty wild weather moments in 2019.The year started out on a frigid note with the record-breaking cold thanks to the polar vortex before areas from the Southern Plains to the Northeast saw the most \"prolonged stretch\" of tornado and severe weather in eight years.Later in the year, the fourth consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane season would see 18 named storms, including six hurricanes of which three became \"major\" hurricanes of Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. But some of the wildest weather moments were not even from high-profile storms and happened in places such as upstate New York and in a major city in Mexico.Here are the wildest weather moments of 2019:<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7614_News_0>High winds that caused travel across the eastern half of the country with power outages and travel delays in February created another problem: a literal wall of ice.The windstorm created an \"ice tsunami\" on Feb. 24 across parts of New York along Lake Erie, pushing large chunks of ice along lakeshore areas. The Niagara Parks Police Service posted video to Twitter showing the chunks of ice stacked up along the Niagara River Parkway along the lake, forcing the roadway to be closed in some sections.High winds had raised water levels on the eastern end of Lake Erie in a phenomenon known as a seiche and then, according to the New York Power Authority, driven ice over a boom upstream from the river. Ice mounds between 25 and 30 feet high could be seen in photos approaching people's homes.The ice tsunami along the Hoover Beach area of Hamburg, New York spurred a voluntary evacuation for residents there.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7614_News_1>\"Residents in Hoover Beach can expect the Woodlawn FD to come door to door accounting for residents,\" town officials said in a Facebook post.The wind was to blame for another strange moment over the summer when a man in Colorado captured dozens of air mattresses set up for a movie night blown by strong winds across a park outside Denver.Robb Manes said he was at the Runway 35 park in Denver's Stapleton neighborhood on Aug. 17 when he noticed something that looked rather unusual.\"We were hanging out at the pool when, suddenly, a mattress flew into the fenced-in area,\" Manes wrote on YouTube. \"When a second and third one came in, we stood up, I grabbed my camera, and this is what we saw.\"The video shows dozens of air mattresses tumbling across a grassy park, flying near a pool as ominous-looking storm clouds appear. Several people can be seen trying to run after the mattresses, with some ducking for cover.\"So majestic,\" he wrote.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7614_News_2>A lightning strike was blamed for an explosive surprise in Florida when it triggered a blast that destroyed a toilet.Marylou Ward and her husband were sitting in their Port Charlotte home as a thunderstorm rolled through on Aug. 4 when she said she heard a \"boom\" that was \"the loudest noise I ever heard.\"When she stepped into her bathroom, she discovered the toilet was now in hundreds of pieces. A plumber from A-1 Affordable Plumbing Inc. told the couple the lightning strike ignited methane gas that built up in the pipes and septic tanks. Methane is typically emitted during the breakdown of sewage in waste systems.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7614_News_3>\"The toilet exploded in homeowners master bathroom sending porcelain airborne like a missile (the porcelain penetrated into wall). Most likely all sewer piping will need to be replaced and septic tank,\" a plumber posted to Facebook. \"Luckily no one was hurt! Scheduling a camera inspection this week to see how much sanitary pipe needs to be replaced!!\"In 2018, the Sunshine State had the highest density of lightning strikes, according to environmental measurement specialist Vaisala, which released its Annual Lightning Report. Florida had the highest average of negative ground-to-cloud flasher per square mile, with 24, according to the study.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7614_News_4>Another electrifying moment in 2019 happened in the skies over Southern California.The National Weather Service's office in Los Angeles said a weather system known as an \"atmospheric river\" was bringing isolated thunderstorms, along with heavy rain, flooding, and flash flooding to the region on March 5 when 1,500 pulses of lightning were recorded off the coast in one 5-minute stretch.Time exposure photos posted by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department to Twitter showed the series of lightning strikes over Santa Barbara, Calif., including shots taken from Stearns Wharf in the city's harbor late Tuesday.

Around 3 million hectares (7.4 million acres) of land has burned nationwide during a torrid past few months, with nine people killed and more than 800 homes destroyed.The devastation has put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has received criticism for going on a family vacation in Hawaii during the wildfire crisis.

{"title": "New Zealand mission to recover bodies from 'highly volatile' volcano island gets underway", "body": "A daring mission to retrieve the bodies of eight victims of the New Zealand volcano eruption got underway early Friday, even though scientists said they believe there is a risk for another eruption.New Zealand police said the recovery mission will involve a team of eight military specialists as part of the \"high-speed recovery\" of the bodies, which Police Deputy Commissioner Mike Clement acknowledged was “not without risk.”\"They will go onto the island and they will make every effort to recover all of the bodies,\" Clement said at a news conference.Clement said early Friday that the location of six of the bodies is already known, but finding the other two may be difficult, according to broadcaster RNZ. Once officials are able to recover the remains, they will be taken to the navy ship Wellington that is waiting close by.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7641_News_0>The continuing volcanic activity has delayed the recovery of the last victims since Monday's deadly eruption, which occurred as 47 tourists and their guides were exploring the island. In addition to the eight bodies left on the island, eight other people were killed and dozens were severely burned by the blast of scalding steam and ash.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7641_News_1>As the team of military specialists was boarding a helicopter to be sent to the island, locals gathered along the shoreline in Whakatane to sing and pray while awaiting the return of the bodies, according to the New Zealand Herald.One woman told a reporter from the Herald as a haka was performed: \"This is one way we can contribute together for their safe travels and safe return.\"Police have cited the need to preserve evidence that would help identify the victims as a reason to take a methodical approach, but the decision to make a faster recovery attempt appeared to have been partly motivated by weather forecasts.Rain mixing with the heavy volcanic ash lying on the island could encase the bodies in a cement-like substance, making recovery more difficult.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7641_News_2>\"A lot has to go right for us tomorrow to make this work,\" police said Thursday.Before the mission got underway, GeoNet, New Zealand's geological hazard information site, said Thursday there was a 50 to 60 percent chance of another eruption within the next 24 hours.The seismic monitoring agency has maintained the island's volcanic alert level at 2, noting there's been no eruption since Monday. On the scale, 2 signifies unrest while 5 signifies a major eruption.Volcanologist Nico Fournier warned earlier that White Island remained “highly volatile\" after Monday's blast. White Island is the tip of a mostly undersea volcano that's about 30 miles off New Zealand's North Island and has been visited by thousands of tourists each year. It's also the country's most active cone volcano.As the recovery operation gets underway, New Zealand medical staff were working around the clock to treat the injured survivors in hospital burn units.On Thursday, a tourist injured in the eruption was transported to an Australian Air Force plane in Hamilton, New Zealand to be taken elsewhere for additional treatment.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7641_News_3>The enormity of the task was clear when Dr. Peter Watson, a chief medical officer, said at a news conference that extra skin has been ordered from American skin banks. Hospital personnel anticipated needing an extra 1,300 square feet of skin for grafting onto the patients, Watson said.Australian tissue banks have sent 21 square feet to New Zealand to help the survivors.“Skin is predominantly used in patients who have the most life-threatening burns, usually if they have more than 50% burn over their body,” said Stefan Poniatowski, head of Donor Tissue Bank Victoria.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7641_News_4>A patient with that amount of burned skin doesn't have enough of their own healthy skin to transplant onto the wounded area, he explained. Additionally, in patients with an infection, creating a new wound to transfer their own skin is too risky, Poniatowski said.Authorities say 24 Australians, nine Americans, five New Zealanders, four Germans, two Britons, two Chinese and a Malaysian were visiting the island at the time of the eruption.

White Island sits about 30 miles offshore from mainland New Zealand and experts say it's the country's most active cone volcano, with about 70 percent of the volcano lying under the sea.\"Police believe that anyone who could have been taken from the island alive was rescued at the time of the evacuation,\" police stated. \"Based on the information we have, we do not believe there are any survivors on the island.\"Police Deputy Commissioner John Tims said at a news conference there were 47 people on the island when it erupted and that eight remain missing.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_0>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters that 31 people were in seven hospitals, including some in critical condition, while three had been discharged overnight.

Rescuers have reported that the volcano has generated \"significant\" ash that is impeding efforts to return to the island.\"The experts that we've spoken to have said it is unsafe for us to go on that island. The island is unstable, the physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island,\" Tims told reporters. \"It is important that we consider the health and safety of those that will return to the island.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_2>Police said in a news release their response has shifted to a recovery operation, and that a ship from the New Zealand Defense Forces will approach the perimeter of the island at first light on Tuesday to deploy drones and observational equipment to further assess the environment.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_3>A total of 37 passengers and one crew member from the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship Ovation of the Seas were affected by the blast, according to police.“A number of our guests were touring the island today,\" the company said. “We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities. Please keep all those affected in your prayers.”The cruise ship, which had left Sydney last week, was scheduled to sail to the capital Wellington on Monday night but the company said it would instead remain in the Tauranga port overnight until it learned more about the situation.“My god,” wrote Michael Schade on Twitter as he posted a video of the eruption. “My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it. Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable.”His video showed a wall of ash and steam around the island and a helicopter badly damaged and covered in ash.Scott said one woman was badly injured but seemed “strong” by the end.Ardern, who traveled to the region late Monday, said the incident was “very significant.\"“All our thoughts are with those affected,” she said.Ardern said the focus remained on the search-and-rescue mission for now and questions about whether tourists should be visiting would be addressed later. But many people are questioning why tourists were still able to visit the island after scientists recently noted an uptick in volcanic activity.The GeoNet agency, which monitors volcanoes and earthquakes in New Zealand, had raised the alert level on White Island from 1 to 2 on Nov. 18, noting an increase in the amount of sulfur dioxide gas, which originates from magma deep in the volcano. It also said at the time that over the previous weeks, the volcanic tremor had increased from weak to moderate strength.Brad Scott, a volcanologist with research group GNS Science, said the alert level was often raised and then later dropped again without any eruption. He said there hadn't been any major incidents with tourists visiting the island in the past, although there had been some close calls<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_4>GeoNet at first raised its alert level to 4, on a scale where 5 represents a major eruption. It later dropped the alert level back down to 3. Scott said that was because the eruption wasn't sustained beyond the initial blast.“In the scheme of things, for volcanic eruptions, it is not large,\" Ken Gledhill from GeoNet told the Associated Press. “But if you were close to that, it is not good.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/new-zealand-volcano-white-island-tourist-no-signs-of-life", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "This aerial photo shows White Island after its volcanic eruption in New Zealand Monday, Dec. 9, 2019.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/nz4.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this image released by GeoNet, tourists can be seen near the volcano's crater Monday, Dec. 9, 2019, on White Island, New Zealand.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/nz3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Emergency services attend to an injured person arriving at the Whakatane Airfield after the volcanic eruption Monday, Dec. 9, 2019, on White Island, New Zealand.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/nz2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Emergency services attend to an injured person arriving at the Whakatane Airfield after the volcanic eruption Monday, Dec. 9, 2019, on White Island, New Zealand.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/nz1.jpg"}, {"caption": "This image released by GNS Science, shows plumes of smoke from a volcanic eruption on White Island, seen from Whakatane, New Zealand Monday, Dec. 9, 2019.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7656_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/nz5.jpg"}]}

The couple was living in Alice Springs and had been showing local landmarks to Tran, who was visiting from the south coast city of Adelaide at the time, according to the Associated Press.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7660_News_0>On Sunday, officials announced they found McBeath-Riley alive near a waterhole where the group had been staying. At a news conference on Monday, the 52-year-old said that Hockridg and Tran began the 12-mile journey to reach a nearby highway, planning to avoid the desert heat -- which came close to 104 Fahrenheit in recent days -- by walking at night and carrying whatever water they could find.During the day, the group dug a hole underneath the car to stay cool and then slept in the vehicle at night, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. During that time period, the trio survived on six liters of water, 10 cans of iced vodka, a packet of biscuits and some beef noodles.Vicary told Australia's NT News that Tran and Hockridge separated after finding the fence on the farm property, and the 40-year-old decided to follow the fence line for two days until he was discovered by the farmer and given water.Tran was found by cattle rancher Ted Fogarty on Tuesday. Tran and McBeath-Riley were both treated at an Alice Springs hospital for dehydration and exposure.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7660_News_1>Fogarty said he found Tran at a water tank on his property where Tran had been drinking and cooling since Monday.

Rama embraced the woman and tried to console her.In Durres, the Albanian prime minister was accompanied by Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, who had been visiting neighboring North Macedonia earlier in the day.“We have been through this, we know this, we will do whatever we can to help,” said Dendias, whose country is also in a highly seismically active region and was among more than a dozen countries sending search-and-rescue teams to Albania. “We stand with the Albanian people, with its government, to offer whatever we can.”Defense Minister Olta Xhacka said the search-and-rescue efforts were “extremely difficult operations, where you have to work slowly because there is a high risk of further collapse, endangering not only residents, but also those trapped, and the rescuers themselves.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7668_News_3>About 400 soldiers set up some 200 tents in Durres and in Fushe Kruje near Thumane in the north to house survivors left homeless by the quake.As night fell, hundreds of people were taking shelter in the tents, while others were traveling to relatives living in other parts of Albania that had not been affected.Seismologist Rrapo Ormeni of Albania’s Institute of Geosciences, Energy, Water, and Environment, said a 6.4 quake was considered strong.“Damage at the epicenter will be considerable because of its high energy, the magnitude it has,” Ormeni said. “Such quakes are felt in a wider area due to (their) major depth and magnitude. It has been felt all around the territory of our country but also abroad, up to Bulgaria, Bosnia, Italy and other (countries).”The quake was also felt in neighboring Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Greece, and parts of southern Serbia.Authorities called on people in the most affected areas to stay out of their homes and avoid driving to allow emergency vehicles free access.Rama said neighboring countries, the European Union and the United States had offered help. By Tuesday evening, rescue teams from neighboring Kosovo, Montenegro, Italy, Greece and Romania had arrived. Serbia, North Macedonia, Croatia, Hungary, Germany, France, Estonia, Turkey and the Czech Republic also offered help, while the EU delegation to Albania said additional EU assets were on standby should they be needed.An earthquake in September in roughly the same area damaged hundreds of homes.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/powerful-earthquake-hits-albania", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7668_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "People stand next to a damaged hotel after an earthquake, in Durres, western Albania.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_7668_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/AP19330204963784.jpg"}, {"caption": "Rescuers search at a collapsed building after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake in Thumane, western Albania, Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2019.

It was the third time since Tuesday night's 6 foot, 1 inch flood -- the worst in 53 years -- that water levels have topped nearly 5 feet in less than a week.Water flooded St. Mark's Square, causing stores and museums to close as merchants tried to either elevate items away from water or attempt to use a combination of barriers, vacuums and mops to keep the brackish water out of their shops.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7682_News_0>The mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, said on Saturday the city was preparing for another “tough day” but that the situation was expected to be less dramatic.But even though officials closed down the historic square due to the rising waters, tourists kept arriving on Sunday with many donning plastic garbage bags and knee-high boots.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7682_News_1>“We made the reservation this week before the floods and had paid already, so we came,” Luca D’Acun to, a 28-year-old from Naples visiting with his girlfriend, told the Associated Press. “Instead of a romantic trip, we’ll have an adventurous one.”The doors of the famed St. Mark’s Basilica were securely shut to the public, while officials took precautions — stacking sandbags in canal-side windows — to prevent water from entering the crypt again.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7682_News_2>Most museums were closed as a precaution, but the Correr Museum, which overlooks St. Mark’s Square and explores the art and history of Venice, remained open.Officials said 280 civil protection volunteers from throughout the region were deployed to assist as needed. Young Venetian volunteers in rubber boots have also shown up at key sites, including the city’s Music Conservatory, to help save precious manuscripts from the invading saltwater.Brugnaro, who has been appointed a special commissioner to deal with the emergency, estimated damages from the flooding in the city since Tuesday at around $1.1 billion, according to Reuters.The flooding has raised renewed debates about the city’s Moses flood defense project, a corruption-riddled underwater barrier system that is still not operational after more than 16 years of construction and at least 5 billion euros of public funding.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7682_News_3>Officials have also been going back and forth about the perils Venice faces from sinking into the mud and rising sea levels due to climate change.Venice was not the only place in Italy dealing with severe weather over the weekend.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7682_News_4>Authorities in Florence and Pisa were also closely monitoring the Arno river, whose water levels rose rapidly in the night due to heavy rain, according to Reuters.In Italy’s mountainous Alto Adige, or South Tyrol region, a mid-autumn snowstorm triggered power outages and blocked roads in several Alpine valleys.

Kyodo News agency, citing its own tally, put the death toll at 69.As the storm approached over the weekend, two men who tried to go to an evacuation shelter were denied from entering because they were informed they were not ward residents since they were homeless.“The wind was strong and it was raining, and I wanted them to let me in,” a 64-year-old homeless man told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.The 64-year-old man told the newspaper he ended up spending the night under a plastic umbrella partially shielded below an underhang from a building's roof.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7786_News_0>Another homeless man was also turned away from the same facility later that day for the same reason, the newspaper reported.While no deaths have been reported in Tokyo, news of the ward officials denying homeless people entry caused a firestorm on social media and among homeless advocates.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7786_News_1>“Is this a country that’s going to host the Olympics in Tokyo?” one man with the handle @G_takatoshi asked on Twitter, according to Reuters.The topic also was brought up during a session of the government focusing on emergency response to the storm, with one opposition member questioning Abe about the incident\"We should respect the basic human rights of disaster victims and provide necessary facilities for them,\" said Yuko Mori of Democratic Party for the People, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. \"That's a basic principle.\"Abe replied that evacuation centers should \"properly accept all people.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7786_News_2>\"We will examine what really happened with the local governments and take appropriate measures,\" he said.In the Taito ward where the incident took place, officials said Tuesday they would review procedures to help people without addresses.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_7786_News_3>“We deeply apologize that we dealt with people without addresses insufficiently so that they could not stay at the shelter,” the mayor of the ward, Yukuo Hattori, said in a statement on its website. “We will cooperate with related parties and consider measures to support all the people at the time of a disaster.”Hagibis hit Japan's main island on Saturday with strong winds and historic rainfall that caused more than 200 rivers to overflow, leaving thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power.

It said the storm had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph and was located about 945 miles west-southwest of Cork, Ireland, as it moved northeast at 43 mph.\"Only slow weakening is forecast during the next day or so, and the system is expected to be a strong extratropical cyclone when it approaches Ireland Thursday afternoon and evening,\" forecasters said. \"A faster rate of weakening is expected when the cyclone moves over Ireland and England.\"Hurricanes the size of Lorenzo are rare so far north and east in the Atlantic basin.

{"title": "Hurricane Dorian, Category 5 storm, makes landfall in Bahamas with 185 mph winds", "body": "A menacing Hurricane Dorian made landfall in the northern Bahamas midday Sunday after strengthening to a \"catastrophic\" Category 5 storm -- packing winds of 185 mph and the threat of torrential rain that could last for days as millions in the U.S. along the Southeast coast from Florida to North Carolina are keeping an eye on where the storm may head next.The National Hurricane Center said in a 2 p.m. ET Sunday advisory that Dorian was a Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 185 mph and it was moving west at 7 mph, located directly over Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. The storm made the first landfall at 12:40 p.m. in Elbow Cay and is located about 185 miles east of West Palm Beach, Florida.\"This is a life-threatening situation. Residents there should take immediate shelter,\" the NHC said. Do not venture into the eye if it passes over your location.\"Wind gusts of over 220 mph and a storm surge of 18 to 23 feet above normal tide levels with higher \"destructive waves\" are forecast to continue for several hours over the affected areas. The storm is tied for number two for the highest sustained winds on record in an Atlantic hurricane, according to Fox News Chief Meteorologist Rick Reichmuth.\"Right now one of the strongest storms in history for this region,\" NHC Director Ken Graham said in a morning briefing. The NHC said that Dorian is tied for the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall on record with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, and has since made a second landfall at 2 p.m. on Great Abaco Island near Marsh Harbour.Dorian is an \"extremely dangerous\" hurricane according to Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean, who said the storm is set to deliver a \"devastating blow\" to the northwest Bahamas Sunday through Monday.\"A perfect beast of a storm,\" Dean said Sunday morning on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding that the northwestern Bahamas have never had a direct impact of a Category 5 storm before.\"This is not a storm to be messed with,\" Dean added.In the northern stretches of the Bahamas archipelago, hundreds of people hunkered down in schools, churches, and other shelters as Dorian approached. Power and water outages were reported, with crews working in some communities as authorities warned that all government workers will remain indoors once winds reach 40 mph.Conditions were deteriorating rapidly in the Bahamas on Sunday morning. Video from ZNS Bahamas from 9:30 a.m. showed water rising as winds were picking up.\"The winds have definitely picked up. Trees are banging, they're swaying. They've even breaking,\" ZNS reporter Megan Shepherd said in a video posted to Twitter.Another Twitter user posted a video to Twitter from a family member of the storm's fierce winds reaching Abaco.Another resident of the Bahamas reported that Abaco was \"almost underwater\" as the storm approached.Government spokesman Kevin Harris said Sunday that Dorian is expected to impact some 73,000 residents and 21,000 homes. Authorities closed airports for The Abaco Islands, Grand Bahama, and Bimini, but Lynden Pindling International Airport at the capital of Nassau remained open.\"There's fear,\" American Jack Pittard told the Associated Press in a phone interview Sunday morning as the eyewall approached the islands. \"I'm worried about destruction of property, but I don't believe there's going to be loss of lives here.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8091_News_0>Officials in the Bahamas said Sunday that dozens of people were ignoring evacuation orders, and they were warned that they were placing their lives in danger. Among those refusing to leave were 32 people in Sweetings Cay, and a group that sought safety in Old Bahama Bay resort, which officials said was not safe.\"The end could be fatal,\" said Samuel Butler, assistant police commissioner, told the AP. \"We ask you, we beg you, we plead with you to get to a place of safety.\"Butler said officials were closing certain roads with heavy equipment and warned that those on the other side would be stranded until after Dorian has passed. The government has opened 14 shelters across the Bahamas.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8091_News_1>\"We cannot stress the amount of devastation and catastrophic impact that Hurricane Dorian is expected to bring,\" said Shavonne Moxey-Bonamy, the Bahamas chief meteorologist.Forecasters warn that Dorian's slow-motion may bring a prolonged period of life-threatening storm surge, devastating hurricane-force winds, and heavy rains capable of producing life-threatening flash floods on the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama through Monday.The NHC said that data at 9:30 a.m. from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft show the hurricane has continued to intensify.Between 12 to 24 inches of rain is forecast for the northwestern Bahamas, with isolated amounts up to 30 inches, according to the NHC. Dorian is also forecast to bring a life-threatening storm surge with water levels raised as much as 15 to 20 feet above normal in areas of onshore winds on the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama Island.\"Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,\" the NHC said.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asked Floridians to keep the Bahamas in their thoughts while also preparing for whatever impacts Dorian may bring. The Sunshine State declared a state of emergency last week ahead of the storm of assist with preparations.\"The Bahamas are going to get absolutely leveled by this thing because this thing's a strong storm. The Bahamas are flat,\" DeSantis said Saturday. They got no defense to this storm and it's going to churn over there; it's going to dump perhaps 2 feet of rain on the Bahamas.\"Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis warned that Dorian is a \"dangerous storm\" and said any \"who do not evacuate are placing themselves in extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence.\"Small skiffs shuttled Saturday between outlying fishing communities and McLean's Town, a settlement of a few dozen homes at the eastern end of Grand Bahama island, about 150 miles from Florida's Atlantic coast. Most people came from Sweeting Cay, a fishing town of a few hundred people about 5 feet above sea level.\"We're not taking no chances,\" Margaret Bassett, a ferry boat driver for the Deep Water Cay resort, told the AP. \"They said evacuate, you have to evacuate.\"The slow-moving storm may take until Monday afternoon to pass over the Bahamas, and then turn sharply and skirt up the U.S. coast, possibly staying just off Florida and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday and then affecting South Carolina and North Carolina on Thursday.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8091_News_2>But forecasters warn that Dorian's path could easily shift and bring some of the worst conditions to coastal locations.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8091_News_3>\"If there is a difference in the track by 30 miles, that's the difference between tropical-storm-force and hurricane winds,\" Dean said Sunday on \"Fox & Friends.\" That's why we have to wait for every forecast.\"President Trump, who canceled his planned trip to Poland this weekend to monitor Dorian, said Sunday morning that in addition to Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\"Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5,\" Trump tweeted. \"BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\"Weather officials in Alabama, however, stressed that Alabama will not see any impacts from Dorian.\"We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama,\" NWS Birmingham said on Twitter. \"The system will remain too far east.\"In Florida, Palm Beach County issued the evacuation order beginning 1 p.m. Sunday after the county that includes West Palm Beach was placed under a tropical storm warning.The evacuation includes barrier islands, mobile homes, and areas that are prone to flood because of Hurricane Dorian.While the official forecast path for Dorian curves the storm away from the area before it strikes land, the NHC said there is about a 50 percent chance West Palm Beach will get hurricane winds by early Wednesday.On Saturday, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency, mobilizing state resources to prepare for potential storm effects. President Trump already declared a state of emergency and was brief late Saturday about the storm.The hurricane upended some Labor Day holiday weekend plans in the U.S.: Major airlines allowed travelers to change their reservations without fees, big cruise lines rerouted their ships and Cumberland Island National Seashore off Georgia closed to visitors.

{"title": "Focus on Brazil's Amazon fires, but a massive inferno rages next door in Bolivia", "body": "As Brazil’s Amazon fires continue to take center stage, another South American nation is battling its own catastrophic blazes, which have destroyed an area of land nearly as large as Lebanon.The Chiquitanía region of southeastern Bolivia, consisting of dry forest, farmland and open prairies, has seen the greatest damage from the nearly 40,000 fires that have charred 3,700 square miles to date, according to the country’s National Forests and Lands Authority.The fires, which have now spread to Bolivia’s share of the Amazon, have destroyed $1.1 billion worth of timber.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8160_News_0>Over two square miles of forestry in the northeastern region of Bení have been scorched so far and officials are fearful that a fire in Bolivia’s Amazon could threaten the indigenous communities.Fernando Vargas, an indigenous leader in the Isiboro Sécure Indigenous territory and national park, told The Guardian that fires present one of the largest threats to “biodiversity in Bolivia,” adding that the fires were “man-made” and not a natural occurrence.Others throughout the country have also argued that Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, is to blame.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8160_News_1>Morales signed a measure in July allowing controlled burns and clearing of lands. While people were supposed to obtain prior permission, authorities said most of the fires had been started illegally.He also granted an amnesty for people caught burning fields illegally last year.On Tuesday, Morales was in one of the affected regions overseeing firefighting efforts involving more than 3,500 people, including soldiers, police and volunteers.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8160_News_2>Morales has also agreed to receive aid from the international community, unlike Brazilian President Jai Bolsonaro. Bolivia contracted the world's largest firefighting tanker plane from the U.S. this week in addition to receiving two helicopter tankers from neighboring Peru.Bolsonaro’s government initially declined an offer from the Group of Seven nations summit in France over the weekend, where the heads of state and government pledged $40 million — $20 million from the group, $12 million from the United Kingdom and $11 million from Canada — to help fight the fires.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8160_News_3>He has since said he will consider the offer pending an apology from France regarding comments he deemed offensive.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/brazil-amazon-fire-bolivia-inferno", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8160_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Soldiers work to put out a forest fire in the Chiquitania Forest of Quitunuquina near the Robore, Bolivia, Monday, Aug. 26, 2019.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8160_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/bolivia-fires-3-AP.jpg"}, {"caption": "On Saturday, several helicopters along with police, military troops, firefighters and volunteers on the ground worked to extinguish fires in Bolivia's Chiquitania region, where the woods are dry at this time of year.

ET update that Tropical Storm Dorian is located about 370 miles east-southeast of Ponce, Puerto Rico and moving west-northwest at 13 mph with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph.Hurricane watches have been posted for  Puerto Rico and for the Dominican Republic from Isla Saona to Samaná, and tropical storm warnings are in effect for Puerto Rico and the same parts of the Dominican Republic. The center said the storm is forecast to strengthen during the next 48 hours before passing near or south of the U.S. territory.In Puerto Rico, Gov. Wanda Vázquez signed an executive order on Monday declaring a state of emergency and provided a list of all the new equipment that public agencies have bought since Hurricane Maria.\"I want everyone to feel calm,\" she said. \"Agency directors have prepared for the last two years. The experience of Maria has been a great lesson for everyone.\"Public schools are scheduled to close by Tuesday afternoon and at least one cruise ship canceled its trip to Puerto Rico, according to the governor. Government officials said that 360 shelters will be made available for those who do not have a safe place available to ride out the storm.The governor said about 24,000 cots have been distributed across the island so far.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8163_News_0>Some grocery stores ran out of bottled water on Monday as people rushed to buy supplies, including generators, and filled their cars with gas. Many are worried about power outages and heavy rains on an island still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit in September 2017.Some 30,000 homes on Puerto Rico still have blue tarps as roofs and the electrical grid remains fragile and prone to outages even during brief rain showers.Dorian knocked out power overnight in Barbados, where crews began clearing downed trees and repairing the electrical grid early Tuesday.

{"title": "Brazil dispatches troops, military aircraft to battle Amazon forest fires", "body": "The Brazilian military is deploying troops to the Amazon to fight the massive wildfires that have swept the region and sparked an international outcry.Brazil's defense minister has said that some 44,000 troops will be available for \"unprecedented\" operations to put out the fires, and forces are heading to six Brazilian states that asked for federal help. The states are Roraima, Rondonia, Tocantins, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso.\"The protection of the forest is our duty,\" Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro said in a televised address Friday. \"We are aware of that and will act to combat deforestation and criminal activities that put people at risk in the Amazon. We are a government of zero tolerance for crime, and in the environmental field it will not be different.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8176_News_0>The military's first mission will be carried out by 700 troops around Porto Velho, capital of Rondonia, Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo said. The military will use two C-130 Hercules aircraft capable of dumping up to 12,000 liters (3,170 gallons) of water on fires, he said.“It shows the concern of Bolsonaro’s government about this issue,” Azevedo said. “It was a very fast response.”An Associated Press journalist flying over the Porto Velho region Saturday morning reported hazy conditions and low visibility. On Friday, the reporter saw many already deforested areas that were burned, apparently by people clearing farmland, as well as a large column of smoke billowing from one fire.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8176_News_1>The municipality of Nova Santa Helena in Brazil's Mato Grosso state was also hard-hit. Trucks were seen driving along a highway Friday as fires blazed and embers smoldered in adjacent fields.Azevedo noted a tweet from President Trump in which the American leader where he offered to help Brazil fight the fires but added that Brazilia and Washington had no further communication on the subject.Even so, the U.S. has already started to help fight the massive wildfires. A Boeing 747-400 Global SuperTanker firefighting plane carrying nearly 20,000 of retardant, a substance used to stop fires, arrived at the Bolivia-Brazil border from California Friday.Bolsonaro has previously described rainforest protections as an obstacle to Brazil’s economic development, sparring with critics who say the Amazon absorbs vast amounts of greenhouse gasses and is crucial for efforts to contain climate change.The Amazon fires have become a global issue, escalating tensions between Brazil and European countries who believe Bolsonaro has neglected commitments to protect biodiversity. Protesters gathered outside Brazilian diplomatic missions in European and Latin American cities Friday, and demonstrators also marched in Brazil.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8176_News_2>The dispute spilled into the economic arena when French President Emmanuel Macron threatened to block a European Union trade deal with Brazil and several other South American countries. He wants Group of Seven leaders meeting at a summit in France this weekend to discuss the Amazon crisis.“First we need to help Brazil and other countries put out these fires,” Macron said Saturday.The goal is to “preserve this forest that we all need because it is a treasure of our biodiversity and our climate thanks to the oxygen that it emits and thanks to the carbon it absorbs,” he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8176_News_3>Bolivia has also struggled to contain fires that swept through woods and fields. The government of Bolivian President Evo Morales has backed the increased cultivation of crops for biofuel production, raising questions about whether the policy opened the way to increased burning. The Bolivian government says 3,680 square miles have been burned this year.On Saturday, several helicopters along with police, military troops, firefighters and volunteers on the ground worked to extinguish fires in Bolivia's Chiquitanía region, where the woods are dry at this time of year.Similarly, Bolsonaro had said he wants to convert land for cattle pastures and soybean farms. Brazilian prosecutors are investigating whether lax enforcement of environmental regulations may have contributed to the surge in the number of fires.Fires are common in Brazil in the annual dry season, but they are much more widespread this year. Brazilian state experts reported nearly 77,000 wildfires across the country so far this year, up 85% over the same period in 2018.

{"title": "Florida hurricanes predicted by scientist with unique technique", "body": "BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. — Months after Hurricane Michael bruised the Florida Panhandle and Irma slammed into the Florida Keys, the state is bracing for what comes next. One scientist is digging for those answers underwater.\"It's a relatively new science,\" said Joanne Muller, a scientist in the Water School at Florida Gulf Coast University.Muller said she has been \"coring\" for more than 20 years. The technique involves digging in the dirt underwater to uncover information about hurricanes from thousands of years ago that can help predict how strong future hurricanes will be.\"We sample the cores, we can date the sediment using radio-metric tools, and then we know how old those hurricane layers are, going back through time,\"  Muller explained.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_0>By examining the hurricane layers in the core, Muller can discover the geological record using clues such as sand and shells..\"We can say the top is zero years, so this is present day, and then we'll get dates throughout the core. Maybe 100 years, 1,000 years, 2,000 years … so we know exactly when these storms occurred historically, how far they go back in time and how many there were at different periods,\" she said.As part of the coring process, Muller and her team use long aluminum pipes to pull samples from the muck and dirt of the sea floor. On a recent ride out with Fox News, the team took samples in Estero Bay just north of Naples, Florida, an area Muller said has seen a lot of hurricane activity in the past.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_1>\"We are pretty much looking for a really organic bottom. A lot of dark sediment, really fluffy sediment that we can get a core through,\" said Adam Catasus, a Florida Gulf Coast University researcher.After they get the core samples, the scientist suctions the top of the aluminum pipes to prevent the sediment from falling out. Muller said some of the oldest hurricane overwash layers her team has found date to between 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.Muller said one patch she dug up was likely placed in the 1960s when Hurricane Donna made landfall.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_2>By studying patterns in the sediment, Muller points to evidence that forecasts more severe hurricanes. She matches up hurricane records with sea surface temperatures to predict the chaos these massive storms will create as sea temperatures continue to rise.\"What we're seeing are more intense hurricanes and 2017 is an excellent example of that. So at the moment, we're projecting that we'll see more intense hurricanes in the future and the geologic record that we are uncovering, is showing the same thing,\" Muller said.Her predictions match up with the latest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_3>NOAA warns of above-normal hurricane activity, with the possibility of five to nine hurricanes. At least two of those could be major hurricanes.\"The effort that we're working toward is trying to fill in the gaps of the National Hurricane Center's HURDAT database. So this is a database that has all the information on storms that have occurred from present day, going back about 160 years. The work that we're doing is really trying to make that database a lot stronger to fill in gaps so that we can be more realistic about hurricanes in the future,” Muller said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_4>Muller said the importance of her work goes beyond the research. \"These cores, they tell a story and it's the thing that I love so much about geology, there's so much history there. It's really important that we can understand them as best as we can so that we can make more accurate predictions going forward.\"Hurricane season lasts until Nov. 30.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//science/intense-florida-hurricanes-predicted-technique", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Scientist Joanne Muller matches up hurricane records with sea surface temperatures to predict the chaos these massive storms will create.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Muller-matches-up-hurricane-records-with-sea-surface-temperatures-to-predict-the-chaos-these-tropical-cyclones-will-create..jpg"}, {"caption": "After they gather the sediment from underwater, they cut the tubes in half and start their research.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/After-they-gather-the-sediment-from-undewater-they-cut-the-tubes-in-half-and-start-their-research..jpg"}, {"caption": "Muller drives an aluminum pipe down into the sediment underwater, and then suctions the top with red caps on the end until they split it open for research.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8196_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Muller-drives-an-aluminum-pipe-down-into-the-sediment-underwater-and-then-suctions-the-top-with-red-caps-on-the-end.jpg"}, {"caption": "Muller explains the coring process.

A total of 162 children have been tested in Paris after hundreds of tons of lead in Notre Dame’s spire and roof melted in the blaze.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8206_News_0>Of those, 16 were deemed to be just short of being “at-risk” and will also be monitored as a precaution, the Associated Press reported last week.The results \"show, on the one hand, the need to keep cleaning to limit the risk of exposure of the children to lead and, on the other hand, the importance of extending blood tests,\" the health authority said.Authorities in June recommended blood tests for children under 7 and pregnant women who live near Notre Dame as they are especially vulnerable to health problems from lead poisoning and exposure.Critics have said authorities did not move fast enough to protect workers and residents from lead pollution.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8206_News_1>On Tuesday, high fences blocked Parisians and tourists from several streets and a bridge around the Gothic cathedral.New equipment – including decontamination units – and stricter safety procedures have been implemented to ensure workers are not exposed to unsafe levels of led.

The Royal Meteorological Institute said that it was \"the highest ever Belgian temperature.\"Paris and other parts of France could see temperatures exceeding 104 Fahrenheit on Thursday along with Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8234_News_0>Paris is likely to break its all-time hottest record mark of 104.7 Fahrenheit, according to weather officials.The heat is putting pressure on authorities to help protect the vulnerable, but it is also raising alarm for those working repairing the fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8234_News_1>The cathedral’s chief architect, Philippe Villeneuve, told reporters Wednesday he is afraid the heat wave could leave the vaulted ceilings at risk of collapse.Villeneuve said the stone walls are still saturated with water sprayed by firefighters during the April 15 blaze, and that they could dry too fast amid the record temperatures expected in Paris this week. He said so far the masonry is stable but the structure remains fragile.“What I fear is that the joints or the masonry, as they dry, lose their coherence, their cohesion, and their structural qualities and that all of sudden, the vault gives way,\" he said.Dozens of sensors dotted around the 12th-century monument have shown no indication that it's deteriorating, but Villeneuve said the vaulted ceiling “could very well” collapse, according to Reuters. While experts have had access to the bell towers and other parts of the cathedral, Villeneuve said they have not been able to access the ceiling from above or below.“I am very worried about the heat wave,” he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8234_News_2>Specialists are still working to stabilize the cathedral's structure before reconstruction work begins. French authorities activated a heat wave alert plan, classing it as an Orange alert, the second-highest level of warning, France 24 reported.Forecasters in the U.K meanwhile warned Thursday could also be the hottest day ever recorded, with temperatures likely to reach 102 Fahrenheit somewhere in southern and eastern England.The current all-time record is 101.2 Fahrenheit logged in Faversham in August 2013, according to Sky News.Authorities are urging people to stay out of the sun, drink plenty of water and check on older people living alone.

In the Lewisham district of the British capital, garbage collectors will start working as early as 5 a.m. in the morning to beat the heat.The second heat wave this summer is expected to be a relatively short event fueled by hot dry air from northern Africa, but authorities are taking precautions to protect vulnerable residents. Air conditioning is not common at homes, offices, schools or hospitals in European cities.The weather is also aggravating droughts since it hasn't rained much in many parts of Europe this summer. The combination of heat, wind and possible lightning from thunderstorms also increases the risk of wildfires.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8234_News_4>In the Netherlands, local authorities have taken an unusual precaution — with trucks scattering salt on the roads like they usually do in the winter. The salt spreaders are usually used to prevent ice forming on Dutch roads in the cold, but Arnhem municipality started using them to cool off asphalt that is baking.The city says in a statement that the salt \"attracts moisture from the air and cools the asphalt.\" It also prevents asphalt from becoming sticky.The heat wave will end in a few days.

The jet, destined for Murmansk, had turned back after takeoff.Among the dead included, was flight attendant Maxim Moiseev, according to Dietrich.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8482_News_0>Moiseev was in the rear of the plane as it landed and stayed inside as the aircraft became engulfed in flames, Russia's TASS News Agency reported.\"He was trying to open the rear exit door to quickly evacuate the passengers from the tail that was ablaze,\" an aviation source told TASS. \"He didn’t succeed and started helping people to leave the plane.\"TASS reported that Moiseev stayed on board trying to get people off the aircraft, and died in the fire.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8482_News_1>Another flight attendant, Tatyana Kasatkina, told the Lenta news agency those on board had just seconds to escape the plane, and she grabbed passengers by their collars to hurl them down escape chutes.\"People starting getting out of their seats and making for the exit while the jet was still traveling at high speed,\" she told Lenta. \"They were phoning relatives, screaming that the plane was burning and falling.\"One survivor praised the plane's attendants for helping save him and others.\"It was dark and there was gas, very high temperature. They helped people out of there, helped them to descend,\" Dmity Khlebnikov said, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda.Video on Russian TV showed the plane's underside bursting into flames and spewing black smoke after making a hard landing Sunday night. Those who escaped leaped out of the plane down inflatable emergency slides and ran across the tarmac.Most of those who died are believed to have been choked by the smoke, TASS reported.Russia's main investigative body said Monday that both flight recorders have been recovered from the plane. Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko was also quoted by Russian news agencies as saying investigators are looking into three main possibilities behind the cause of the disaster: insufficient pilot qualifications, equipment failure and weather.The pilot of the airliner, Denis Evdokimov, was quoted by Russian media as saying the plane was without radio communications because of a lightning strike. The plane had taken off for Murmansk in stormy weather but quickly turned back for an emergency landing, according to Sky News.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8482_News_2>\"We took off, got into a cloud, there was strong hail, and at that moment there was a pop and some kind of flash, like electricity,\" Kasatnika told state TV.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8482_News_3>The plane reportedly did not jettison any fuel before the landing, as is a common procedure. It was not clear why it did not take the time to do that.The SSJ100, also known as the Superjet, was heralded when it went into service in 2011 as part of a new phase for Russia's civil aviation industry, but the jet has been troubled by concerns about defects in the horizontal stabilizers.

{"title": "Argentine Navy submarine may have 'imploded'; photos show wreckage on sea floor", "body": "The Argentine submarine that was lost deep in the sea with 44 crew members on board may have suffered from a partial implosion close to the seabed, a senior official said Sunday as officials released photos of the wreckage.The country's navy announced Saturday that the ARA San Juan was discovered at a depth of 2,975 feet in the waters off the Valdes Peninsula and was surrounded by a field of rubble, with underwater turbulence making visibility difficult.Naval Capt. Enrique Balbi said the working theory was that the vessel had partially imploded while at sea, deep down near the seabed, Sky News reported.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8770_News_0>Photos released on Sunday showed the wreckage of the submarine in the Atlantic Ocean, with sections of the vessel lying on the ocean floor. Parts of its propellers were buried and debris was scattered up to 230 feet away.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8770_News_1>The pieces of the submarine, which included a propeller and the sub's bow with torpedo launching tubes, had been \"crushed inwards,\" according to Balbi.The sub's discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a one-year commemoration for its disappearance on Nov. 15, 2017. The San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8770_News_2>The navy said previously the captain reported on November 15, 2017 that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.Hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \"concentration of hydrogen\" triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.The German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8770_News_3>After announcing the discovery of the submarine, Defense Minister Oscar Aguad disclosed that the country will be unable to recover the vessel because Argentina lacks \"modern technology\" capable of \"verifying the seabed.\"It remained unclear what the next steps could be.In a statement to The Associated Press, Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said authorities would have to determine how to advance. \"We would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation, but at the moment are focused on completing imaging of the debris field,\" he said.Navy commander Jose Luis Villan urged \"prudence,\" saying that a federal judge was overseeing the investigation and would be the one to decide whether it was possible to recover a part or the entirety of the ship.Without adequate technological capabilities, Argentina would likely need to seek assistance from foreign countries or pay Ocean Infinity or another company.

Data for Lion Air's Flight 610 on aircraft tracking website FlightAware ends just a few minutes following takeoff, with the plane at an altitude of only 5,200 feet.An air transport official, Novie Riyanto, told the Associated Press the flight was cleared to return to Jakarta after the pilot made a \"return to base\" request, but the flight plunged into the sea about 10 minutes later.After a massive search effort was launched, operation director Bambang Suryo Aji told reporters that officials are not expecting to find any survivors, Sky News reported.\"My prediction is that nobody survived because the victims that we found, their bodies were no longer intact and it's been hours so it is likely 189 people have died,\" he said.There were 189 people on-board the plane, including crew.

Malindo Air, a Malaysian subsidiary of Jakarta-based Lion Air, was the first airline using the 737 Max 8 last year. The Max 8 replaced the similar 800 in the Chicago-based plane maker's product line.Boeing Co. released a statement offering its \"heartfelt sympathies\" to the passengers' \"families and loved ones.\" The Chicago-based manufacturer said it was prepared to provide technical assistance to search efforts.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8829_News_3>The crash is Indonesia's worst airline disaster since AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea in December 2014, killing all 162 on board. Indonesian airlines were barred in 2007 from flying to Europe because of safety concerns, though several were allowed to resume services in the following decade. The ban was completely lifted in June this year. The U.S. lifted a decade-long ban in 2016.On Monday, the European Commission said it had no immediate plans to ban Lion Air again, saying it will analyze the results of the investigation into the disaster.Australia's foreign affairs ministry, however, said that government officials and contractors \"have been instructed not to fly on Lion Air or their subsidiary airlines\" in the wake of the crash. \"This decision will be reviewed when the findings of the crash investigation are clear,\" the agency said in a statement.Lion Air is one of Indonesia's youngest and biggest airlines, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations.In 2013, one of its Boeing 737-800 jets missed the runway while landing on the resort island of Bali, crashing into the sea without causing any fatalities among the 108 people on board.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/indonesias-lion-air-says-its-lost-contact-with-airplane", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8829_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "In this photo released by Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) rescuers inspect debris believed to be from Lion Air passenger jet that crashed off West Java on Monday, Oct. 29, 2018.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8829_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/lionairdebris1.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this photo released by Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) a rescuer inspects debris believed to be from a Lion Air passenger jet that crashed off West Java on Monday, Oct. 29, 2018.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8829_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/lionairdebris2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Relatives of passengers comfort each other as they wait for news on a Lion Air plane that crashed off Java Island at Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang, Indonesia.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8829_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/AP18302141247253.jpg"}, {"caption": "A member of Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) inspects debris recovered from near waters where a Lion Air passenger jet crashed off, at Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta, Indonesia Monday, Oct. 29, 2018.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_8829_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/lionairdebris3.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Europe’s migration ‘fixes’ trigger disgusting humanitarian crises", "body": "<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8964_News_0>European leaders are changing their course as their efforts to curb migration have triggered what the U.N. and other groups condemn as massive humanitarian failures. Deeply divided over how and where to control Europe’s borders, leaders met Wednesday in a summit in Austria.One of Europe’s main solutions to migration — Greece’s overcrowded, unsanitary Moria migrant camp — has suicidal children and conditions that a psychiatrist compared to “an old-fashioned mental asylum.”In another heavily criticized solution to immigration, imprisoned men and women have been shuttled away from one gun battle only to end up incarcerated on the front line of another, vulnerable to both trafficking and new abuse.The jammed Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos and the dangerous migrant detention centers in Libya serve as a sober reminder that the current plans seem to be unworkable.Migrant sea arrivals to Europe have plummeted this year, but each journey now carries increasing risks of death or indefinite detention in squalid conditions. More than 1,700 people already have died on Mediterranean crossings this year.Abbas Elnaser, an Iraqi who arrived in Moria about three weeks ago, said his 8-year-old daughter’s health always had been frail, and she was deteriorating quickly in the camp that was built for 3,100, but now houses over 9,000 people.“She has problems breathing most of the time, she has problems in her lungs,” he said. “The tent is surrounded by garbage.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8964_News_1>In the central Mediterranean, Europe effectively has outsourced sea rescues of migrants to the Libyan coast guard; its boats have returned 13,000 migrants to Libyan detention centers this year. In some of those centers around the Libyan capital of Tripoli, migrants ended up on the front lines of gun battles as militias fought for control of the city.At one point in the fighting, detainees abandoned by their jailers for days broke out of at least one center but ended up caught in a gun battle. A half-dozen people were shot, according to Ibrahim Younis, head of the Libya mission for the aid group Doctors without Borders.As a Tripoli cease-fire brokered by the U.N. threatens to fracture, food for the detainees there is dwindling. Libyan officials have complained that both they and the migrants have been largely abandoned by Europe. In the Janzour detention center, around 900 people were crammed into a space intended for half that many.“We have difficulties in providing subsistence, difficulties in providing food, and difficulties in sheltering them,” said 1st Lt. Jamal Hussain. The government, which runs the facility, refused to allow an Associated Press journalist to speak to detainees.The official number of asylum-seekers and refugees in detention in Libya is around 5,000, but thousands more are believed to be captive in warehouses and other buildings, where there have been widespread reports of slavery, sexual abuse and other atrocities.This month the U.N. broke its silence over Europe’s policy of allowing the Libyan coast guard to intercept migrants, saying it was untenable and putting thousands of people at risk of being jailed indefinitely in inhumane conditions. Detailing allegations of torture, sexual abuse, violence and “nightmarish” conditions, the U.N. refugee agency said Libya didn’t remotely meet the criteria “as a place of safety.”In all, around 56,000 refugees and asylum-seekers are registered with the U.N. in Libya and neighboring Niger, which have accepted millions of euros in exchange for European promises to evaluate a portion for resettlement.But, critics say, resettlement simply isn’t happening. A total of 657 people had left for resettlement in Europe as of last week, out of 3,886 slots promised over a year ago in 11 European countries and Canada.Meanwhile, the Libyan and Greek detention centers have continued to fill, with migrants and refugees waiting a year or more for a decision in their cases. That, however, suits many anti-immigrant populists in Europe just fine.“Until the message is made abundantly clear that illegal economic migrants will not be processed, that boats will be turned back, thousands and thousands more sad and desperate lives will be lost in vain, all for your feelings of virtue,” said Nathan Gill, a British member of the European parliament, accusing fellow legislators last week of being soft on immigration. “You’re not really helping people.”If migrants have made it to the Greek island of Lesbos, they’re already one step ahead of those trapped in Libya. But conditions are hardly better. Raw sewage flows out the main entrance in Moria, garbage piles up outside the containers where migrants sleep.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8964_News_2>Luca Fontana, who works for Doctors without Borders in Lesbos, said a quarter of the minors there had either attempted suicide, had suicidal thoughts or were harming themselves.“Only last week had to suture the wrists of a couple of unaccompanied minors, they tried to cut their veins inside Moria camp,” he said.Psychiatrist Alessandro Barbero of Doctors without Borders said Moria was as grim as “an old-fashioned mental asylum, not seen in parts of Europe since the mid-twentieth century.”Any hope of an easy solution to Europe’s immigration dilemma has faded.Paolo Campana, who has studied the smuggling networks that lead through Libya, has said a solution is possible only if legal migration into Europe opens up at the same time as peace, stability and prosperity emerge in violence-plagued nations like Iraq, Syria, Ethiopia and Eritrea.“We need to be humanitarian and to be pragmatic,” he said.As of last week, 73,696 migrants and refugees have entered Europe by sea this year along with over 11,000 land arrivals, compared with 128,993 sea arrivals in 2017 and 298,663 in 2016.European leaders in June proposed creating centers to process migrants in North Africa but those governments quickly rejected the idea. The EU now is pitching plans of an upgraded border force.Last week, Austria and Italy’s right-wing interior ministers called for shipboard screenings of migrants on the Mediterranean, raising new questions about whose ships and where — given that Italy has blocked humanitarian groups from docking with migrants rescued at sea, favoring Libyan boats instead.Riccardo Magi, an Italian lawmaker from the tiny left-wing +Europa party, said Libya’s deteriorating crisis has risked sending migrants and refugees on ever smaller boats into greater danger.“What is sure is that the departures will continue and that deaths will continue to occur and that there will be fewer and fewer eyes” on the sea to rescue those in need, Magi said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_8964_News_3>Two survivors of a deadly wreck who were picked up by the coast guard later were imprisoned and tortured, said Giorgia Linardi, a spokeswoman for the SeaWatch rescue boat.

{"title": "Burma's Karen refugees face dwindling aid, struggle with depression and suicides", "body": "More than 100,000 mostly ethnic Karen refugees from Burma - many Christians among them - are crammed into nine camps set out in isolated, misty hills of jungle terrain inside the border of Thailand.The camps, which have been here for generations, are now rife with depression, substance abuse, and suicide - a taboo topic in Karen culture. Loved ones often refuse to discuss suicides, out of fear it will afflict another family member.Yet the hushed-away problem figures only to worsen as camp conditions deteriorate, and donations from an international community that hears much more these days about persecuted Muslims in another Burmese minority group, the Rohingya, begin to dry up.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_0>“There is an increased pressure on people as a result of the reductions (in aid),” said Hayso Thako, an education coordinator for the camps. “For the older people, they have been here so long they have lost hope of a better life. And for the young people who take their lives, there is no hope that they can see.”Three years after their joint suicide, the legacy of two such youth still haunts the Karen.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_1>In March, 2015, Kyawsay and his girlfriend, Nawehkohloh, were teenagers in love. Members of the long-persecuted Burmese Karen minority, they were both born in the Mae La Oon refugee camp along the Burma-Thailand border. They knew nothing – and had never seen so much as a glimpse – of the world outside.Ensnared by family conflicts, a lack of opportunity and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, the young lovers hung themselves side-by-side in a school classroom inside the camp grounds one afternoon.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_2>The tragic double-suicide rocked the refugee community. But it would not be first – nor the last – incidence of a refugee taking their life in what has become a growing problem.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_3>According to official data provided to Fox News, since 2015 some 60 refugees between the ages of 12 and 72 have committed suicide. Another 23 have attempted it.It's not hard to understand why.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_4>Established nearly 35 years ago, a faded “temporary” sign still adorns the entrance of the Mae La camp, the largest of the nine camps, and “home” to almost 40,000 Karen. Thousands of children were born and raised in the camps, then went on to have children of their own.That's produced multiple generations who have not been allowed to set foot beyond the barbed-wire barricades, as per Thai government regulations.Visitors are also typically not permitted to enter the deeply secluded grounds. The refugees are considered stateless, and without a country to call their own, are generally forbidden from gaining Thai citizenship. They are also unable or unwilling to register as Burmese citizens, or obtain documentation from abroad.That leaves the refugees with few options, though some do their best to pass the time.Despite losing limbs and their eyesight to landmines, a group of Christian men being cared for in a small cement shelter have learned to weave and bead – making delicate hearts and crosses, keychains and jewels, which they sell for a few pennies to passers-by.“<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_5>Jesus is our hope, our life,” the men sing in their native tongue, having formed their own gospel choir to pass the dark days and nights.The camps frequently experience devastating flash floods in the wet season, which have claimed the lives of dozens of refugees - and obliterated fragile homes built with bamboo and banana leaves.Worse, in recent years Karen refugees have seen their already limited monthly rations of rice, yellow split peas, fortified flour and fish paste fall by almost half. That figure is expected to drop even further in the coming months – worsening the already acute rate of malnutrition in the camp, according to the Mae La camp's top official, who goes only by the first name of Honest.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_6>He lamented that the drop in donor funding has have also meant Karens working in the camp – including teachers – have been reduced to taking a skeletal salary, with even that expected to dissipate come November. By next year, the higher education programs will have been cut from the budget too.“Most have no opportunity to even make a small income for their family, they aren’t allowed to go outside to work,” continued Honest. “The international community likely thinks the situation in Burma is changing, that it is becoming peaceful and the Karen people can go home. But we cannot. There is still a lot of armed conflict, it is not safe. And even if the Burmese government says they are negotiating for our return, it is the Army in charge. At any time, the violence can start all over again.”International donors have steadily bowed out in recent years, following Burmese government claims that it has achieved peace with the Karen. The aid money and attention was siphoned off by other international crises and, more recently, to the plight of the mostly Muslim Rohingya.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_7>But despite the signing of a peace agreement in 2015 between the government and armed Karen groups, critics contend the apparent accord is superficial, and tensions below the surface are still boiling.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_8>For many, the notion of going home is fraught with even more fear and pain.Mary, a 44-year-old widowed mother of two boys – aged seven and 11 – fled the intense fighting in Burma after the Army set fire to her village just over 11 years ago. Her mother died along the road to the Thai border, and since that day Mary has shut off all memory of life before being rendered a refugee.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_9><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_10>“I’m afraid to go back. I cannot go back,” she explained. “We lost everything – there is no work, no land for us anymore. I do not remember anything from there anymore. I had to lose everything when I left.”In addition to property, food, job and security concerns should they return to Burma, Karen refugees are also concerned about the inherent threat of landmines, unexploded ordnance and other remnants of war.An International Rescue Committee (IRC)’s hospital – the only one on the expansive grounds – is filled to overflowing with patients. There is a shortage of trained medical staff, which is grapplles with outbreaks of dengue fever – spread by mosquito bites - which has already affected more than 100 children.With immediate medical needs a top priority, the notion of adequate psychological assistance is a far away pipe dream.Rev. Robert Htwa, one of the original camp founders and missionaries tending to the Karen, said some camps offer basic rehabilitation and counseling. But he stressed the funding cuts have meant only a small portion of those in need are able to receive even the most rudimentary help.Depression, which is said to afflict around half the adults in the camp system, has brought with it drug addiction, and higher numbers of children are at risk of malnutrition and neglect.Pregnant and post-partum women, too, are said to be among the highest portion of the refugee population suffering from depression and mental illness.For now, life lingers in a forsaken limbo and the sense of sorrow is palpable.“We don’t know what will happen,” Rev. Htwa added. “There is nowhere to go.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/burmas-karen-refugees-face-dwindling-aid-struggle-with-depression-and-suicides", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A church for the Burmese Karen Christians on the grounds of the world's largest refugee camp, Mae La in Thailand.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/776ebe73-th4.jpg"}, {"caption": "Two teenage Karen refugees take their own lives, signaling an uptick of suicides amid the bleak situation.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/7638aa6d-th11.jpg"}, {"caption": "Options are limited for the Karen people, many of who have spent their entire lives confined to the camp grounds.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/4e7edce5-th5.jpg"}, {"caption": "Depression among the refugee population is especially high among pregnant and post-partum mothers.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/33dea417-th10.jpg"}, {"caption": "Frequent flash flooding during monsoon season is known to destroy what little livelihoods the Karen Burmese have in the refugee camps.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/d612085c-th3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Honest (left) with other leaders of the Mae La camp lament the sharp reductions in funding that have occurred in recent years.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/th2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Mary's children were born into the refugee camp and she fears they will never see the outside world.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_6", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/th7.jpg"}, {"caption": "Victims of landmines rely on their faith, and sing the gospel, to pass the day.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_7", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/th8.jpg"}, {"caption": "Despite have lost limbs and their eyesight, Karen refugees make jewels and trinkets in the hopes of earning some spare change.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9261_News_8", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/th6.jpg"}, {"caption": "Pastor Rev.

The service had also received dozens of calls reporting missing persons, but it was unclear if some of them were among those found dead, a spokesperson told Reuters.The two largest wildfires — one 20 miles northeast of Athens near Rafina, the other 30 miles west of the capital in Kineta — broke out Monday during hot, dry summer conditions.The speed with which the blaze, located northeast of Athens, spread took many by surprise, with survivors describing people fleeing to beaches and swimming out to sea despite high waves, desperately trying to escape thick smoke and flaming pine cones raining down into the water.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9325_News_0>\"We couldn't see any fire.

{"title": "Thai youth soccer team leaves hospital, shares details of harrowing ordeal in cave", "body": "The members of a Thai youth soccer team whose gripping rescue from a flooded cavern captivated the globe left a hospital Wednesday and shared details of their harrowing two-week ordeal for the first time.The news conference, held in a government building in the northern city of Chiang Rai, was the first opportunity the 12 boys and their 25-year-old coach had to speak directly to the media, though video of the group was released previously. Officials pre-screened questions to weed out any they felt may be psychologically damaging.A conference hall prepared for the interview was decorated to look like a soccer field, and the event started with a tribute to diver and former Navy SEAL Saman Kunan, who was the lone death to occur during the rescue effort.On entering the interview room, one of the boys could be heard saying, “everyone was worried about us and I’m speechless,\" according to Sky News.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9339_News_0>Another boy said his \"heart burst\" when the first diver popped up, and a teammate told reporters he was \"shocked\" when one of the divers turned out to be British.\"I said 'Hello,'\" the boy said. \"It's just a miracle that happened. I was frightened. I said, 'Can I help you?'\"The Wild Boars team members, most of whom were not identified during Wednesday's interview, left soccer practice with their coach and entered the Tham Luang cave June 23 -- just before heavy rains flooded the caverns and cut off their way out.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9339_News_1>The team's coach, \"Ake\" Ekkapol Janthawong, said he was the only member of the group who had previously been to the cave.\"The cave was deep and it was long,\" he told reporters. \"We saw the water but it wasn't deep.\"Ekkapol said he asked the boys if they wanted to explore, and told them they would have to swim. The team said they could all swim, and decided to go in. Ekkapol later told reporters he will \"think twice\" before he does anything similar in the future.One of the boys said he was afraid during the ordeal he would be \"scolded\" by his mother after she found out the team was trapped.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9339_News_2>\"I was afraid I wouldn't go home,\" he said.The boys said they took turns digging a cave wall, alternating shifts to find clear drinking water after they felt water coming from the walls inside the cavern.After a 10 day search, divers found the group huddling on a spot of dry ground deep inside the cave. An international team of rescuers using diving equipment and pulleys were then able to extract the 12 boys and coach through a lengthy process that included traversing tight, flooded passageways. It took three days to get everyone to safety.One of the boys hailed a rescuer as being \"like a father.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9339_News_3>\"He called me son,\" the boy said.Divers involved in the rescue recently revealed each of the children were sedated to stop them from panicking during the rescue. The move was controversial enough that the Australian Government negotiated immunity from Thai authorities for any Australians involved in the sedation of the children in case anything went wrong, according to News.com.au.Though one of the boys said during the news conference, “I was really afraid I would not be able to return home,\" the team said their coach was an inspirational leader, telling them to fight fear and not give in.The boys said they were able to watch Sunday's World Cup final from the hospital, and most of the boys said they were rooting for France, which emerged the victor.The Wild Boars and their coach had been pronounced generally healthy by doctors, aside from minor infections. One doctor who treated the boys said each gained about six pounds of weight since their rescue.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9339_News_4>\"They are physically and emotionally well,\" she said.Several of the boys took the opportunity of the interview to apologize to their parents, saying they were sorry they did not inform them they were going into the cave.\"I want to apologize to my mother,\" one boy said. \"I didn't tell her the truth as I said I was only going to [soccer practice].\"Another player feared his parents were searching the wrong cavern for him, because he accidentally told them he was going to a different cave.\"I like to say sorry to my parents, 'cause I told them the wrong cave...they were probably searching every cave for me,\" he said.The family of one boy was preparing for his return Wednesday night. Banphot Konkum, an uncle who has raised 13-year-old Duangpetch Promthep, told the Associated Press he'll have a renovated bedroom and gifts awaiting him.\"We'll do whatever he wants.

{"title": "Former navy SEAL assisting in cave rescue of Thai soccer team dead from lack of oxygen, authorities say", "body": "A former Thai navy SEAL assisting in the rescue of a youth soccer team and coach trapped deep inside a partially flooded cave complex died early Friday morning from a lack of oxygen -- even as another volunteer suggested a daring attempt to free the group could take place \"today or tomorrow.\"Officials warned the window of opportunity to save the 12 boys and their coach is “limited,” and the diver’s death raises serious question marks about a proposed rescue route that would bring the stranded squad out through the waterlogged passageways of the Tham Luang cave.The deceased volunteer rescuer, identified as Saman Kunan, 38, was returning at about 1 a.m. from the chamber where the boys are trapped when he ran out of oxygen, passed out and died. Kunan had left the SEALs in 2006 to work at Bangkok’s airport as an emergency rescue officer.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_0>For the cave rescue, he was part of a team trying to establish an air line to the chamber where the children and their coach are holed up. Kunan's body will be flown to his hometown of Roi Et for a royally-sponsored funereal, the king of Thailand announced.In video that's emerged of Kunan waiting to board a plane to join the rescue mission, he vows to save the trapped group.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_1>\"I'm accompanied by doctors from the navy and divers from SeaWorld that also donated lots of diving equipment,\" Kunan said, according to a translation. \"See you this evening. We will bring the kids home.\"His SEAL unit paid tribute to him, saying: “He was an athlete. He loved adventure sports…no matter what activity the frogs took part in Saman would join, until the end of his life.”Thailand’s Navy SEAL commander, Apakorn Yookongkaew, said on Friday oxygen levels in the shelter have dropped, but a doctor is currently with the boys to monitor their health.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_2>Authorities revealed oxygen levels have dropped to 15 percent – the usual level is 21 percent – as hundreds of rescue workers have depleted the supply in the cave.Yookongkaew also indicated rescuers might have no choice but to attempt a potentially dangerous extraction of the group, which may force the team and coach to strap on diving equipment despite most of them being unable to swim. The other option would be to wait out the rainy season -- which typically ends in October -- inside the cave.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_3>“At first, we thought the children could stay for a long time…but now things have changed, we have a limited time,” he said.Volunteer diver Ivan Karadzic told Sky News the \"mood has changed\" after Saman's death and he expected a rescue mission to happen \"today or tomorrow\"Karadzic vowed the rescue attempt would continue despite the death of the diver.“We lost one man, but we still have faith to carry out our work,\" he said.Deputy army commander Chalongchai Chaiyakham said the priority was to fill the air inside the chamber. Divers have released 30 tanks of air to try to restore the cave's oxygen to healthy levels.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_4>“We’ve got to finish laying the air pipe today…With the air filled, the kids could stay for months,\" Chaiyakham said.Alternative rescue scenarios have ramped up as forecasts for rain make the extraction-by-diving plan increasingly precarious.Engineers are working with the army to explore an area which they believe is the back end of the cave, chiseling away limestone rocks which could be just hundreds of meters from where the boys are trapped.“Originally we were exploring it as a way to bring supplies to the children from the back end of the cave, but now it could become more,” Thanes Weerasiri, president of the Engineering Institute of Thailand, told Reuters.Up to 200 people are exploring the hill to try to find a workable shaft.Billionaire Elon Musk has also said that engineers from his firms – SpaceX and The Boring Company – are heading to Thailand to see if they can assist.Musk says his companies have “advance ground penetrating radar” that is “pretty good at digging holes” and technology that could “create an air tunnel underwater.”The soccer team, ages 11-16, entered the Tham Luang cave complex in Chiang Rai province on June 23 with their 25-year-old soccer coach, just after practice ended. The boys were reportedly taking part in some sort of \"initiation” ritual, in which they would carve their names on the cave wall.Meanwhile, should the boys be extracted in time and be healthy enough to travel, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has invited them to the World Cup final in Russia.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/former-navy-seal-assisting-in-cave-rescue-of-thai-soccer-team-dead-from-lack-of-oxygen-authorities-say", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The volunteer rescuer, identified as Saman Kunan, 38, passed out after running out of oxygen and died while returning from the chamber around 1am local time where the group of boys are trapped", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Saman20Kunan.jpg"}, {"caption": "The body of Saman Gunan, a former Thai navy SEAL who died during an overnight mission, is carried during a repatriation and religious rites ceremony at Chiang Rai Airport in Mae Sai", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18187309497060.jpg"}, {"caption": "Soldiers carry a pump to help drain the rising flood water in a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18187222214103.jpg"}, {"caption": "Thai rescuers prepare to enter the cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18187142604441.jpg"}, {"caption": "Concerned family members walk and wait near the cave where the boys are trapped", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9371_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18187140918513.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Thailand cave rescue clears hurdle, divers reach passageway that may lead to youth soccer team", "body": "The rescue efforts to reach 12 boys and their soccer coach who went missing a week ago in a cave in Thailand reached a milestone on Sunday when divers were able to finally reach a passageway that could lead them to the team.Divers have been searching the Tham Luang cave complex in Chiang Rai province in northern part of the country since last Saturday, after the group entered the cave after soccer practice and became trapped by muddy floodwaters spawned by heavy rains and have not been heard from since.A team led by Thai Navy SEAL divers pushed through the murk of a half-mile-long chamber to a passageway that could lead to where the missing possibly took shelter, the SEAL's commander, Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew, told the Associated Press on Sunday.\"It's still tough as the water stream is quite strong,\" he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9385_News_0>Over the past week, heavy rain has hampered search and rescue efforts, causing flooding which has stopped rescuers getting through chambers to get deeper into the cave.On Saturday, the rain began to finally ease, allowing divers to finally start making progress through the murky water-filled passageways.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9385_News_1>\"Water has receded considerably and we are pumping out water in all chambers (near the entrance),\" Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters, according to Sky News.Besides bicycles and football boots left near the cave's entrance and hand prints seen on the walls, there has been no contact with the boys, ages 11 to 16, or their 25-year-old assistant coach. Rescuers believe there is still a chance the group could survive.Dr. Somsak Akkasilp, director-general of the Medical Services Department, told Reuters the group’s survival depended on whether they found fresh drinking water, but he was concerned about the risk of infection from unclean water, or contact with some animal inside the cave.“They should be okay without food for eight days,” he said.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9385_News_2>Search crews, including a U.S. military team, have been  combing the mountainside looking for fissure that might lead to shafts that might serve as a back door to the blocked-off areas where the missing may be sheltering.Several have been found and explorers have been able to descend into some, but so far it is not clear whether they lead to anywhere useful.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9385_News_3>\"We surveyed all areas and there were reported to be about 20, and out of that there are about 10 with the possibility of having shafts,\" Osatanakorn told reporters Sunday. \"But at the moment, we have narrowed it down to two. Today we are working inside those two shafts.\"The divers' goal is to get to an area of the cave known as Pattaya Beach, a section of the cave has a higher elevation which authorities hope remained dry and the 13 missing took shelter there.The search has been going slowly, largely because flooding has blocked rescuers from going through chambers to get deeper into the cave. Pumping water out of the cave hasn't solved the problem, so other teams have been looking to divert groundwater.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9385_News_4>The cave complex extends several miles and has wide chambers and narrow passageways with rocky outcrops and changes in elevation.

{"title": "Thai youth soccer team could have to dive out of caves or wait months to be rescued", "body": "Rescue workers in Thailand who successfully located the 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a cave for 10 days are now racing against time to get them out before water levels rise.Rescuers had earlier suggested that they would wait for water levels to drop, which could take until October, but heavy rains forecast for later this week could flood the cave even further, meaning the boys, ages 11-16, face the prospect of having to move quicker than anticipated.Teams have been pumping about 2,600 gallons (10,000 liters) of water out of the caves every hour, but have so far only been able to lower the level by 1 centimeter. Water in the cave is about knee-deep but is neck-deep in the chamber, according to the Thai English-language website Khaosodenglish.com.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9383_News_0>Anupong Paojinda, the Thai interior minister, has said that the boys might have to learn to dive in order to escape the tunnels, which are so narrow in parts that only one body can pass through at a time. None of the boys knows how to swim and even elite Thai Navy SEAL divers have been finding the ability to navigate through muddy waters difficult.“As rain is forecast in the next few days, the evacuation must speed up. Diving gear will be used,” he told the Bangkok Post. “If the water rises, the task will be difficult. We must bring the kids out before then.“Diving is not easy. Those who have never done it will find it difficult, because there are narrow passages in the cave. They must be able to use diving gear. If the gear is lost at any moment, it can be dangerous to life.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9383_News_1>Anmar Mirza, national coordinator of the National Cave Rescue Commission in the U.S. and editor of the book Manual of U.S. Cave Rescue Technique, told the AP that “trying to take non-divers through caves is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy.”The boys must be safely extracted from nearly a mile of tunnels, most of which are underwater. They could use the same narrow passages out that their rescuers found, but such a task is very dangerous for a novice.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9383_News_2>Another option is for rescuers to drill into the chamber and airlift them out. The British Cave Rescue Council, which has members taking part in the rescue operation, estimates that the group are around 1.2 miles into the cave and around 0.6 miles below the surface. But other estimates put the boys as far as 2.5 miles into the caves. An airlift plan would be difficult because the cave stretches under a mountainside for up to 6 miles and varies in elevation.The final rescue plan will be made by Thai authorities, who say they are committed to “100 percent safety.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9383_News_3><IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9383_News_4>“We worked so hard to find them and we will not lose them,” said Chiang Rai provincial Governor Narongsak Osatanakorn.The team entered the Tham Luang cave complex in Chiang Rai province, located in the northern part of the country on June 23 after soccer practice, but became trapped when heavy rains flooded key passages.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9383_News_5>British divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, described as the “A Team” of rescuers, according to The Daily Mail, located the boys 10 days after they went missing, about 300-400 yards past a section of the cave that was on higher ground and was thought to be where the team members and their coach may have taken shelter, Thai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said.They were able to lay a guideline down so that others could follow them and help deliver essential supplies to the group.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9383_News_6>When a boy from the team asked when they can exit the cave, a rescuer responded “Not today.

Most of the injured were in Osaka — Japan's No. 2 city bustling with businesses. Osaka officials did not give details, but the injuries reported in Kyoto and three other neighboring prefectures were all minor.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9409_News_1>The magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck shortly after 8 a.m. north of Osaka at a depth of about 13 kilometers (8 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The strongest shaking was north of Osaka, but the quake rattled large parts of western Japan, including Kyoto, the agency said.The temblor reminded many of the magnitude 7.3 Hanshin-Kobe quake in 1995 that killed more than 6,000 people in the region. Monday's quake also followed a series of smaller quakes near Tokyo in recent weeks.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9409_News_2>\"It was not as bad as the Kobe quake,\" said Jun Kawanami, a 30-year-old lawyer in Osaka. He said his wife ducked under a table and elevators in his office building were out of operation. \"I used the stairs but I was out of breath by the time I arrived at my office on the 22nd floor,\" he said.The 9-year-old girl, Rina Miyake, was found at a school, local media reported. A falling concrete wall knocked down and killed her as she walked at her elementary school in Takatsuki.NHK public television aired video showing the collapsed upper half of the high wall, which was painted cheerfully with trees, flowers and blue sky and surrounded the school swimming pool.Takatsuki Mayor Takeshi Hamada apologized over her death because of the wall's collapse. The structure was old and made of concrete blocks — a known risk in earthquakes.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga ordered the Education Ministry to conduct nationwide safety checks of concrete block structures at public schools.More than 1,000 schools were closed in Osaka and nearby prefectures, Kyodo News reported. Wall cracks and other minor damage were found at several schools.Dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway service in the Osaka area including the bullet train were suspended to check for damage. Passengers exited trains on the tracks between stations.Some subway service resumed in the afternoon, but train stations remained crowded with passengers waiting for trains to restart, many of them sitting on the floor. Long lines of people waited to board bullet trains as they resumed operation.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9409_News_3>The quake knocked over walls, broke windows and set off scattered building fires. It toppled bookcases in homes and scattered goods on shop floors. It also cracked roads and broke water pipes, leaving homes without water.Due to damage to underground gas lines, 110,000 homes in Takatsuki and Ibaraki cities were without gas, and repairs are expected to take as long as two weeks, according to Osaka Gas Co.More building damage was found in the afternoon as disaster and relief workers inspected and cleaned up the affected areas. Roofs and roof tiles at homes and at least one temple fell to the ground in Osaka. At a shrine in Kyoto, stone lanterns broke and collapsed to the ground.Defense troops joined rescue and relief operations in parts of Osaka, along with special vehicles to deliver clean drinking water.About 850 people took shelter at community centers, school gymnasiums and other public facilities in Osaka.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/japan-earthquake-kills-3-including-9-year-old-girl-scores-injured", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9409_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Damage inside a home in Osaka, Japan, after the earthquake struck.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9409_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Earthquake20Osaka.jpg"}, {"caption": "After Monday's earthquake, more than 1,000 schools were closed in Osaka and nearby prefectures, Kyodo News reported.

It is expected to make landfall early Saturday near Salalah, Oman's third-largest city and home to some 200,000 people close to the country's border with war-ravaged Yemen, according to the Associated Press.Omani forecasters warned Salalah and the surrounding area would get at least 7.87 inches of rain, over twice the amount of rain this city typically gets in a year.India's Meteorological Department said the storm packed maximum sustained winds of 99-106 miles per hour, with gusts of up to 118 mph.\"Salalah is expected to experience maximum wind and maximum rainfall and also the maximum storm surge,\" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra of the department.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9464_News_1>Already at least 40 people, including Yemenis, Indians and Sudanese, were reported missing on Socotra, where flash floods washed away animals and cut power lines on the isle in the Arabian Sea. Officials feared some may be dead.Conditions quickly deteriorated in Salalah after sunrise Friday, with winds and rain beginning to pick up. Strong waves smashed into empty tourist beaches. Many holidaymakers fled the storm Thursday night before Salalah International Airport closed. The Port of Salalah — a key gateway for the country — also closed, its cranes secured against the pounding rain.Streets quickly emptied across the city. Standing water covered roads and caused at least one car to hydroplane and flip over.Later, a municipal worker on a massive loader used its bucket to tear into a road median to drain a flooded street, showing how desperate the situation could become.Authorities remained worried about flash flooding in the area's valleys and potential mudslides down its nearby cloud-shrouded mountains.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9464_News_2>A sizable police presence has already fanned out across Salalah, the hometown of Oman's longtime ruler Sultan Qaboos bin Said.\"Of course, for the citizen there is going to be a sense of fear of the consequences that can happen,\" said Brig. Gen. Mohsin bin Ahmed al-Abri, the commander of Dhofar governorate's police. \"We have been through a few similar cases and there were losses in properties and also in human life as well. But one has to take precautions and work on that basis.\"As torrential rains poured down, local authorities opened schools to shelter those whose homes are at risk. About 600 people, mostly laborers, huddled at the West Salalah School, some sleeping on mattresses on the floors of classrooms, where math and English lesson posters hung on the walls.Shahid Kazmi, a worker from Pakistan's Kashmir region, told The Associated Press that police moved him and others to the school. He acknowledged being a bit scared of the storm but said: \"Inshallah, we are safe here.\"On Socotra, authorities relocated over 230 families to sturdier buildings and other areas, including those more inland and in the island's mountains, Yemeni security officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.Flash floods engulfed Socotra streets, cutting electricity and communication lines, they said. At least 40 people were missing, they added. Some humanitarian aid from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates arrived on the island just hours after the cyclone receded.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9464_News_3>The officials said heavy rains pummeled Yemen's easternmost province of al-Mahra, along the nation's border with Oman.Socotra Gov. Ramzy Mahrous said one ship sank and two others ran aground in the storm, initially saying authorities believed 17 people were missing.\"We consider them dead,\" the governor said.Yemen's self-exiled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi issued a statement ordering troops under his command on the island to help citizens, deliver supplies and reopen roads.The island, listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, has been the focus of a dispute between the UAE and Yemen's internationally recognized government amid that country's war after Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, seized the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9464_News_4>Socotra has a unique ecosystem and is home to rare plants, snails and reptiles that can be found nowhere else on the planet.

{"title": "National Hurricane Center gives sneak peek of newly improved technology", "body": "The National Hurricane Center is using newly improved technology to warn of major storms as the country braces for another active hurricane season set to begin June 1.“As technology changes and people are getting their information in different ways, it’s now time for the hurricane center to really look and see how effective our products are and look toward the future,” said Dan Brown, a senior hurricane specialist for the center who added that more sophisticated satellites, better track forecasting and improved computer codes have all contributed to the life-saving improvements.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is working with the Miami-based center to use data collected by planes, buoys and satellites to shrink the dreaded cone of uncertainty and extend advisories, warnings and watches to 72 hours before a storm, adding a whole additional day for storm preparations.Experimental graphics used last year to depict arrival times for dangerous weather conditions will also become a permanent addition to forecasts.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_0>“When we create that cone of uncertainty, we’re using the past five years of errors to carve out that cone and as the track keeps getting better, the cone keeps getting smaller and smaller,” Brown said. “A smaller cone means less evacuations by narrowing the amount of land it covers.”While the forecast cone is the most-viewed tool on the NHC’s website, it’s highly debated because the public has been known to only react to warnings along the center track, ignoring up to hundreds of miles of hazardous weather warnings on each side of the center line.Brown said it’s important that people remember that the cone only provides an accurate probable track two thirds of the time.“Last year, our track forecasts of where the hurricane is going to go were the best historically that we’ve ever achieved,” said Jamie Rhome, the leader of the Storm Surge Unit at the hurricane center. “We’re taking the same technology that is in your hands to run more simulations and dig deeper into the physics of a hurricane.”In 2017, the center launched a new satellite to warn of storm systems that had not even formed yet.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_1>“We issued those for seven different systems in the Atlantic, six of those went on to become tropical storms or hurricanes, giving emergency responders and the public some additional time before those hazards arrived,” said Brown.Another groundbreaking release included the Storm Surge Watch and Warning Graphic to clearly depict locations that may be affected by a storm surge, an abnormal rise of water that is historically the greatest threat to life and property from a hurricane, according to NOAA.“What surprised us last year is how few people lost their lives in storm surge,” said Rhome, who added that nearly 90 percent of hurricane-related deaths are caused by water, while 8 percent are a result of severe wind. “Storm surge took 41 people in Superstorm Sandy, yet in all the landfalls we had in 2017, nobody died from a storm surge.”The improvements follow a record-breaking year for hurricanes.“When I look back at the 2017 season, some of the surprising things and challenges we had…it’s just staggering,” said NHC Director Ken Graham.After tearing through the Caribbean with Category 5-force winds last September, Hurricane Irma’s reach at one point covered the entire state of Florida, causing the largest evacuation in the state’s history.Irma’s 185 mph maximum sustained winds lasted for 37 hours, the longest a tropical cyclone maintained winds that strong. The hurricane also became the strongest storm in the Atlantic, outside of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_2>The NHC is committed to constant progress in its Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project, which was launched to advance intensity and track forecasting for rapidly intensifying storms like Irma.“The biggest push for us over next few years is improving the lead time we can give to emergency managers so that they can call emergency evacuations, if necessary,” added Rhome.The forecasting leader also receives help from the U.S. Air Force’s “Hurricane Hunters,” who fly one of only 12 planes in the world built to withstand the severe weather, directly into the eye of a storm for 24 hours a day, each day until it makes landfall.The center has announced a plan to work with behavioral scientists to make sure warnings are simple enough to understand so that the public will act on them in the future.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_3>“To tell somebody ‘that is water up your pant leg’…to make it that simple and understood is critical,” said Graham. “All the science in the world can be perfect but if it’s not understood, then it doesn’t do any good.”NOAA plans to release their official outlook for the 2018 hurricane season on May 24.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//tech/national-hurricane-center-gives-sneak-peek-of-newly-improved-technology", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "The World Meteorological Organization announced the names for this year’s tropical storms and hurricanes in April.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/raffahurricanenames.png"}, {"caption": "\"We’ve made a lot of improvements in track forecasting...but we still have a long way to go,\" said NHC Hurricane Specialist Dan Brown.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/raffanhccomputers.png"}, {"caption": "“Going through the eye wall is like being on a wooden roller coaster for eight hours...you’re shaking and bouncing around, but you still have to focus and do your work to gather data and accomplish the mission,\" said NOAA Aerospace Engineer Nick Underwood.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/raffaplaneview.png"}, {"caption": "NOAA uses a high-altitude Gulfstream jet to launch up to 30 dropsondes, an expendable weather radar device about the size of the cardboard paper towel roll that falls into the ocean after recording weather data.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9486_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/raffadrosondefull.png"}]}

{"title": "7 hurricane-proof vacation destinations", "body": "Hurricane season is upon us, and weather experts are predicting that 2013 is going to be a doozy. But even if you can’t stop extreme weather from happening, at least you can protect yourself on your vacation — provided you pick a vacation destination that is reliably hurricane-free. Here are some top-notch options, as well as great places to stay while you’re there.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_0>Though Lake Tahoe may sometimes get serious snowstorms, the cold waters along the California coast mean that hurricanes almost never make landfall in the state (only two have hit in the last 100 years). When they do hit, it’s typically Southern California that is most affected instead. Lake Tahoe safely sits in northern California, where it has 300 days of sun a year and plenty of great year-round vacation activities — swimming, boating, and hiking in the summer, and skiing in the winter.This cluster of cabins right on the lake makes a great value pick. While some rooms are tucked across the street from the lake in a darker, tree-covered area, the lakefront cottages have excellent views and open to the sandy beach and a private pier where guests can swim and play in privacy. Kitchenettes make dining in (and saving money) easy. And the heated outdoor pool (open seasonally) is said to be the largest in North Lake Tahoe.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_1>Though France’s western coast does get storms, no true hurricanes have hit France in recorded history — and Paris, being an inland city, is hurricane-free. The City of Light is world-famous for its romantic ambiance, museums, and charming cafes.The Hidden Hotel — as its name suggests — is tucked away on a quaint side street, and is within walking distance to L’Arc de Triomphe and the Charles de Gualle metro station. The intimate hotel has only 23 rooms, and incorporates handmade craftsmanship and natural materials that give it a contemporary and Zen-like vibe.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_2>Las Vegas may get high desert temperatures and occasional thunderstorms, but it is not prone to hurricanes. You can gamble as much money as you want here, but you won’t have to gamble on Mother Nature sending a hurricane to ruin your stay.A new breed of Las Vegas luxury, with 392 elegant rooms and some of Vegas’ best service, the Mandarin Oriental is a quiet haven on the glitzy Strip. The hotel lacks the characteristic excess that many people come to Vegas for (including a casino), opting instead for a more restrained approach: a beautiful spa, two fine dining restaurants, a peaceful pool, meeting space, and the rarest of Las Vegas features — serenity. But the convenient City Center location means easy access to all the excess you want.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_3>Spain may have been hit with a tropical depression back in 2005, but has not been hit with a true hurricane since 1842. And since Madrid is inland, it is at lesser risk for damage when the rare hurricane does threaten landfall. Madrid is a vibrant multicultural city with world-class museums, charming cobblestone streets lined with centuries-old buildings, wonderful tapas bars, and hopping nightlife.Hotel Ada Palace’s spacious rooms are elegant (pale yellow striped walls, blue and white toile bedspreads), and have flat-screen TVs, minibars, and hydro massage showers. Additional highlights here include a wonderful (and expensive) restaurant with gorgeous views of the surrounding buildings, and a stylish rooftop lounge.This beautiful Canadian island has never been hit with a hurricane. (Though it did get hit with the remnants of Typhoon Freda in 1962, which had died down to an extratropical storm by the time in hit land, and on rare occasions strong windstorms can knock out power here). Vancouver Island is home to a few great golf courses, dozens of ecological reserves, several surprisingly good wineries, and some quaint towns including lovely Victoria, the capital of British Columbia.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_4>A highly acclaimed wine cellar, an excellent restaurant and sushi bar, a great spa with couple’s treatments, and warm decor throughout make this hotel an excellent pick for an upscale romantic getaway. Spacious rooms have large furnished balconies with ocean views, upscale peek-a-boo bathrooms with deep whirlpool tubs and Deserving Thyme toiletries, and sitting areas with working fireplaces.This place is a sure bet: Hurricanes just don’t make it this far inland, folks. This gorgeous skiing destination has incredible slopes, but it’s also lovely in the summertime, with its unspoiled mountain scenery and proximity to Grand Teton National Park. (It’s also about a two-hour drive from Yellowstone.)<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_5>Set in a wildlife refuge more than 700 feet above the Jackson Valley, the Spring Creek Ranch has arguably the most stunning views of the Tetons in the area. It has a wide array of room categories, from standard hotel rooms to immense two-bedroom condos, but the quality and design of each unit varies greatly, making it a game of hit-or-miss.As we mentioned with Lake Tahoe, northern California is not typically at risk for hurricanes, particularly inland. So head to Napa for relaxing wine tasting, spa treatments, and hot air balloon rides — it’s extremely unlikely that a tropical storm will interfere with your dose of California sunshine.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_6>The gorgeous Calistoga Ranch draws A-list celebrities and other notables with its stunning setting on a private, wooded 157-acre park, equipped with hiking trails, yoga, an outdoor pool, and luxury spa. On-site wine-tasting seminars mean that guests don’t even have to venture off the property to experience the region’s famous vintages.Post-Sandy Caribbean RundownActive travel infoHoliday travel info", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//travel/7-hurricane-proof-vacation-destinations", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Franciscan-Lakeside-Lodge.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Pariswtwt6.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Las-Vegasawefwtwrtw5w.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Madridsfgsgsg.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Vancouverdfhdfhdbd.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Jackson-Holexdfhdh.jpg"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9573_News_6", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Napa-Valley23426t3tge.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Venezuela's migrant crisis could match scale of Syria's catastrophe, experts say", "body": "<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_0>Venezuela’s ongoing economic and political crisis has sparked a flow of millions of refugees that could lead to a humanitarian crisis even worse than that in civil war-torn Syria, according to some experts.While it’s hard to pinpoint the exact number of people who have fled Venezuela in recent years, some estimates put the number as high as four million – or more than 10 percent of the country’s population – with the majority of migrants heading to neighboring Colombia and Brazil.“The economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is perhaps the worst that the hemisphere has seen in modern history,” Dany Bahar, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in The Hill. “To keep proportions, bear in mind the estimates of refugees who left Syria during the war account for about five million individuals. Considering that the situation on the ground is deteriorating by the minute and the lack of food and medicine in Venezuela will probably get much worse, the four-million figure will only go up, and very rapidly.”Home to the world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela was for decades an economic leader in the Western Hemisphere. And despite a massive gap between rich and poor, it was a major destination for neighboring Colombians and other Latin Americans fleeing their less prosperous and more troubled homelands.But with the rise to power in 1999 of Hugo Chávez – whose socialist and Marxist economic reforms initially endeared him to the poor, but also created an unsustainable system of state spending – Venezuela’s economy began to creep toward crisis.The situation has only worsened under Nicolas Maduro, the late Chávez’s successor, who took power in 2013, and by a plunge in global oil prices the following year. Venezuela's oil-dependent economy has since shrunk an estimated 35 percent — more than the U.S. economy did during the Great Depression – and government exchange and price controls have devastated the private sector.On the streets of Caracas and other Venezuelan towns and cities, citizens have for months had trouble finding everything from medical supplies to basic food items – with dire consequences. An estimated three-quarters of the population has involuntarily lost some 20 pounds of weight, according to reports. Infant mortality rates have also skyrocketed, by as much as 30 percent in 2016.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_1>“It’s just a terrible situation,” Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, told Fox News. “In the short term, the Maduro government is only going to try to consolidate its control, and the million-dollar question is where the cracks will show in the government.”The repercussions of the Maduro government’s mismanagement are being felt not just by Venezuelans, but also by the countries on the receiving end of the refugee crisis. Colombia and Brazil have taken most of the refugees, but there are reports of thousands of Venezuelans heading to nearby Panama and the Caribbean islands and even as far off as Argentina and ChileIn neighboring Colombia, which for more than half a century struggled with its own bloody civil conflict pitting the government against leftist guerrillas, President Juan Manuel Santos has tried to manage the refugree crisis while he implements the terms of a 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group.The Colombian government estimates the number of Venezuelan refugees jumped 62 percent in the last six months of 2017, to 550,000. And an estimated one million Venezuelans have settled in the country since 2015, with the majority of them streaming across the Simón Bolívar International Bridge into Cúcuta, a city of only 670,000, where a joint Red Cross-United Nations refugee camp processes the migrant flow.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_2>While the Venezuelans were first met with sympathy by Colombians, there has been escalating problems amid reports of a spike in crime caused by the new arrivals. Colombia has also spent millions to shelter and feed the refugees.“The massive influx in a relatively short period of time comes as Colombian resources are stretched thin because of the peace agreement,” Arnson said. “Venezuelan migrants are beginning to spark resentment from Colombians and that’s a shame, because there was once a great deal of sympathy for their neighbors.”Speaking last week in Cúcuta, Santos promised to impose stricter migratory controls, suspend the daily entry cards given to Venezuelans, and send more security forces to the border.As in Europe, the migrant situation in many Latin American countries has become a game of political football. Santos, whose term ends in May, may not be facing re-election pressures, but he’s recently been taking a tougher stand against migrants as he tries to cement his legacy after brokering the controversial peace deal with the FARC.He warned that the government would strictly prosecute any unlawful behavior carried out by Venezuelans, and has promised to relocate tens of thousands of migrants across the country in an attempt to ease the strain on border states.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_3>Brazilians are also becoming frustrated with the migrant situation, with some turning to violence as a means of expressing their anger.Last week, two gasoline bombs were tossed through a window of a house where migrants were sleeping in the city of Boa Vista, Brazil. A 3-year-old girl suffered third-degree burns and her parents were injured in the attack – one of two that have occurred in the city of 300,000 in the last week.\"Everything points to xenophobia,\" Giuliana Castro, the public security secretary of the Brazilian state of Roraima, told Reuters by telephone. \"It is unacceptable violence against innocent people.\"On the international stage, there has been strong condemnation of the Venezuelan government, and calls for Maduro to step down. Peru's foreign minister said Tuesday that Maduro was no longer welcome at the meeting of hemisphere  leaders in April – a statement backed by a dozen other Latin American nations.Even in the event of administration change in Venezuela, experts say it will be some time before the crisis ebbs.“Venezuela is an ongoing political, economic and humanitarian crisis,” said Arnson, of the Woodrow Wilson center. “It will be years, if not decades, before the country even gets back to square one.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/venezuelas-migrant-crisis-could-match-scale-of-syrias-catastrophe-experts-say", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Colombian police officers stand in front of people assembling to try to cross into Colombia from Venezuela last month via Simón Bolívar International Bridge in Cúcuta, Colombia.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/colombia-venezuela-border-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "An elderly woman walks through a supermarket in Caracas, Venezuela.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/colombia-venezuela-border-3.jpg"}, {"caption": "Venezuelan migrants cooking at a rec center in Cúcuta, Colombia, where they have taken shelter.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/colombia-venezuela-border-4.jpg"}, {"caption": "Venezuelans queueing to try to cross into Colombia from Venezuela through Simón Bolívar international bridge in Cúcuta, Colombia", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9615_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/colombia-venezuela-border-2.jpg"}]}

Instead, Abbas will meet with Putin in Moscow in the latter part of Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.Fragments of the jet were found in the Ramenskoye area about 25 miles from the airport, according to REN-TV. Footage on state television showed them strewn across a snowy field with no buildings nearby. No on the ground casualties were reported.The flight took off from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport and spent about 5 minutes in the air before a signal was lost about 12 miles southeast of the airport, according to Flightradar24, a flight-tracking website.Witnesses in the village told local media they saw a burning plane falling from the sky, according to Sky News.A local resident told REN-TV she heard an explosion.\"I left the house, saw the plane, an explosion was heard and the sky turned red,\" the unnamed woman told the television station.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9630_News_4>The Russian Emergencies Ministry said in a series of tweets the recovery process would involve up to 300 people, and that the crash scene was only accessible on foot due to weather conditions.It is not immediately clear what caused the crash, with weather conditions and pilot error said to be among the possible reasons. Russia's Investigative Committee said all possible crash causes were being looked into.Russia's state news agency Tass said the plane had been flying since 2010, with a two-year break because of a shortage of parts.The plane, an Antonov An-148 jet, was ordered by Rossiya Airlines, a subsidiary of Aeroflot, but was put into storage during 2015-2017 because of a lack of parts. Tass reports it re-entered service for Saratov Airlines in February 2017.

Another man was shot to death before dawn in nearby Vega Baja while trying to stop thieves from stealing his generator.Thirty-two people have been slain in Puerto Rico in the first 11 days of the year, double the number killed over the same period in 2017. If the surge proves to be more than just a temporary blip, January could be the most homicidal month on the island in at least two years, adding a dangerous new element to the island's recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst disaster in decades.While the number of homicides did not immediately spike in the weeks after the hurricane struck on Sept. 20, police and independent experts say many killings appear at least partly related to its aftereffects.The storm has plunged much of the island into darkness, increased economic hardship and contributed to a sickout by police, all fueling lawlessness. What's more, officials say a turf war has broken out among drug gangs looking to grab territory after the storm's disruption.\"Hurricanes affect everyone, including criminals,\" said criminologist Jose Raul Cepeda.Already bankrupt, the island's overwhelmed government has fallen behind with millions of dollars in overtime payments owed to police officers, who have begun calling in sick in big numbers to protest. The sickout has taken about 2,000 police off the street each day in a territory that has 13,600 officers. It has forced more than a dozen police stations to close for several hours to a couple of days during the holiday period because of a lack of officers. No arrests have been made in the 32 killings this year.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9684_News_2>Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm, destroyed much of the island's electrical grid. For those police on duty, the streets are darker and more dangerous because power has been restored to only 60 percent of customers in the U.S. territory. Drug gangs are fighting to re-establish territory they lost in the disruption from Maria, which pushed thousands from their homes and left entire neighborhoods uninhabitable for weeks.Police Chief Michelle Hernandez resigned Monday after only a year on the job, and local and federal authorities are rushing from meeting to meeting to debate how to best protect 3.3 million Puerto Ricans, especially those still living in the dark.\"This has been devastating,\" said Ramon Santiago, a retiree who lives less than a block from where three bodies were discovered Sunday near a basketball court. \"You can't sleep peacefully in so much darkness.\"Puerto Rico's homicide rate is roughly 20 killings per 100,000 residents, compared with 3.7 per 100,000 residents on the U.S. mainland. In the last two years, Puerto Rico has seen an average of 56 homicides a month, a rate that held through December. Then after New Year's, the killings started accelerating.A man was shot Jan. 3 by a security guard while trying to rob a bakery. Two double homicides were reported Jan. 8 — two men found shot to death in a car near an upscale resort on the north coast and two other men discovered sprawled on the street near a public housing complex on the west coast. Five killings alone were reported Monday, in addition to three people wounded by gunfire during a shootout that night in the parking lot of a strip mall in Bayamon. This week, police say, the son of a former judge was killed after trying to write down the license plate number of a car whose occupants were firing a gun.\"The lack of police is increasing Puerto Rico's safety issues,\" said legislator Denis Marquez, who was mugged at gunpoint last month. \"Everybody is feeling that insecurity.\"Besides policing and getting the lights back on, he said, the government needs to address long-standing issues such as social inequality on an island with a 10 percent unemployment rate, where nearly 45 percent of its inhabitants lived in poverty before the hurricane.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9684_News_3>More immediately, the post-storm conditions have fueled a deadly struggle over drug gang territory, said Fernando Soler, vice president of a police officers' advocacy group.\"There's a war over the control for drugs,\" he told The Associated Press. \"They are taking advantage of all the situations occurring in Puerto Rico. There's no power and they believe there's a lack of police officers. ... Criminals are taking care of business that was pending before the hurricane.\"Inspector Elexis Torres heads a unit that is investigating eight homicides in a jurisdiction that includes the working-class city of Carolina near Puerto Rico's north coast, bordering the island's main airport.One of Puerto Rico's largest cities with nearly 160,000 people, Carolina had the triple homicide reported Sunday; a motel employee and a friend were found slain Tuesday in neighboring Trujillo Alto. Like nearly all the killings this year, they involve men in their 20s who were shot to death. Torres said he suspects both cases are drug related.He worries the number of killings will only increase as criminal gangs enter into cycles of revenge.\"Those victims likely belonged to some organization,\" Torres said of the triple homicide. \"This can have consequences.\"Cepeda, the criminologist, said drug traffickers have been entering rival territories to increase sales and recover losses after the storm disrupted their business.Hurricane Maria caused an estimated $95 billion in damage, with 30,000-plus jobs lost in an economy that was already struggling from an 11-year-old recession.The last time Puerto Rico saw a spike in violent crime was in 2011, when a record 1,136 killings were reported on an island of nearly 4 million people. Puerto Rico had seen a drop in killings, to 700 in 2016 and 679 last year.Hector Pesquera, secretary of the newly created Department of Public Safety, met this week with top police officials and federal authorities.\"We're in a process of analysis and of committed work to fight criminality in Puerto Rico,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/puerto-rico-fears-post-maria-murder-surge-11-days-32-slain", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9684_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9684_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ContentBroker_contentid-d7aac7d930fe49e0b71223a6f80f4240-1.png"}, {"caption": "", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9684_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ContentBroker_contentid-4b1f5ed056b8488f973babc0c5c6d133.png"}, {"caption": "In this Thursday, Jan. 11, 2018 photo, forensic workers remove the body of a man found fatally shot in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Authorities do not know if the sub rose to the surface to replenish its oxygen supply and charge batteries.More than a dozen airplanes and ships are participating in the multinational search despite stormy weather that has caused waves of more than 20 feet.

Most of the fatalities occurred there. Authorities said about 500 homes and businesses were damaged in the area.\"There is huge damage. Inestimable damage,\" Mandra Mayor Ioanna Kriekouki told local media.The disaster was among the worst to hit the Greek capital in decades, and the government declared a day of national mourning. Flags across the country flew at half-staff Thursday, including at the ancient Acropolis landmark in Athens.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9804_News_2>Wednesday's flash floods, which came after a severe overnight storm, turned streets into raging torrents of mud and debris, carried away vehicles, collapsed walls of houses and businesses and submerged a section of a major highway.Four people remained missing Thursday night, the fire department said after crews recovered the body of a man from the flooded basement of his home in the nearby Nea Peramos district. Two other missing men were found alive earlier in the day.Those still missing were reportedly all motorists, and search and rescue efforts were concentrating along the flooded highway.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9804_News_3>Twelve of the 23 people injured remained hospitalized, including an 82-year-old woman listed as being in serious condition in an intensive care unit, the National Health Operations Center said.Residents of the worst-hit areas struggled to clean up the devastation.Cars upended by the torrents lay piled on top of each other or flung against buildings. Some houses and businesses with collapsed walls had their interiors exposed to the elements. Rubble, twisted metal, household goods and smashed vehicles lined the roads.\"As you can see, everything is a mess,\" Mandra resident Katerina Sideri said.More storms lashed the Greek capital on Thursday, temporarily severing traffic on one of Athens' main central avenues, although they did not cause flash floods.Nearly all the injuries and fatalities occurred in Mandra and the surrounding area.

{"title": "Lives lost in Mexico quake could have been saved, engineers say", "body": "Warm lighting would enhance the wood floors' natural glow, the developer promised, so when all the custom lightbulbs burnt out, Anahi Abadia and her husband grudgingly drove to Home Depot to replenish supplies for their chic new flat in central Mexico City.They had just reached the register when the earthquake hit, shaking the store so fiercely the structure screeched. Minutes later, a text came in from their neighbor: The elegant apartment they had purchased only six months earlier had collapsed, rendering their new home a pile of crushed concrete.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9874_News_0>They were among the fortunate: Two women working in their building and dozens more perished on Sept. 19 in structure failures that several prominent engineers now say could have been prevented. Nearly two-thirds of the 44 buildings that fell in Mexico City were designed with a construction method called flat slab -- in which floors are supported only by concrete columns -- now forbidden in parts of the United States, Chile and New Zealand according to data compiled by a team of structural engineers at Stanford University and obtained by The Associated Press.Mexico City officials were widely lauded for tightening their building codes after thousands died in the 1985 earthquake. But they left out one crucial reform: a prohibition on the building technique that caused 61 percent of the building collapses in last month's magnitude 7.1 quake, which killed 369 people and blanketed tree-lined avenues in rubble.\"I keep thinking about what would have happened if I had still been in bed that afternoon.\" said Abadia, 26, who was in her bedroom that morning recovering from thyroid cancer, dreaming of furnishing the home she and her husband moved into in March. \"That was where we used to feel safe.\"The concrete slabs used to build floors and ceilings can be cast to include some rebar for reinforcement, and give builders greater flexibility in room layout and allow for higher ceilings.But in an earthquake, without reinforced concrete walls or lateral bracing to resist forces pushing structures sideways, buildings with that design can move too much. The columns, and connections between the slabs and columns, can easily break, prompting collapse, as was the case at a school where 26 people died, most of them children.\"We have known for 30 years that this system killed lots of people, so why are we still using it?\" asked Eduardo Miranda, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and global expert on earthquake-resistant design who compiled the data. \"The right decision after `85 would have been to completely ban this kind of construction. We could have saved lives.\"Abadia's trendy, ecofriendly apartment building with its wood-paneled balconies and solar-paneled roof collapsed when a corner column failed, and the flat-slab structure pancaked, Miranda said. There, the construction method was only the start of the problems: The units were designed by an architect whose license lapsed, and approved in a borough where auditors previously found illegal construction occurred unchecked.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9874_News_1>Experts concur that the devastation caused by last month's earthquake in the city of 8.9 million people could have been much worse had the building codes not been so strong, but it also has forced an uncomfortable conversation about their shortcomings. Now, as experts race to toughen standards to retrofit hundreds of damaged buildings, they are grappling with the reality that corruption has allowed hundreds of structures to be built outside the rules atop the soft soils of Mexico City's ancient lakebed.------After the quake, Abadia and her husband made their way home to find their flat in ruins, concrete and rebar tangled in the parking lot, pieces of Styrofoam filler used in the slabs floating in the breeze. Frantic neighbors gathered to search for a missing mother and daughter-in-law they knew cleaned an apartment down the hall, but the builder never appeared, so residents were left to sketch out their own graphs of the building's structure for rescue crews seeking a safe entry point.\"The two people working in (hash)404 couldn't get out,\" said Abadia, the scars from her operation still fresh at the base of her throat. \"How is it possible that after less than a year after it opened, the building was completely demolished?\"The day after the earthquake, the builder, Canada Building Group, sent residents an email saying that the company was not responsible for the collapse because the earthquake was a \"fortuitous event\" out of its control.Little did residents know that the private engineer who designed the building had been working under a license that expired in July 2015, online records show. City officials and the engineer did not return calls seeking further details about the expiration.And the borough official who heads the department that signed off on the plans the engineer submitted, including the waffle slab construction, reportedly had been suspended for illicit enrichment after an investigation by Mexico City's controller found he failed to report a home and two cars on his income statement. Neither the builder nor the official, Nicias Rene Aridjis, responded to AP's calls or messages but Aridjis has disputed the claim on Twitter.An audit performed by Mexico City's controller in 2015 shows that the same borough, Benito Juarez, had been rubber stamping construction drawings, allowing unpermitted and illegal construction to sail through its offices.\"It was found that the department of public works and urban development does not have a specific program to administratively verifyáconstruction drawings,\" the audit said.Borough officials did not return calls seeking comment, but previously announced they were investigating possible sanctions against the developer of Abadia's apartment building and planned to file a criminal complaint.\"It will need to be investigated ,\" said Renato Berron, head of the Institute for the Security of Constructions of Mexico City, a city agency. \"It can't be that something so new fell down.\"------In the crisis following the 1985 quake, a group of academics, building officials and engineers worked day and night to draft emergency recommendations to strengthen Mexico City's seismic codes, which were swiftly passed into law.The committee was under pressure to analyze what caused the collapses and quickly issue new norms, and some architects and builders were opposed to an outright ban on flat slab construction, said Miranda, whose work at the time was to write reports that informed the committee as they crafted tougher rules.\"There were lots of builders and owners who were not going to be happy that you just stopped their construction,\" said Miranda, who later went on to serve on Mexico's code committee in the 1990s, as well as on committees funded by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. \"These things start as technical conversations but then you run into policy and politics very quickly.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9874_News_2>The new codes allowed flat slab construction if developers designed the building to be seismically stronger than structures with beams or concrete walls.Authorities did not focus enough on evaluating if existing flat slab structures needed a seismic retrofit after 1985, Miranda said.\"It would have been better to have insisted very much about not using flat slab, or using it only it in very special cases,\" said Roberto Meli, a renowned structural engineer who served on the code committee in 1985, and went on to head the federal Center for Disaster Protection founded after that quake. \"There should have been more of a public information campaign to designers and builders that this was not a good solution.\"The new codes gave more responsibility to a network of private engineers who are hired and paid by developers, and who submit structural plans to borough authorities. In practice, that means private engineers -- not government experts -- vet projects' structural safety, and even city officials say the process can be vulnerable to corruption.\"Corruption can come in many forms, from the moment someone accepts a bribe to when someone falsifies documents, or fails to present the right structural plans to borough authorities,\" said Berron. \"If the construction rules were implemented as they are written, then this could be avoided. But that hasn't always worked out.\"In recent decades, middle-class enclaves close to the city's professional center have experienced vertiginous growth, and a dizzying array of unpermitted helipads and illegal, multi-floor garages have sprouted up between historic neoclassical homes. In the last 15 years, residents of Abadia's Benito Juarez borough and two others nearby have sent in the highest number of complaints about land-use violations to a city watchdog agency.Now, those same boroughs are home to dozens of damaged buildings that may need to be demolished or require emergency retrofitting, according to data from the Mexican Society of Structural Engineers. Miranda, whose team compiled the data on the 44 collapses through in-person visits and detailed structural analysis, estimates that hundreds of damaged buildings were built with flat slab systems, including some built relatively recently. Some 57 percent of the collapsed buildings had a soft story, a garage or other similar opening on the ground floor, Miranda's data shows.Meli said he and others on the expert committee will seek to strengthen retrofitting standards first, and by early next year he said they may reexamine flat slab, although he is not convinced prohibiting the method outright would have worked.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9874_News_3>Abadia, who is living temporarily at her mother-in-law's apartment on the other side of the vast city, said she hopes shoddy builders will be held responsible.\"We lost everything,\" she said. \"We know an earthquake is an unexpected event.

{"title": "Raqqa's escaping victims forced to live in toxic oil refinery with gasoline-laced water and no sewer system", "body": "<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9991_News_0>Thousands of Raqqa residents are trying to get out of the Islamic State's so-called capital in Syria, but their hell is far from over once they've escaped the war-ravished remnants of the city.Fox News has learned that at least 6,000 people are currently wedged in the Arisha displacement camp in the Hassakeh governorate – some 30 miles from Raqqa city – in what was once an oil refinery, and still teeming with toxic waste.“It is heavily polluted with oil, and people there have no choice but the bathe and drink from this water tainted with oil,” Ingy Sedky, a Damascus-based spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told Fox News. “And then getting sick – diarrhea, skin diseases – and there is absolutely no medical care.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9991_News_1>To make matters worse, Sedky noted, there is no sewer system and no functioning toilets on-site. Temperatures during the day can soar upwards of a blistering 120 degrees, igniting scores of heatstroke cases. As a short-term solution to mitigate some of these issues, the ICRC has distributed as many water bottles as possible. But it’s not practical or affordable to keep doing that for much longer.“The water pumping stations in the area need to be entirely rehabilitated,” she observed.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9991_News_2>Earlier this month, Sedky and a team from the ICRC and Syrian Arab Red Crescent returned from their first visit to the Raqqa governorate since ISIS took over four years ago, to assess the humanitarian needs of those who had escaped the conflicts in Raqqa and the nearby Deir Ezzor city, which has also long been besieged by ISIS.Those now living in Arisha, which was set up by local NGOs two months ago, live in nothing short of “inhumane” conditions where even a soiled, used mattress is a luxury.“People keep arriving daily, and there is a waiting list of a week to ten days just to get a dirty mattress to sleep on,” Sedky said. “Some sleep in cars.”<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9991_News_3>Medical care is said to be so scarce that even the basics are next to impossible to come by.“One man we met had a fresh burn and there wasn’t even a bandage for him to prevent further inflammation,” Sedky continued. “Each day is a matter of life or death.”An estimated 50 percent of those stuffed into the oil refinery-turned-makeshift-camp are children, with at least ten percent unaccompanied because their parents died in the fighting. Their future is anyone’s guess.The journey to get outside of Raqqa continues to be akin to hell. Smugglers charge some $5,000 just to transport desperate civilians 1,600 feet across the river, where some never make it to the other side. Most arrive at the various camps scattered in the area, including Arisha, with nothing but the clothes on their back – but grateful to have survived the squandering summer expedition along the mine-riddled region.And the fate of tens of thousands trapped inside the besieged city is largely unknown.The main supply routes have been cut off – prompting massive food shortages – as U.S.-backed forces prepare their final assault to drive the militants out. The electricity supply has been out of action for three months, and the water system has been heavily damaged from the aerial bombardment, igniting yet another illness epidemic.“They are going to the Euphrates to fetch water, and that is untreated,” Ingy added. “We are very worried about the outcome of this.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/raqqas-escaping-victims-forced-to-live-in-toxic-oil-refinery-with-gasoline-laced-water-and-no-sewer-system", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9991_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "August, 2017: A child in a makeshift, polluted bath at Arisha camp in Hassakeh governorate, Syria.

{"title": "2 children pulled from rubble on quake-hit Italian island", "body": "<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_0>Firefighters in Italy freed a 7-month-old baby and his older brother from rubble early Tuesday following a 4.0-magnitude quake on the resort island of Ischia off Naples, and rescuers were working on helping a third brother who remained trapped.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_1>At least two people were killed in the quake that struck just before 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday, while another 39 were injured and some 2,600 were left homeless. The victims were an elderly woman who was in a church that crumbled in the quake, and a second person who has been located in the rubble but not yet extracted.Video released from the firefighting service showed rescuers passing the baby, who was wearing a white onesie and appearing alert, out of the collapsed structure in hardest-hit Casamicciola at around 4 a.m. The news agency ANSA said cries of joy went up in the crowd and the boys' mother ran to take him.One of the baby's brothers was rescued some seven hours later, and quickly loaded onto a stretcher and into an ambulance.A firefighter photo showed the boy, identified as Mattias, being pulled out of the rubble in just his underwear covered with cement dust. Firefighters said on Twitter that they had reached the other boy, named Ciro, and were working on extracting him.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_2>The children's father told RAI state television that boys were in a bedroom when the quake struck, while he and his wife were elsewhere in the house. The mother, who Italian media say is heavily pregnant, managed to escape through a window while rescuers helped the father.Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari said they maintained voice contact with the two boys during the complex rescue operation to create an opening through the collapsed ceiling. The boys had been given bottles of water and a flashlight.\"We are in touch with both of the boys. We hear their voices and we are making ours heard to keep them calm,\" Cari was quoted by ANSA as saying.The quake hit during the height of the tourist season, and Italian television showed many visitors taking refuge in parks following the quake. Authorities began organizing ferries to bring tourists back to the mainland early Tuesday.Together with the nearby island of Capri, Ischia is a favorite island getaway for the European jet set, famed in particular for its thermal waters. Casamicciola was the epicenter of an 1883 earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people.Images from the quake zone show many buildings collapsed into rubble, while others showed signs of structural damage with deep cracks in exterior walls. Cars were overturned.The extent of the damage for a relatively light quake raised questions about the quality of construction on the island in the seismically active area off Naples and the active volcano, and the prevalence of illegally built structures.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_3>Fabrizio Pistolesi, the head of Italy's national architecture advisory board, told SKY that many buildings on the island were built before seismic codes were adopted. He also cited the high incidence of illegal construction on Ischia and generally in the Campagna region that includes both the resort island and Naples.\"We know well that in Campagna, more than 200,000 homes were illegally constructed, we are talking about homes constructed in absolute scorn of seismic norms,\" he told Sky TG24.Former Naples prosecutor Aldo De Chiara told Corriere della Sera that most of the recently constructed buildings on Ischia were built without necessary permits, and many with poor quality cement.\"We warned about the risk of collapses also in the case of not particularly serious temblors,\" De Chiara said. \"Unfortunately, what we had denounced, happened last night.\"The head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, told reporters that 2,000 people had been left homeless in Casamicciola and another 600 in Lacco Ameno.  He said authorities were checking the stability of hotels to see if they could be used as temporary housing.The quake came just two days shy of the one-year anniversary of a powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake that devastated several towns in central Italy. The quake on Aug. 24, 2016 killed more than 250 people in Amatrice and beyond and set off a months-long series of powerful aftershocks that emptied many towns and hamlets of their people.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/2-children-pulled-from-rubble-on-quake-hit-italian-island", "page_id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "People disembark in the harbor of Pozzuoli, part of the Metropolitan City of Naples, southern Italy, early Tuesday, August 22, 2017, after an earthquake hit the island of Ischia, off the Neapolitan coast on Monday.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/a97dd2a6-italy.jpg"}, {"caption": "This Monday, Aug. 21, 2017 photo shows a car amid debris following an earthquake in Casamicciola on the Italian resort island of Ischia", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/95a9b55a-earthquake2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Debris on a road after an earthquake hit the island of Ischia, near Naples, Southern Italy, Monday.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap_17233740415013-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "This Monday, Aug. 21, 2017 photo, shows people standing near a collapsed building following an earthquake in Casamicciola on the Italian resort island of Ischia.", "id": "Fox_Disasters_Total_9993_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/italy3.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Mexico earthquake: At least one adult feared trapped in rubble of school", "body": "Rescuers in Mexico City stepped up their efforts Thursday to find any more survivors in the rubble of a school, two days after a magnitude-7.1 earthquake killed at least 273 people and injured more than 2,000 others.For more than a day, rescuers at the Enrique Rebsamen school on the capital's south side said they were trying to free a 12-year-old girl. However, officials announced Thursday afternoon there were no children trapped -- but an adult, possibly a school worker, may still be in the rubble alive.Twenty-one children and five adults are now confirmed to have died at the school.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_10037_News_0>The debris removed from the school changed as crews worked their way deeper, from huge chunks of brick and concrete to pieces of wood that looked like remnants of desks and paneling to a load that contained a half dozen sparkly hula-hoops.Rescuers carried in lengths of wide steel pipe big enough for someone to crawl through, apparently trying to create a tunnel into the collapsed slabs of the three-story school building. But a heavy rain fell during the night, and the tottering pile of rubble had to be shored up with hundreds of wooden beams.Rescuers removed dirt and debris bucketful by bucketful and passed a scanner over the rubble of the school every hour or so to search for heat signatures that could indicate trapped survivors. Shortly before dawn Thursday the pile of debris shuddered ominously, prompting those working atop it to evacuate.Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the number of confirmed dead in the capital has risen from 115 to 137, bringing the overall toll from the quake to 273. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said two women and a man had been pulled alive from a collapsed office building in the city's center Wednesday night, almost 36 hours after the quake.Still, frustration was growing as the rescue effort stretched into Day 3.Outside a collapsed seven-story office building in the trendy Roma Norte district, a list of those rescued was strung between two trees. Relatives of the missing compared it against their own list of those who were in the building when the quake struck -- more than two dozen names -- kept in a spiral notebook.Patricia Fernandez's 27-year-old nephew, Ivan Colin Fernandez, worked as an accountant in the seven-story building, which pancaked to the ground, taking part of the building next door with it.She said the last time the family got an update was late yesterday: that about 14 people were believed to be alive inside, and only three had gotten out.\"They should keep us informed,\" Fernandez said as her sister, the man's mother, wept into Fernandez's fleece sweater. \"Because I think what kills us most is the desperation of not knowing anything.\"<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_10037_News_1>Referring to rumors that authorities intend to bring in heavy machinery that could risk bringing buildings down on anyone still alive inside, Fernandez said: \"That seems unjust to us because there are still people alive inside and that's not OK.\"She added, \"I think they should wait until they take the last one out.\"Seeking to dispel the rumors, National Civil Protection chief Luis Felipe Puente tweeted Thursday that heavy machinery \"is NOT being used\" in search-and-rescue efforts.President Enrique Pena Nieto declared three days of mourning as soldiers, police, firefighters and everyday citizens dug through the rubble, at times with their hands, gaining an inch at a time.<IMG Fox_Disasters_Total_10037_News_2>\"There are still people groaning. There are three more floors to remove rubble from. And you still hear people in there,\" said Evodio Dario Marcelino, a volunteer who was working with dozens of others at a collapsed apartment building.A man was pulled alive from a partly collapsed apartment building in northern Mexico City more than 24 hours after the Tuesday quake and taken away in a stretcher, apparently conscious.At least 52 people had been rescued alive since the quake, the city's Social Development Department said, adding in a tweet: \"We won't stop.\" It was a race against time, Pena Nieto warned in a tweet of his own saying that \"every minute counts to save lives.\"People have rallied to help their neighbors in a huge volunteer effort that includes people from all walks of life in Mexico City, where social classes seldom mix. Doctors, dentists and lawyers stood alongside construction workers and street sweepers, handing buckets of debris or chunks of concrete hand-to-hand down the line.At a collapsed factory building closer to the city's center, giant cranes lifted huge slabs of concrete from the towering pile of rubble, like peeling layers from an onion.

{"title": "Padres take Game 2 over Dodgers behind Manny Machado, Jake Cronenworth homers", "body": "Clutch pitching and timely hitting came by the way of the San Diego Padres, who tied their NLDS series against the Los Angeles Dodgers at one a piece with a 5-3 victory on Wednesday night. The long ball was a theme in this game early on, but the Padres benefited from it the most in the end. It was none other than their team – and potential National League – MVP Manny Machado quickly getting them on the board with a line shot just inside the left field foul pole off Dodgers legend Clayton Kershaw to make it 1-0. Later in the game, after a couple Dodgers threats to retake the lead, Jake Cronenworth smashed a majestic shot off Blake Treinen to right field to put the Padres up 5-3, giving them the right amount of cushion.  <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10079_News_0>But before that, it was a back-and-forth game between these NL West rivals. Freddie Freeman hit his first postseason home run as a Dodger right after Machado, as the expected pitcher duel between Kershaw and Yu Darvish didn’t really pan out the way some may have thought. That made it a 1-1 game in the bottom of the first. Then, it was Max Muncy taking Darvish deep to right center field to give the Dodgers the lead. Another run would come off the bat of Machado in the top of the third inning, followed by Cronenworth’s first RBI of the game to take a 3-2 lead. The Dodgers would tie things up immediately, with Trea Turner once again flexing his muscle after hitting a homer the night before. But with all these homers early on, it came down to clutch pitching late in the game that set the Padres apart. Right-hander Robert Suarez stepped up in the biggest way to allow his team to hold on to their lead and head to the bus down to San Diego with a win under their belts. The Padres took the lead, 4-3, in the top of the sixth but the Dodgers quickly found runners on base in the bottom frame. Will Smith and Muncy both hit singles, leaving runners on the corners with nobody out. Given the Dodgers’ potency at the dish, it seemed like a tie game would be a sigh of relief for San Diego. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10079_News_1>Instead, Suarez was put in the game to relieve Darvish and went to work.  He got Justin Turner to strikeout and then Gavin Lux grounded into a double play to avoid the jam. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Suarez put himself in his own predicament with runners on second and third with one out. But again, he didn’t deter from his objective, as he kept the 4-3 lead intact. Turner would ground out, and after intentionally walking Freddie Freeman, he got Smith to lineout to end the inning. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10079_News_2>There was also some flashing leather for the Dodgers, as things could’ve gotten much worse. Brusdar Graterol gave up the lead in the top of the seventh, but on a squeeze play, he made a bare-handed grab and quickly threw to home to nail Wil Myers trying to score. The next batter was Trent Grisham and he smacked a ball to dead center field, but Cody Bellinger tracked it all the way and made a nice leaping grab. In the end, though, the Padres’ bullpen didn’t have to go through those tough moments. Nick Martinez got the first two outs of the eighth inning before Josh Hader was brought in to close things in a four-out save opportunity, the first one since 2020. And he did just that, shutting things down despite a Freeman double in the bottom of the ninth. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10079_News_3>Game 3 between these two NL powerhouses will be played at Petco Park in San Diego on Friday at 8:37 p.m. ET.

{"title": "Tom Brady lauds Aaron Judge's historic season, praises Yankees slugger's mindset", "body": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers star Tom Brady had major praise for Aaron Judge as the New York Yankees superstar hoped to ride the wave of his regular-season success into the postseason.Judge joined Brady and sportscaster Jim Gray on the \"Let’s Go!\" podcast Monday, and the seven-time Super Bowl champion said he enjoyed watching a superstar athlete from another sport succeed.\"There’s nothing better than seeing, in my view, players in other sports that really accept what comes along with the success,\" Brady said. \"You’re in a big market (with the) Yankees, and you’ve continued to defy the odds. \"Really happy for you and all your success. Hopefully, you got a long career ahead of you. It’s going to be up to you to see what you do with it and how you take advantage of it.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_0>\"All the decisions you make over the course of time will all add up to the level that you can reach. It’s really been impressive to watch you in your humility even through this season. Just an MVP-caliber season. We know how all those votes go and all that. I always feel like, you know, ‘Did you do the best you could?’ And, from my standpoint watching you, you were amazing this year. So congrats and good luck in the postseason.\"In Judge’s pursuit of the American League home run record, he entered Yankees lore and was compared to some of the organization’s greatest players like Babe Ruth, Roger Maris, Joe DiMaggio and others. He said it was a \"shock\" for him to hear his name in the same breath as those other top players who wore pinstripes.\"It’s a shock because the names you mentioned — Roger Maris, Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, this list goes on and on — these are guys you see all around Yankee Stadium,\" Judge said. \"You see ‘em with the World Series ring, the World Series championships, and you’re like ‘There’s no way. Those are legends.' \"Those are Yankee legends. Baseball greats. How could I ever be mentioned with those guys? I’m just starting my career. I’m just a couple years in. What’re you guys talking about? It’s always a humbling experience being in the same sentence. Being mentioned with some of those greats. It’s like you said, it’s tough to get used to because I’m Aaron Judge, a kid from Linden, California, that wakes up everyday trying to help the Yankees win a ballgame. I’ve never seen myself as someone up there with Babe Ruth or Roger Maris, but it’s something I never take for granted.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_1>Brady, who has also been in that caliber quite a long time with the likes of Joe Montana and Steve Young, had some advice for Judge on how to handle the superlatives. He said Judge had the right attitude and mindset for the moment he’s dealing with now.\"That approach he says he instills in himself, when you look in the mirror every day what do you see? Aaron sees himself,\" Brady said. \"And he doesn’t see, ‘Oh, this is kinda who you remind me of, these are the people that you’re being compared to.’ It’s the best way to do it. You wake up every day, and you look at the person in the mirror and you go, ‘Did I give it the best I could?’ And if you did, you’re usually very satisfied with what you’ve become. And if you didn't, then you got that person looking right back at you knowing you cheated yourself,\" Brady said.\"I’ve always felt too, and I’ve looked up to those guys who really inspired me to play football at a young age growing up in the Bay Area, NorCal kid. I grew up with the Niners as may team and to watch Joe Montana and Steve Young and just to see how the success of that organization brought this community together. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_2>\"That community still loves the game of football because there was so much success. I think, Aaron, just continuing on the Yankee legacy – and obviously being in Boston for 20 years, I saw it first hand. I was at World Series games in 2001, the 9/11 year I was at. I think Game 3. I just know what those rivalries are all about and what the meaningful characters in those rivalries are. And Aaron mentioned a few of those, and now he gets to be part of that tradition. But you still feel the humility of where you started because you are who you are. You haven’t changed. \"Aaron, I’m sure, hasn’t changed. If he has humility, which I know he does, he looks at himself as a high school kid going to try and prove himself everyday going, ‘Man, I gotta go out there and I gotta do my job and I gotta work hard or else I’m not gonna be this person that lives up to his own expectations.’ He is who he is because of the characters that define him as a person, as a player and as a teammate. Not what other people may define him as, which always feels good when you’re internally motivated and the only way to have the consistency he’s had is to do that and to hit 62 home runs and to still have humility. That’s a personality trait. That’s a character trait. Those things aren’t gonna change in him.\"Judge thanked Brady for the kind words and acknowledged he tapped into the \"Do your job mantra\" that Brady’s former coach, Bill Belichick, had preached in New England.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_3>\"That means a lot. And one of the words you kinda hit on there was just doing your job. And it’s funny. Here, at Yankee Stadium, before we go out to our dugout, we have a little sign that just says ‘Just do your job.’ I always kinda tapped it on my way out to the field as just a reminder,\" Judge explained. \"I coulda been 0-for-4 the night before. I coulda been 4-for-4 the night before, hit a walk-off, whatever. Well guess what? That’s all over with. When you step on this field, you gotta do your job. If that’s me making a play out in the field, if that’s moving a runner over, if it’s me just picking up a teammate that just struck out. Just doing little things. That's part of my job. Going out there and do my job, everything else is just BS. Go out there and focus on one thing. That, for me, is what builds championship teams.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/tom-brady-lauds-aaron-judges-historic-season-praises-yankees-sluggers-mindset", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Tom Brady was not happy with his first half performance in his game against the New Orleans Saints Sunday.", "id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1425037696.jpg"}, {"caption": "The New York Yankees' Aaron Judge bats during a workout ahead of Game 1 of baseball's American League Division Series against the Cleveland Guardians, Monday, Oct. 10, 2022, in New York.", "id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/Aaron-Judge28.jpg"}, {"caption": "In this Oct. 21, 2018, file photo, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana speaks at a ceremony in Santa Clara, Calif.", "id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/NFL-Joe-Montana.jpg"}, {"caption": "The New York Yankees' Aaron Judge bats during a workout ahead of Game 1 of baseball's American League Division Series against the Cleveland Guardians Monday, Oct. 10, 2022, in New York.", "id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_10095_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/Aaron-Judge27.jpg"}]}

It’s a popular New York City lifestyle brand, but fans might not see it that way.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10182_News_0>Before the season began, Judge turned down an eight-year contract worth $230.5 million to $234.5 million and was reportedly looking for a nine-year deal worth around $319.6 million.

{"title": "Aaron Judge's 60th home run sparks miraculous Yankees comeback win against Pirates", "body": "In miraculous fashion, the New York Yankees came back from a four-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 9-8, on Tuesday night. It was none other than Aaron Judge, the MVP frontrunner, who gave the Yankees the spark they needed. He bashed his 60th home run of the season to tie Babe Ruth’s single season record and become one homer shy of the single-season American League record with Roger Maris, who hit 61 homers in 1961. It was a soaring shot that hit the left field bleachers at Yankee Stadium off Pirates pitcher Wil Crowe, and though Judge wasn’t too happy about it because his team was still down three runs, his teammates picked up the slack in the end. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10207_News_0>With bases loaded and no outs, Giancarlo Stanton, who has been struggling recently and didn’t have a hit on the night, hit a laser to left field that carried over the wall for a grand slam and sent everyone home happy with the win. \"It’s gotta get me rolling. Anything I can do to help the team win,\" Stanton told YES Network after the game.Stanton added that Judge’s home run \"sparked all of us. Helped us get this win, and he’s been doing this all year.\"To load the bases, it took Anthony Rizzo lacing a double to left center field followed by Gleyber Torres walking. Then, Josh Donaldson hit a blooper to center field that fell despite Pirates defenders being close to it. Stanton cashed in on the opportunity. Back to Judge, he’s also the first person to hit 60 homers in a season since 2001, when Chicago Cubs’ Sammy Sosa (64) and San Francisco Giants’ Barry Bonds, who set MLB’s single-season record with 73 homers, did it. Judge is the sixth person in MLB history to reach this feat. Judge has been adamant in saying he's really not paying attention to the history he's making because he just wants his team to win. \"I don't think about the numbers,\" he said after the game. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10207_News_1>But Judge had to admit \"it makes it that much sweeter\" that No. 60 came in a victory unlike No. 50 in Anaheim against the Los Angeles Angels that resulted in a loss. Judge and Stanton had the heroics in this one, but an overlooked storyline was Harrison Bader, returning from the IL and playing his first game as a Yankee since being traded by the St. Louis Cardinals for Jordan Montgomery, collected three RBI on the night. Bader made the best of opportunities with runners on base, tying the game at one apiece in the bottom of the fifth inning with a single and then giving the Yankees the lead an inning later with a two-run single to right field. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10207_News_2>Nestor Cortes, the Yankees’ ace this season, went five innings and gave up one run on five hits and two walks while striking out four.Luis Ortiz, the 23-year-old rookie for the Pirates, did well to keep the Yankees at bay to start the game.

{"title": "Tattoo safety: What to know about getting inked as Yankees' Aroldis Chapman recovers from infection", "body": "New York Yankees relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman will be taking time off to recover from an infection he reportedly received from a tattoo.Fans discovered Chapman’s need for recovery from a tweet the Yankees sent out on Saturday, Aug. 27.\"Prior to tonight’s game, the Yankees placed LHP Aroldis Chapman on the 15-day injured list (retroactive to 8/24) with an infected wound from a recent tattoo,\" the MLB team wrote. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10311_News_0>A detailed report from FOX Sports states that multiple sources have confirmed that Chapman, 34, felt irritation on his leg, where a tattoo was recently placed.Yankees manager Aaron Boone recently spoke about the infection before his team played against the Oakland Athletics, according to FOX Sports.Boone had revealed that Chapman had gotten a tattoo earlier in the week, but his infection ultimately led him to be hotel-bound Friday and Saturday, FOX Sports reported.\"He got a pretty bad infection,\" Boone said before the game . \"Hopefully he’s good in several days.\"Boone continued, \"My focus is on trying to get him right.\"Fox News Digital reached out to representatives of Chapman's for comment.Tattoo-related bacterial infections reportedly occur in people between 1% and 5%, according to a narrative review published in the National Library of Medicine in February 2022.The review, which is titled \"Viral Infections Confined to Tattoos,\" came straight from Medicina (Kaunas), a peer-reviewed scientific journal from the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences.\"Infections after tattooing can be caused by endogenous microorganisms, i.e., microorganisms that are part of the normal flora, as a result of altered skin barrier or exogenous microorganisms that enter the skin by inoculation during tattooing,\" researchers wrote in their review.While acknowledging that \"epidemiological and clinical data regarding infections on tattoos are scarce,\" the review states that tattoos have been linked to clinical problems, such as immune reactions, inflammatory disorders, infections and skin cancer.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10311_News_1>Researchers wrote that tattoo-related infections are mostly caused by bacteria and only a few have resulted in localized viral infections, including molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), according to documented records.\"In most cases, the lesions were strictly confined to the area of the tattoo,\" researchers wrote in their review.Even though tattoo-related infection stats indicate that most people have gotten and will continue to get tattoos without issue, there’s still a risk that it can happen.Cleveland Clinic – a nonprofit American academic medical center – says tattoo infections can occur anytime a person receives a tattoo because the process involves thousands of small ink deposits beneath the skin via needle.\"Even if you go to an experienced tattoo artist and the shop looks clean and sterile, it can happen,\" the medical center’s Tattoo Infection resource webpage states.Cleveland Clinic continued, \"There’s also a risk of infection with at-home tattoo kits and ceremonial tattoos that are part of cultural celebrations.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10311_News_2>Infections can reportedly happen when tattoo ink is contaminated or contains ingredients that can cause allergic reactions, according to Cleveland Clinic.Improperly sterilized or unsterilized tools and conditions are another common culprit.\"You should also ask your tattoo artist about the kind of ink they use and sterilization practices,\" Cleveland Clinic wrote. \"They should wear gloves at all times and use sterile wipes to clean your skin before, during and after your tattoo.\"The medical center also advises tattoo recipients to follow the tattoo aftercare instructions that are provided by the tattoo artist.Tattoo-related nontuberculous mycobacterial skin infections are hard to treat and can require four to six months of treatment with prescription drugs, according to the CDC.In some cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wrote that surgery might be required to remove infected tissue.Precautions the CDC recommends people take before they get a tattoo include seeking out services from tattoo parlors that are registered or approved by their local jurisdiction, requesting that a tattoo artist only use ink specifically made for tattoos, ensuring that a tattoo artist follows a hygiene protocol while tattooing and notifying a medical professional right away if skin problems occur after getting a tattoo.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10311_News_3>Other important details the CDC says tattoo customers should keep an eye out for include making sure their tattoo artist only uses tattoo-grade products, doesn't dilute ink before tattooing due to cross-contamination risks, only uses sterile water if ink dilution or tool rinsing is absolutely necessary and uses an aseptic technique while tattooing.If a tattoo customer suspects that they’ve been infected, the CDC advises people should proceed by notifying their tattoo artist and the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch program.", "page_url":

The remaining 46 games are against interleague opponents: a home and road two-game series against a so-called natural rival and a single three-game series against each of the 14 other clubs in the opposite league.\"This new format creates more common opponents, both in the division and among your league opponents, so that typically when you’re competing for the wild card, there’s a much higher percentage of common opponents across divisions,\" said Chris Marinak, MLB’s chief operations and strategy officer. \"And we think that equity is good for the competition on the field.\"On the marketing side, we think that the new schedule gives our fans more opponents at home, so they get to see a broader array of clubs in their ballpark,\" Marinak said. \"And probably more importantly, it gives us a chance for our star players to get exposure more nationally and be seen in more places throughout the season.\"The American League used a balanced schedule from 1977-2000 and the National League from 1993-2000, with interleague play starting in 1997 and limited to 15-18 games per season for each team.

{"title": "Meet the American who created the nation's first sports bar in St. Louis: World War II veteran Jimmy Palermo", "body": "Jimmy Palermo grew up in a bootlegger bar during Prohibition and then stitched up the shattered bodies of American GIs in the Battle of the Bulge as a World War II U.S. Army medic.He returned home to St. Louis — and hit a grand slam as a visionary in American hospitality.He turned his dad’s pub into what his family and local sports fans argue is America’s first sports bar: Palermo’s Tavern at 3701 Sullivan Avenue in the Gateway City. The family ran the pub from 1933 to 1966. It was at the forefront of an entirely new concept in American hospitality. Palermo's Tavern featured local beer, casual food, sports memorabilia on the walls and more sports shown above the bar in the earliest days of the TV era.\"Years before the advent of Buffalo wings, satellite hookups or wide-screen television, Palermo’s neighborhood tavern could take the title as America’s original sports bar,\" said Palermo's son, Tom Palermo.The younger Palermo, as publisher of SpaceCoastDaily.com, chronicles life on Central Florida's Atlantic Coast. He’s also a repository of his family’s fascinating legacy as immigrant American tavern keepers. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_0>Jimmy Palermo (1920-2010) and his tavern were deeply rooted in the fabric of the national pastime. It was located directly across from the late, great Sportsman’s Park, a legendary arena in baseball lore. The ballpark for many decades was the home of both the former St. Louis Browns of Major League Baseball’s American League and the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League. St. Louis was a rare two-team baseball town — and Palermo’s sat on the hot corner of the Golden Age of baseball. \"The players from both the home and visiting teams walked right by the entrance of the bar on their way to the park,\" Tom Palermo told Fox News Digital. The heaviest hitters of baseball became regulars, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Ted Williams, which only added to the pub’s allure as a sports-themed hotspot. The national sports bar phenomenon soon followed. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_1>The United States today boasts more than 1,200 sports bars, according to IBIS World, which tracks consumer data across various industries. Buffalo Wild Wings alone — the nation’s largest sports bar operator — claims 1,300 sports bars in nine countries, most of those in the United States.\"Sports is the universal language here,\" St. Louis sports and lifestyle marketing executive Pat Imig of Imig Communications told Fox News Digital. \"We’re also the original home of Budweiser and Anheuser-Busch brewery. Baseball and beer — the first sports bar was a natural progression.\"Vincent \"Jimmy\" Palermo was born in St. Louis on Sept. 20, 1920. He grew up in the era of bootleg booze and baseball. His parents, Paul and Mary, were immigrants from Sicily. Paul Palermo lived a tough childhood as a laborer in a southern Illinois coal mine. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_2>\"At age 12, he took care of the mules that hauled the coal carts through the mines, and by the time he was 15 he was chipping coal for a nickel a ton,\" writes Tom Palermo. The elder Palmero left his dangerous life underground and made his way to St. Louis, where he got into the tavern business and began building a family. He and Mary had two children: Vincent, known as Jimmy, and Joseph. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_3>Amid Prohibition, which began in 1919, Paul and Mary Palermo operated a restaurant and hot dog stand and lived with their boys in an apartment above the operation. They also sold dried goods, confections — and illicit liquor. Young Jimmy was put to work licking labels from other products and pasting them back onto contraband bottles of booze. At the same time, starting at 6 years old, he became a bat boy for the St. Louis Browns across the street.He spent 15 years with the team, eventually rising to clubhouse manager. He also began a career as a professional umpire and hoped to work his way up to the major leagues.Then Uncle Sam came calling.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_4>Palermo was drafted by the U.S. Army, trained as a medic and shipped off for England in 1943 to await the invasion of Europe.\"He landed on D-Day + 10,\" said Tom Palermo, 10 days after the D-Day landing in France on June 6, 1944. He worked and eventually managed field hospitals treating American boys who were very badly injured in combat.  Among other engagements, Palermo fought with the Allied forces who withstood a last-ditch German offensive in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.In the classic fashion of the Greatest Generation, Palermo rarely discussed his wartime experiences. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_5>\"Then came ‘Saving Private Ryan,’\" said Tom Palermo, referencing the 1998 World War II drama starring Tom Hanks, acclaimed for its realistic portrayal of the horrors of combat. \"My brother and I went to see the movie. We were sitting with Dad having dinner talking about it. He just opened up right there and starting tell us about the war for the first time.\" His unit was heading into the Battle of the Bulge by train when it was hit by German artillery. Pop Palermo came close to getting killed. He also recounted the shocking scenes of an Army field hospital amid one of the deadliest engagements of World War II.Nearly 70,000 Americans were killed or wounded in just five weeks of the Battle of the Bulge. \"Dad saw a lot of gore,\" Palermo said. Palermo returned to St. Louis after the war, married Nadine Short in 1946, began a family and took up the business of running his dad's bar. He filled the walls with memorabilia from his days as a Browns bat boy: ballpark photos and gloves, caps and bats used by baseball's best athletes. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_6>He befriended the greatest players of the era, perhaps most notably legendary Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams. The two met in the Browns' clubhouse during Williams' rookie year of 1939. The vets grew tight after the war. Palermo even counted baseball royalty among his family. St. Louis native and Yankees legend Yogi Berra was his brother-in-law. Nadine Palermo and Berra's wife Carmen were sisters.Mostly, Palermo set about the work of serving the loyal baseball fans of St. Louis.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_7>Palermo’s truly became a sports bar with the advent of television — which exploded onto the American entertainment scene in the years after World War II. Palermo was quick to adopt the newest technology and see the potential benefits for his business, said his son.He began installing 12-inch black-and-white Farnsworth television sets, among the earliest TVs ever sold in America, around the bar in 1947. He continued to update the bar's TV technology as it improved. Visitors at Palermo’s by the late 1940s found the atmosphere and attractions we now recognize as the hallmarks of the American sports bar.It was filled with sports memorabilia. It was frequented by a who’s who of great athletes. It offered barroom entertainment such as pool, pinball and shuffleboard. Guests feasted on a menu of casual ballpark favorites, hot dogs, hamburgers and French fries, most notably, and quenched their thirst with local beers from a city that's long been synonymous with beer making.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_8>Palermo’s Tavern quickly became the top place in town to enjoy boxing matches or baseball on the tube. It was a unique concept in American hospitality. \"Nobody stakes a better claim to ‘first sports bar in America' than the Palermo family,\" said Imig, the St. Louis hospitality consultant.  The city, he said, still has more than its fair share of sports bars today, including one called Sportsman’s Park — named for the arena that made St. Louis a baseball hotbed and made Palermo’s Tavern an American original. Vincent \"Jimmy\" Palermo died on Dec. 1, 2010, at age 90. He was a veteran of two conflicts, interrupting his career a second time in 1950 to serve in the Korean War.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_9>He served his last hot dog and frosty beer at Palermo's in 1966. Today, Sit & Sip Cocktail Lounge occupies the 3701 Sullivan Ave. site of Palermo's Tavern.The Browns left town in 1953, becoming the Baltimore Orioles. The Cardinals moved to a new arena across town, Busch Stadium, in 1966. After the 1965 season, Palermo's no longer felt like the center of the Midwestern sports world.   <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News_10>Jimmy Palermo closed the tavern to focus on his other businesses, including a large St. Louis nightclub and various real estate holdings. He and Nadine retired to Florida in 1986. He was buried at Bushnell National Cemetery in Florida, beneath a gravestone noting his U.S. Army service in two separate conflicts.The sports bar concept got a renewed boost with the advent of satellite broadcasting in the 1970s. Sports fans now filled bars to enjoy games they couldn't get on local TV. Los Angeles Rams football star Dennis Harrah opened a pub in Long Beach, Calif., in 1979 called Legends, which still in operation today. It touts itself as the first \"modern\" sports bar in America, a sort of cap-tip to the legacy pioneered by the likes of Palermo’s Tavern.\"My mom and dad were pioneers,\" said Palermo. \"They were in the right place at the right time. They got to enjoy baseball’s glory days.\" \"But they also saw a new way of doing business. We’re very proud of what they achieved.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//lifestyle/meet-american-created-sports-bar-st-louis-wwii-veteran-jimmy-palermo", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_10392_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Jimmy Palermo (at right, in white shirt) serves patrons from behind the bar at Palermo's Tavern.

{"title": "Yankees snap losing streak, Aaron Judge hits home run in victory over Mariners", "body": "On a night when the Yankees ended their losing streak and Aaron Judge homered yet again, it wasn't all good news for New York.Judge hit his 44th homer, Josh Donaldson went deep and drove in three runs, and the Yankees snapped a five-game skid by beating the Seattle Mariners, 9-4, on Monday.Donaldson doubled twice and Andrew Benintendi also had two doubles and three RBIs as the Yankees hammered Seattle pitching. But they got a bad break early — Matt Carpenter fractured his left foot when he fouled off a pitch in the first inning.\"I have no doubt in my mind that he’s going to still make an impact on this team even while he’s hurt,\" said Yankees starter Jameson Taillon, who threw seven innings to get the win. \"He’s come in here right away and made an impact on a lot of people. He’s not afraid to talk pitching with the pitchers. He’s not afraid to give honest feedback. He’s one of the best guys that I've been around and played with, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he finds his way back and makes an impact.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10415_News_0>Carpenter, who was in a walking boot after the game, said there's no timeframe yet for a possible return, and he would first need to see a foot specialist. Carpenter began the night hitting .307 with 15 home runs and 37 RBIs in just 127 at-bats.\"My mindset is that this won’t be the end for me here this year. I’m hopeful that I can come back and contribute,\" he said.Even without Carpenter, the Yankees had plenty of punch to stop their longest losing streak of the season.Donaldson and Benintendi got it started as New York knocked around Logan Gilbert for seven earned runs and 10 hits — six for extra bases. That was plenty for Taillon (11-2), who scattered three hits over seven innings.New York manager Aaron Boone held a team meeting ahead of the series opener in Seattle after the Yankees were swept in St. Louis last weekend. His message was mostly a reminder that the Bronx Bombers are arguably the most talented team in the American League and following the trade deadline have the pieces to make this a special season.YANKEES' MATT CARPENTER SUFFERS LEFT FOOT FRACTURE VS. MARINERS<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10415_News_1>Message received.\"It was a nice little get-together pregame. We went out there with a ton of energy,\" Taillon said.Donaldson had a two-run single in his first at-bat, launched his 11th home run with two outs in the third, and hit the first of three consecutive doubles in the fifth that ended Gilbert’s night.\"The last two weeks I’ve felt like my at-bats have certainly been more consistent,\" Donaldson said.Benintendi’s two-out double in the third inning scored Gleyber Torres, and his double over the head of left fielder Jesse Winker in the fifth scored two and was the final batter for Gilbert.Seattle’s young right-hander gave up a season high in runs and hits. It was the first time in 23 starts this season that Gilbert (10-5) failed to pitch at least five innings.\"I guess it was a matter of execution. They hit some good pitches that I made, and, of course, when you leave it over the middle or get behind in the count, good hitters are going to hit it,\" Gilbert said.Taillon gave up solo home runs to Mitch Haniger in the first and Cal Raleigh in the seventh but otherwise avoided major damage. J.P. Crawford worked an 11-pitch, bases-loaded walk in the fourth to plate a run, and Raleigh followed with a long fly ball that had home run distance but was pulled slightly foul.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10415_News_2>Otherwise, Taillon cruised. He walked three and struck out six in winning his first start since beating Boston on July 16.Judge connected in the ninth.Yankees: 1B Anthony Rizzo was out of the lineup for the fourth straight game due to an ongoing back issue. Boone said the hope is Rizzo will have improved enough to return to the lineup Tuesday. Rizzo missed time in July with the same lower-back issue.Mariners: Winker left in the fifth due to back spasms. He was replaced by Jake Lamb. Seattle manager Scott Servais said Winker is day-to-day. ... LHP Ryan Borucki exited in the ninth in the middle of an at-bat with a forearm strain after throwing a pitch to Benintendi. ... Servais said CF Julio Rodriguez was going to take additional swings before Monday’s game to get a gauge on where he’s at with his wrist injury. Rodriguez could get activated Wednesday or Seattle could use Thursday’s off day and bring him back Friday. ... INF/OF Dylan Moore (back spasms) is expected to come off the injured list Wednesday. ... LHP Matthew Boyd (elbow) threw live batting practice as he continues his recovery from elbow surgery last September. Boyd’s next step is expected to be a rehab assignment.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10415_News_3>Yankees: RHP Gerrit Cole (9-4, 3.56 ERA) looks to rebound from his last start in which he allowed six runs in the first inning against Seattle. Cole is 6-3 with a 2.48 ERA in 10 career starts against the Mariners.Mariners: RHP Luis Castillo (5-4, 2.95) makes his first start at home since being acquired from Cincinnati.

But Bart popped up from his tag and motioned to the dugout to challenge the play. The Giants did and the call was overturned to thunderous boos from the sellout crowd of 40,686.There was a slight delay as some fans threw trash onto the field, prompting a warning from the PA announcer.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10416_News_0>\"What a pick by Joey,\" Wood said. \"They don’t get any better than that. That was a sick relay. Gonzo hustled to make a play in the corner, Craw made a pretty good throw and Joey made just an unbelievable pick to save the game.\"Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford said Bart \"made one of the best picks and tags I think I’ve seen from a catcher. That was a great play from him. Luis (Gonzalez) gave me a great throw, right to my chest. There were a lot of good parts to that play.\"Crawford said he wasn't real confident the call would be overturned.\"I thought live it was possible he was out, but obviously with the safe call and how close it looked on some of the replays that they put on the scoreboard, anyway, I kind of thought it would stand,\" the shortstop said. \"I saw an angle after the inning that looked like his hand definitely popped up and Joey got the tag there.\"Said Giants manager Gabe Kapler: \"He was clearly out from our vantage point. It looks like we won tonight's game with some defense.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10416_News_1>\"First thing you look at is how well Gonz played it off the wall,\" Kapler said. \"He was perfectly positioned to get a good throw off. Craw’s feet were excellent; he’s one of the best relay men in the league and a good strong throw to the plate. Obviously a really challenging pick. Joey made a perfect pick and an optimal tag.\"It was the fifth straight loss and second consecutive shutout for the Padres, who fell to 1-5 since obtaining Juan Soto and Bell in a blockbuster trade last Tuesday.

They opened the inning with consecutive singles by Evan Longoria, J.D. Davis and Brandon Crawford to load the bases, and Thairo Estrada hit a sacrifice fly. Snell walked Bart to load the bases again before retiring the final two batters of the inning.Snell (4-6) got into trouble right away when the Giants had runners on first and third just two batters into the game but he got out of it by striking out the heart of the order.Snell allowed one run and six hits in 5 2/3 innings, struck out eight and walked two.TRAINER'S ROOMGiants: Reinstated Longoria from the 10-day injured list and optioned OF Bryce Johnson to Triple-A Sacramento.Padres: Manager Bob Melvin said reports from Fernando Tatis Jr.'s minor league rehab assignment indicate the star shortstop feels good after playing Saturday and Sunday with the Double-A San Antonio Missions, who were off Monday.

{"title": "Chris Bassitt dominates in Mets' victory over the Reds", "body": "Chris Bassitt scattered eight hits over eight innings and Starling Marte hit a two-run homer in the first, leading the New York Mets to a 5-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Monday night.With their 13th victory in 15 games, the Mets extended their NL East lead to seven games over idle Atlanta. New York just took four of five from the defending World Series champions at Citi Field last weekend.Bassitt (9-7) allowed an unearned run and walked one while striking out eight in his second eight-inning outing this season and fifth in 114 career starts. He threw 114 pitches before getting pulled by manager Buck Showalter, most by a Mets starter this year and two shy of his career high set in August 2019.\"I want to go 115 or 120 pitches every start,\" Bassitt said before grinning. \"But Buck don’t let me.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10417_News_0>Bassitt has thrown at least 100 pitches in a start 25 times since the beginning of 2019.\"I’ve done that for years.

He faced the minimum through three innings before wriggling out of trouble the rest of the night. The Reds scored in the fourth, when he induced three fielder’s choice groundouts — all from second baseman Jeff McNeil to shortstop Francisco Lindor.The right-hander began a 1-6-3 double play to end the fifth and left the bases loaded in the sixth, when he got Aristides Aquino to line out.\"Give him a lot of credit. It’s like you get something going and because of all that, he knows how to get out of it,\" Reds manager David Bell said.Cincinnati stranded two more in the seventh before Jake Fraley was left at first in the eighth, when Bassitt struck out Aquino on three pitches following a visit from pitching coach Jeremy Hefner.\"Just moxie — he's such a competitive guy,\" Showalter said. \"Just a guy that likes to compete and do what is expected of him.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10417_News_1>The Mets struck quickly against Reds starter and former New York prospect Justin Dunn (0-1), who was pitching in the majors for the first time since June 17, 2021.

The AL MVP struck out seven A’s, which ended his streak of six consecutive starts with double-digit strikeouts just short of Nolan Ryan’s franchise-record seven.\"He had his fair share of punchouts, but that’s what he’s going to do,\" A’s manager Mark Kotsay said. \"I think we had good at-bats and got his pitch count up and got him out early.\"Ohtani was fairly happy with his slider-heavy mound performance, but he lamented his effort at the plate. He has received one run of support from himself and his fellow Angels hitters during his three-game skid.\"Especially in the situation with (runners on) second and third, one out (in the third inning), I felt like if I came through in that at-bat, we could have won the game,\" Ohtani said through his translator. \"Since I didn't, I felt like that was the biggest moment of the game.\"Ohtani left for a pinch-hitter in the seventh because of a cramp in his right forearm, but he said he expects to play Thursday. Los Angeles had pinch-hit for Ohtani only twice previously this season, both occurring after Ohtani felt minor injuries.\"If I’m healthy enough to play, I want to be out there,\" Ohtani said. \"It feels like I can’t really afford to miss games at this point.\"Luis Rengifo had a tying RBI double in the fifth for the Angels, who have lost four of six in another dismal season.Murphy had an RBI single in the fourth, followed by his two-run shot to left.

Left-hander Tucker Davidson also arrived in Anaheim from Atlanta with plans to enter the rotation Sunday in Seattle.Ohtani started out with three innings of one-hit ball, but Oakland scored an unearned run in the fourth when Ramon Laureano reached on Rengifo's throwing error, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Murphy's single.Rengifo atoned in the fifth with a two-out double to the gap, scoring Magneuris Sierra. Rengifo has a hit in 30 of his last 33 games, and he was the Angels' only consistent hitter in July while they batted a pathetic .199 as a team.ANOTHER MICKEY IN ANAHEIM<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10443_News_2>Moniak is a native of North San Diego County, about an hour south of Angel Stadium. Although he managed just 12 hits in 47 big league appearances over the past three seasons, Moniak has made significant progress this year, both before and after his hand was broken by a pitch in the final game of spring training.\"I’ve always been a guy that maybe takes a little bit to get comfortable at every level, and once I get comfortable, it’s on from there,\" said Moniak, who batted .310 with a .924 OPS across the minors this season. \"So, wasn’t really given that opportunity (in Philadelphia), which makes sense. They’re always in a pennant hunt with a lot of money on the field, so just to be here and be told that you’re going to go out and play and have some fun is huge.\"Angels manager Phil Nevin, whose son played travel ball with Moniak, said the outfielder will play regularly for the rest of the season.TRAINER'S ROOMAngels: OF Mike Trout planned to start rotational exercises Wednesday in his comeback from a complicated back injury.

The Yankees are 70-34, the first team to reach 70 wins this year.Before the game, the Yankees acquired starter Frankie Montas and reliever Lou Trivino from Oakland, three days after Seattle obtained Luis Castillo, perhaps the best available starter on the trade market. Castillo is lined up to start the series finale on Wednesday against Yankees ace Gerrit Cole.\"Just a dominant starter, been a dominant starter for quite a while now,\" Judge said of Montas. \"He’s got some ridiculous stuff and just happy that we don’t have to face that down the road again.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10478_News_0>Rizzo put the Yankees ahead in the first with a three-run homer off Marco Gonzales (6-11).

He allowed two runs and six hits in five innings with three walks and a strikeout.With Alex Rodriguez seated behind home plate, Judge hit a 420-foot drive, sending a first-pitch 87.4 mph fastball into the visiting bullpen in left field, after doubling on the first pitch he saw ahead of Rizzo’s homer.\"It’s fun watching what he’s doing right now,\" Boone said. \"So I think obviously that was part of his game plan tonight, being aggressive. Got what he was looking for in the first couple of at-bats and put great swings on it.\"Judge is on pace for 67 homers, six more than the Yankees record set by Roger Maris in 1961.

It was his sixth homer in 17 career games against Kansas City.Then in the fifth, Zerpa was attempting to run down a grounder down the line when he reached to glove the ball and flip to first.

They heartily applauded Soto in his first at-bat.Whether he ends up in LA or not, Soto put on a show.His two-run triple capped a four-run fifth inning and the lowly Washington Nationals defeated the NL West-leading Dodgers 4-1 on Monday night, snapping Los Angeles’ 11-game home winning streak.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10524_News_0>\"Our best player, Soto, comes up with a big hit and drove in some runs,\" Nats manager Dave Martinez said. \"It was a big moment for Juan to come through.\"The Nationals (33-65) brought the worst record in the majors into Dodger Stadium, where they won for the first time since the 2019 NL Division Series, against the team with baseball's best record (64-31). The Dodgers' season-high eight-game overall winning streak ended.\"They shut down a really good team,\" Martinez said of his bullpen. \"Guys played with a lot of energy.\"Soto said before the game he's trying not to think about the trade talk swirling around him ahead of the Aug. 2 trade deadline. The chatter isn't affecting him at the plate. Soto is batting .362 with a 1.260 OPS this month, including six homers, a triple and two doubles.The 23-year-old All-Star right fielder left his trophy from winning last week's Home Run Derby in the visitors’ clubhouse, knowing that he’d soon be back here.

{"title": "Blue Jays sweep Red Sox, take advantage of defensive miscues", "body": "The Boston fans who drove out to see David Ortiz inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday earned an added bonus for their troubles: They didn't have to watch the Red Sox post another stinker against another AL East opponent.Before the former Boston slugger could even step up to the microphone in Cooperstown, the team he led to three World Series championships had already fallen behind 5-0 and was on its way to an 8-4 loss and a three-game sweep by the Toronto Blue Jays.\"The brand of baseball we’re playing is awful,\" manager Alex Cora said after the Red Sox lost their fifth straight game and their ninth in 10 tries to fall to .500 for the season.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10535_News_0>\"We’re not catching the ball. We’re not putting in good at-bats, We’re not throwing strikes. It’s bad. It’s really bad right now,\" Cora said. \"But we’re talented. And we can turn around quick, and it starts tomorrow.\"Two days after Raimel Tapia hit an inside-the-park grand slam in a record-setting 28-5 Blue Jays victory, he had a bases-loaded triple in the first to spot Toronto to a 5-0 lead off top Boston prospect Brayan Bello (0-2) — one of five players in the Red Sox lineup who started the season in the minors.Tapia had three hits and drove in four runs, giving him 10 RBIs for the series, and Vladimir Guerrero had four hits for the Blue Jays. Toronto also took advantage of three errors and a series of other blunders by Boston, which has not won a series against an AL East opponent in 12 tries this season and is just a half-game ahead of last-place Baltimore in the division.On Sunday, the Red Sox kicked the ball around the outfield, fumbled it in the infield, threw it into a baserunner’s back, missed tags and missed bases and generally played like the minor leaguers that half of them were on opening day.\"Defensively we have taken a step back the last 14 days,\" Cora said. \"We were really good defensively early on. ... It seems like right now the game speeds at one point in the game, and it looks horrible.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10535_News_1>Tim Mayza (4-0) earned the win as the most effective reliever after inducing a double play in the seventh. Toronto starter Ross Stripling allowed two runs in four innings before reliever Trevor Richards gave up two more, when Jarren Duran tripled and scored in the fifth, then Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a solo homer in the sixth to make it 8-4.But the biggest cheer of the day was when a clip from Ortiz’s acceptance speech was played on the scoreboard.The Red Sox could have used him. Instead, the lineup was missing ailing All-Stars J.D. Martinez and Rafael Devers and top offseason acquisition Trevor Story, with the bottom five in the batting order all hitting worse than .220.Wilting in the 98-degree heat and already trailing 5-1, the Red Sox were booed by the home crowd in the second inning, after George Springer stole second base and took third when Christian Vázquez's throw went into the outfield and was kicked around there by left fielder Franchy Cordero.Bello allowed five runs on nine hits and two walks, striking out two in four innings; he has yet to make it into the fifth in any of his three major league starts. But this time he was hurt by some bad luck and some bad defense.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10535_News_2>Toronto loaded the bases in the first inning on two softly hit balls — one that bounced off third base — and a walk, then Cavan Biggio connected for a two-run single off third baseman Jeter Downs that was also booted by Cordero. Tapia made it 5-0 on a bases-loaded triple to the right-center gap.\"The baseball was in their favor today,\" Bello said \"I just needed to keep working, keep learning and be ready for my next start.\"The Blue Jays added three more in the fifth, which began when Hirokazu Sawamura walked leadoff batter Teoscar Hernández when the Red Sox reliever put his fingers to his mouth with a 2-1 count after being warned, resulting in two automatic balls.Hernandez came around to score on Tapia's single, and another run scored when Downs threw the ball into the back of a baserunner heading home; Downs also muffed a routine grounder.

That streak came during their most recent playoff season in 2001, when they went 116-46.The 14-game winning streak is the longest going into an All-Star break in major league history.\"That’s a tough one,\" France said. \"I think it’ll be good for us to kind of let our bodies recover. There’s a lot of guys in that locker room, they play every day, they’re playing hurt, they’re playing banged up. These next couple of days will be good for them and hopefully we can just keep that rolling.\"Cal Raleigh's two-run homer put the Mariners ahead for good in the fourth inning as they matched reigning World Series champion Atlanta's June streak for the longest this season.

{"title": "White Sox demolish Twins, Dylan Cease finishes off first half with masterful start", "body": "As Dylan Cease unwound in the clubhouse after his latest masterful start, the soft-spoken right-hander downplayed any lingering disappointment about being left off the All-Star team.The jovial Chicago White Sox were more than happy to state his case.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10585_News_0>Cease spun a one-hitter over seven innings as the White Sox walloped Minnesota 11-0 on Sunday to surge into the break by winning three out of four games against the first-place Twins.\"That's what he's done all year,\" manager Tony LaRussa said. \"He's picked us up at important times.\"Cease (9-4) allowed only a fifth-inning single to Alex Kirilloff and two walks. Andrew Vaughn had three hits and three RBIs to help bring the White Sox within three games of Minnesota in the AL Central. Cleveland is two games back.\"We showed up,\" Cease said, \"and we showed that we’re still here.\"The White Sox had 16 hits on a hot and humid afternoon, including home runs by Yoán Moncada, Vaughn and Josh Harrison in the seventh inning. Chicago outscored the Twins 32-10 during the series to pick up two games in the standings.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10585_News_1>\"There’s no way we’re going to sit here and speak glowingly about the way we just played. We won one out of four of these games, and we had ambitions to do a lot more than that,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"That being said, I think it was a first half that was mostly good baseball, but we do have work to do.\"Lowering his ERA to 2.15 with his fifth scoreless start of the season, Cease struck out eight to become the fastest pitcher in White Sox history to record 500 career strikeouts. He got there in 399 1/3 innings, well ahead of seven-time All-Star Chris Sale (472 1/3).Tim Anderson's two-out, two-strike, two-run single gave Chicago the lead in the fifth inning against Twins starter Chris Archer (2-4), who was cruising in his return from the 15-day injured list for left hip tightness until a two-out walk to Seby Zavala.Vaughn followed with a two-run double four batters later to prompt Baldelli to pull Archer.\"He had his stuff working,\" Vaughn said, \"and then his stuff stopped.\"The White Sox then roughed up right-hander Joe Smith in a six-run seventh inning with a two-run homer by Moncada, a solo drive by Vaughn and a three-run homer by Harrison. The 38-year-old Smith did not allow an earned run in his first 16 appearances of the season. In 14 games since May 23, Smith has surrendered 23 hits, 16 runs and six homers.The defending division champion White Sox were one of baseball's most egregious first-half underachievers, having not been above the .500 mark since May 25. They're 11-7 in July, though, and looking every bit the a formidable challenger to a Twins club that has been in first place for all but one day since April 24 when they finished a three-game sweep of the White Sox.\"Good teams are going to lose games,\" Archer said. \"What I like most about this first half is we haven’t played our best baseball and we’re in the position that we’re in.\"NEVER CEASING TO AMAZECease has been the rock of a rotation featuring past All-Star picks Johnny Cueto, Lucas Giolito and Lance Lynn. He leads the AL in strikeouts. In his last 10 starts, Cease has logged 58 innings with 79 strikeouts and just 34 hits and three earned runs allowed.\"I don't know how he's not in the All-Star game,\" designated hitter José Abreu said through a team translator. \"It's crazy.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10585_News_2>WITH HONORSThe White Sox had closer Liam Hendriks added to the All-Star team in the last wave of substitutions for injuries and weekend starting pitching.

Baltimore finished off the game to chants of \"Let’s Go O’s!\" at Wrigley Field, where the Orioles were playing their first series since 2014.\"We feel every bit of Birdland, especially here,\" Watkins said. \"You have ‘O’ chants going on in Wrigley Field. That’s pretty cool.\"The Cubs lost their sixth consecutive game, their longest skid since dropping 10 straight games June 4-16.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10604_News_1>Watkins (3-1) limited the Cubs to four hits in five-plus innings. Watkins is 3-0 with a 1.19 ERA in his last four starts since being recalled from Triple-A Norfolk on June 25. He allowed a single to Ian Happ to start the sixth and was lifted in favor of Dillion Tate.\"Spenser was fantastic,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"He set the tone. He put zeroes up early.\"Tate, Cionel Perez, Joey Krehbiel and Bryan Baker combined to allow two hits the rest of the way.\"We’re pitching with confidence,\" Hyde said. \"We’re aggressive. We’re pitching with emotion. I think our pitching has really turned the corner.\"Meanwhile, Cubs starter Justin Steele (3-6) — pitching on eight days rest after his girlfriend gave birth Monday to the couple’s first child — retired the final 11 batters he faced over six innings.\"The best of my life,\" Steele said of the last few days. \"Becoming a dad was just so special. Bawled my eyes out as soon as it happened. We decided on the name, Beau. Literally so ready to get back home to him right now and just love on him.\"But the damage was done in the first two innings. Three of the first four batters reached base, prompting pitching coach Tommy Hottovy to make a mound visit after Santander’s double. But Austin Hays followed with a single, and Santander scored after left fielder Happ misplayed the hit.The Orioles extended their lead in the second when Trey Mancini hit a double to score Rougned Odor and Cedric Mullins, who was initially ruled to have beaten the relay throw from shortstop Nico Hoerner to catcher Willson Contreras. But a replay overturned the safe call on Mullins, and Steele got Ryan Mountcastle to ground to short to end the inning.The Cubs scored their lone run off Watkins in the fifth when Christopher Morel tripled and scored on a sacrifice fly by Rafael Ortega.The Orioles added three runs with two outs in the eighth on a double by Adley Rutschman, a single by Odor and a balk by reliever Daniel Norris.HENDRICKS OUT INDEFINITELYCubs ace Kyle Hendricks will need at least two or three weeks before he can consider playing catch, manager David Ross said.

The Braves haven't lost consecutive games since June 17-18. They are 30-9 since June 1, best in the major leagues over that span.Atlanta had one hit against Mets starter David Peterson before Olson crushed a slider 426 feet to straightaway center field, the 14th time he’s gone deep this year. Peterson had retired 14 of 15 batters before he walked Dansby Swanson with one out in the sixth. Olson, the next batter, made it 2-1.\"Looking back on it, I don't feel like I've been locked in or that everything has totally clicked for me yet, so with that being said, I'm happy to have something to show for it,\" said Olson, who leads the majors with 33 doubles and began the day tied for fourth with 46 extra-base hits. \"There's definitely some room for improvement, but we're winning games and that's the name of the game.\"Duvall connected off Seth Lugo with a 412-foot shot to the second level of seats in left field, putting Atlanta up 4-1 after Travis d’Arnaud singled.

Boston scored one in the third, three in the fifth to tie it, one in the sixth to take the lead and four insurance runs in the seventh.It was the second straight comeback sparked by Downs, a 23-year-old rookie named after former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter who was supposed to start in Triple-A on Saturday but was scratched so he could head to Fenway Park.\"We play in a tough division, and we’ve been getting beat in the division and we know that,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. \"But we feel like we can play with anybody.\"J.D. Martinez hit a two-run homer to make it 6-all in the fifth, and Franchy Cordero and Christian Vazquez also homered.Giancarlo Stanton and Matt Carpenter homered for the Yankees, who scored two runs off Boston starter Nick Pivetta in each of the first three innings to open a 6-2 lead.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10624_News_1>Vazquez hit a solo homer in the bottom of the third, then doubled home a run in the fifth; Martinez hit the next pitch out to right-center to tie it 6-all. Chapman (0-3), who returned from the Injured List earlier this month, loaded the bases in the sixth on a single and two walks.Downs pinch hit for Jarren Duran and blooped one toward center field. LeMahieu went back on it from second base and Aaron Hicks came in from center, but the ball glanced off LeMahieu’s glove and fell in.Trevor Story scored from third to make it 7-6 but Rob Refsnyder, who held up at first, was forced out at second.\"Everybody talks about the bullpen, how great they are, and we saw the window there,\" said Cora, who used two pinch hitters in the inning against Chapman. \"We have to go for it there.\"Boston added four more in the seventh, loading the bases on an error, a walk and a single before Story doubled high off the Green Monster in left-center to clear the bases. Albert Abreu replaced Miguel Castro and committed a throwing error on Cordero’s bunt, allowing Story to score from second and make it 10-6.Chapman was charged with one run on one hit and two walks, striking out two in one inning. Hirokazu Sawamura (1-1) struck out two in two innings for Boston, which is in second place in the AL East — but 14 games behind the Yankees.\"At the end of the day, they’re going to look at who has the most wins, not the one who has the most wins against the division,\" Bogaerts said. \"So that’s the only way you get to the playoffs now.\"BOONE BOOTEDYankees manager Aaron Boone was ejected by plate umpire Tripp Gibson in the middle of the seventh.

{"title": "Yankees obliterate Pirates; Aaron Judge and Aaron Hicks both hit grand slams", "body": "Aaron Judge felt like he was \"stuck\" on 29 home runs for \"a while.\"Of course, \"a while\" is a relative term when it comes to the New York Yankees slugger. What Judge considered a drought of sorts was in reality a span of four games.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10632_News_0>One mighty swing put Judge back on track and helped the Yankees start the second half of their schedule with a bang.Judge sent a laser to the seats in left field in the eighth inning for his third career grand slam — and 30th homer of the season, most in the majors — as New York drilled the Pittsburgh Pirates 16-0 on Wednesday night to split their two-game interleague set.Aaron Hicks added a grand slam of his own an inning later on a night when the Yankees hit six home runs in all to push their team total to a major league-leading 139.Giancarlo Stanton, Josh Donaldson, Joey Gallo and Kyle Higashioka also homered for New York to back Luis Severino.\"Games like this help guys get rolling,\" Judge said. \"Guys had good at-bats, put a couple of balls in the gaps and all of a sudden guys take off for a week or two or a whole month or even the rest of the season.\"It's a zone Judge has seemingly been in since opening day. Hours after Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner admitted it may take a record contract to keep Judge from hitting free agency next winter, the outfielder looked worth every penny. He finished with three of New York's season-high 22 hits while becoming the first Yankees player to reach the 30-homer plateau before the All-Star break twice in his career.It's a number that left New York manager Aaron Boone shaking his head.\"It’s hard for me to relate to that,\" said Boone, who never hit more than 26 home runs in a season during his 12-year career. \"So it’s been pretty impressive, whatever — halfway in here — the kind of baseball he’s playing. Obviously the power has been right there.\"Hicks cleared the bases in the ninth when he went deep against Pirates utility infielder Josh VanMeter, who was making his third relief appearance of the season.\"It feels like any one of those guys could hit a homer at any point,\" VanMeter said. \"You just go out there and throw strikes and whatever happens happens, really. You’re not out there competing. You’re just trying to save some pitchers’ arms and pick them up.\"Severino (5-3) allowed four hits over six dominant innings, striking out three without a walk to pick up his first victory in more than a month. The right-hander retired 12 straight and 18 of the final 20 hitters he faced after giving up a single to Ke'Bryan Hayes and a double to Bryan Reynolds to begin the bottom of the first.The victory ended a two-game skid for New York, which began the second half of the season with the same recipe that carried the Yankees to the best record in the majors and the second-best start in franchise history through 81 games: dominant starting pitching and plenty of power.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10632_News_1>After using some small ball to take a 2-0 lead in the fourth thanks in part to a hit-and-run and a stolen base, Donaldson and Gallo took Mitch Keller (2-6) deep twice in the span of three pitches in the sixth to break it open.New York was just getting started, adding one in the seventh, then five in the eighth and six in the ninth to improve to 3-3 on a four-city, 10-game road trip.\"It’s tough to hold this lineup down,\" Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. \"You don’t see it happen very often. They score a bunch of runs and (Judge) is the catalyst for that.\"Reynolds had two of Pittsburgh's four hits but the Pirates could muster little against Severino and three New York relievers.Keller worked in and out of trouble over six innings, allowing four runs on a season-high 10 hits with a walk and seven strikeouts. He was long gone by the time New York overwhelmed Pittsburgh's overtaxed bullpen.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10632_News_2>TRAINER'S ROOMYankees: Held 1B Anthony Rizzo out of the lineup for a second straight game due to back stiffness.

Picollo and manager Mike Matheny expect his big bat to be in the lineup regularly.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10665_News_0>\"When I was growing up, I had a dream of playing professional baseball. But I just enjoy playing the game,\" said Pasquantino, who was doing his laundry when he learned of his big league call-up. \"I still do now, and I'm going to continue to try to do that as we move forward. I just love playing the game.\"The Royals optioned Mills, a 27-year-old relief pitcher, to Triple-A Omaha while designating right-hander Ronald Bolaños for assignment. Fleming, a 23-year-old with starting potential, was assigned to Class-A Quad Cities.\"We’ve been talking with teams the last couple of weeks getting into the middle of June and starting to get into that trade deadline. Carlos’ name was coming up pretty frequently,\" Picollo said. \"Over the weekend a couple of teams picked up their interest. Last night we thought we had a deal in place. It was just a matter of dotting T’s and crossing I’s today.\"This is the second time Santana has been with Seattle, though the first lasted a mere 10 days. He was acquired along with J.P. Crawford from Philadelphia for infielder Jean Segura, right-hander Juan Nicasio, and left-hander James Pazos on Dec. 3, 2018; the Mariners then traded him away as part of a three-team deal with Cleveland and Tampa Bay.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10665_News_1>This time should be different for the 36-yeart-old Santana, who hit 19 homers in 158 games for Kansas City last season but was hitting just .216 with four homers through 52 games this season. The Mariners were in search of a switch-hitter and an option at first base with leading hitter Ty France on the injured list with an elbow injury.Santana has been better at the plate over the last month, hitting .357 with a 1.032 OPS in June, and that made him enticing to the Mariners, who will pay $1.5 million of the remainder of his salary in the second year of a two-year, $17.5 million deal. Kansas City will pay Seattle $4,269,231.\"We had Carlos. He was a Mariner. Every time I see Carlos, I joke with him about that,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"I said, ‘You’re the favorite player I’ve ever managed.’ So he likes it and we have a good time with it. But obviously, he’s a tremendous clubhouse guy, really good teammate. Switch hitter. He gets on base as well as he ever has.\"Servais said the move doesn't necessarily mean that the injury to France is more severe than first thought.\"He’s in the batting cage today, swung a little with the right hand, and then a fungo to feel what it would feel like to extend with his left and we’re three or four days into this,\" Servais said. \"He knows what he means to our team and our lineup and all these other things. So we’ll just have to wait and see, but all indications are right now that I’m optimistic maybe he can be back at the end of the 10 days. But we’ll see.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10665_News_2>With the Royals last in the AL Central at 26-45 heading into Monday night's game against Texas, and Santana nearing the end of his contract, it was prudent for Kansas City to clear the way for Pasquantino to begin his big league career.The 24-year-old was picked in the 11th round of the 2019 first-year player draft out of Old Dominion and was generally one of the Royals' overlooked prospects until the past couple of seasons. Dubbed the \"Italian Nightmare\" by Hall of Famer George Brett in spring training, Pasquantino was hitting .280 with 18 homers this season at Omaha, and he was among the Triple-A leaders in extra-base hits, runs, homers and slugging percentage.\"I’m excited to be in the clubhouse every day and see what everybody’s about,\" said Pasquantino, who joins top prospect Bobby Witt Jr. and catcher MJ Melendez among a wave of rookie position players in Kansas City.\"I’m coming into a clubhouse with some established veterans and I’m excited to learn from those guys,\" he said.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10665_News_3>Mills had a 4.15 ERA in eight appearances for Seattle this season, along with going 1-0 with a 1.83 ERA in 19 2/3 innings for Triple-A Tacoma.

{"title": "Shohei Ohtani sets career-high in strikeouts; dazzles in victory over the Royals", "body": "Shohei Ohtani adheres to strict routine in nearly every aspect of his life. When his latest mound start was delayed 12 minutes by a pregame ceremony honoring the Angels' 2002 World Series champions, his meticulous preparation took a hit before he even threw a pitch.A slightly bumpy beginning still led to a second straight incredible night for the two-way superstar.Ohtani struck out a career-high 13 over eight dominant innings of two-hit ball, and the AL MVP also reached base three times in Los Angeles' 5-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10678_News_0>After giving up two singles to start that delayed first inning, Ohtani (6-4) retired 16 straight Royals and 23 of the final 24 batters he faced. While matching the longest start of his major league career, he allowed just one baserunner over his final seven innings — on a walk that was quickly erased by a double play.\"I think the biggest thing was putting up that zero in the first inning after giving up those first two hits,\" Ohtani said through his translator. \"I was able to do that, and it set the tone for the game. I wanted to go as long as I could, but I wasn’t really thinking about the pitch count early in the game.\"With the backdrop of a rare Southern California lightning storm illuminating the sky far beyond center field at the Big A, Ohtani also had a single and two walks at the plate in his latest electrifying two-way performance.One night after Ohtani hit two three-run homers and drove in a career-high eight runs in an extra-inning loss, he set a new personal best for strikeouts by fanning Emmanuel Rivera on his 108th and final pitch.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10678_News_1>\"He just put us on his back,\" Angels interim manager Phil Nevin said. \"I thought about taking him out going into the eighth, and he was adamant: ‘No. This is mine. I’m staying.' ... What a day. What a performance by him.\"David MacKinnon got his first major league hit with an RBI single in the seventh for the Angels, who avoided a series sweep with their fourth victory in six games overall. Luis Rengifo had an RBI double in the seventh before scoring on that single to right by MacKinnon, who got his first career RBI two innings earlier with a sacrifice fly.After scoring 18 runs in the previous two games at Angel Stadium, the Royals were shut out for the second time in four days and the 10th time this season. Kansas City still has won five of seven.\"That was a display,\" Royals manager Mike Matheny said. \"It’s a very unique repertoire of pitches. I don’t think you’re going to find as many guys with as many weapons as what we saw today. He was throwing three different sliders, plus a cutter and a curve. When the split started going, that’s when the strikeouts really started to happen, and he’s got 100 (mph) in the tank that he hardly ever showed. ... It’s going to be a tough day at the plate.\"Ohtani is unbeatable on the mound lately, allowing just one run in his last 20 innings over three starts. In his most recent home start two weeks ago, he pitched seven innings of one-run ball and also homered in a victory that snapped the Angels' franchise-record 14-game skid.Whit Merrifield and Andrew Benintendi singled in the Royals’ first two at-bats against Ohtani, but he subsequently set down every batter he faced until Merrifield drew a one-out walk in the sixth — and Benintendi quickly grounded into a double play.Ohtani’s fastball topped 99 mph twice in the second half of his start while he baffled Kansas City, getting a whopping 34 combined strikes on swing-and-misses or called strikes.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10678_News_2>Daniel Lynch (3-7) wasn't as effective for the Royals early on, but the left-hander resourcefully shut down the Angels until they loaded the bases in the fifth on two walks and an infield single. Lynch, who left after MacKinnon's sacrifice fly, gave up three hits and five walks on a career-high 104 pitches.Mike Trout got a rest day for the Angels, leaving their struggling lineup decidedly lacking punch. But MacKinnon came through as the team's improbable cleanup hitter, getting first major league hit after getting called up last weekend for his MLB debut.MacKinnon was pleased by his breakthrough swings, but other aspects of the game also thrilled him.\"I got to play the field behind Shohei and see how good he is,\" MacKinnon said. \"It's crazy being here.\"TRAINER'S ROOMRoyals: C Salvador Perez sat out after reinjuring his left thumb on a swing Tuesday night, but Matheny said the team is still determining the seriousness of the injury after an MRI exam.Angels: RHP Jimmy Herget went on the 15-day injured list with a right shoulder impingement. Right-handers Elvis Peguero and Oliver Ortega came up from Triple-A Salt Lake, while inconsistent rookie Reid Detmers went down just six starts after throwing a no-hitter.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10678_News_3>UP NEXTRoyals: Zack Greinke is expected to come off the injured list Friday to start when Kansas City opens a three-game weekend series at home against Oakland.

You know, it makes the game feel authentic, makes it feel real,\" said Ronaldo Echeverria, a Las Vegas Aviators fan.But umpires make human errors, so MLB introduced an automated ball and strike system to increase the accuracy of calls and reduce delays.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10687_News_1>\"I think people have the misconception that it's going to be a robot behind the plate. ‘Lost in Space’ is one of my favorite shows. It’s not the robot from ‘Lost in Space’ back there,\" Jim Gemma, the Aviators' media relations director, told Fox News Digital. \"The umpire is going to have AirPods in, and the ball comes over… That basically tells them instantly if it's a ball or strike.\"Cameras located at the top of the bleachers detect the strike zone based on the players’ height.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10687_News_2>Once it determines whether the pitch was a ball or strike, a robotic voice tells the umpire through an earpiece. was first introduced in July 2019 in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.It’s now reached the top of the minor leagues, and the majors could be next. \"At the core, sport is a human endeavor, and we like to cheer for our fans.

{"title": "MLB legend Mike Piazza still feels excitement for Opening Day, recalls fond memories", "body": "Major League Baseball’s Opening Day is officially here.After months of the owners and the players’ union going back and forth, the two sides came to an agreement to start Opening on April 7 and play a full 162-game season.For Baseball Hall of Famer Mike Piazza, the excitement is still there.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10954_News_0>Piazza, who played 16 seasons in the big leagues with the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Oakland Athletics and five games with the Florida Marlins, was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania – about 21 miles northwest of Philadelphia. He grew up watching the Phillies and got into the old Veterans Stadium to watch the team way back when.\"Definitely excitement,\" he told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. \"I think it’s definitely in your blood. Once you’re a professional player, Opening Day is always a celebration and sort of a spirit of renewal and everybody’s in first place. A lot of optimism. As a kid I remember many experiences going to Opening Day down at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia and watching like the crazy things the Phillies would do like kite man and certain other things. It’s a celebration, no question.\"Piazza broke into the league in 1992 as a catcher for the Dodgers and got his first taste of Opening Day with Los Angeles in 1993. He said he remembered played in the old Joe Robbie Stadium when the Dodgers played the Marlins on April 5, 1993. He went 1-for-4 in that game but later went onto win the National League Rookie of the Year award.He said that part of what was \"cool\" for him was playing around the area he went to high school. He said he had been in South Florida since he was out of high school. He also mentioned the excitement around the 1999 Mets and playing on Opening Day for them was a fun experience as well.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10954_News_1>\"One Opening Day was my rookie in ’93. It was the first game in the Marlins’ history. It was at then I think it was Joe Robbie Stadium then it became Pro Player and now it’s Hard Rock Stadium. That was kind of interesting. Obviously, the new franchise in Florida, even though it’s not an older franchise they’ve had some really good success in their history. And being a South Florida resident since I graduated high school it was kind of cool for me,\" Piazza told Fox News Digital.\"And then, of course, Opening Day I think in ‘99, was basically my first full year with the Mets which was pretty cool because we were obviously expected to have a good team and there was a lot of anticipation, a lot of excitement and it’s always good to get off to a good start, even though it’s one game. It’s always nice to have a good Opening Day and get a couple hits or have a good start to the season.\"Some of the rules going into the 2022 season are a bit different.Among them is MLB's adoption of the universal designated hitter, which means National League teams will have the position for the first time in history. Piazza was primarily a catcher during his career and would get the chance to play the DH position during interleague play. He was only really accustomed to it toward the end of his career with the Athletics. He played 73 games as DH in 2007.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10954_News_2>Piazza told Fox News Digital he wasn’t really a fan of the universal DH because it wasn’t something he was playing with during his career. He did say he could see it creating more interest for fans.\"To be honest, I’m not a major fan of it. I think as a player it was nice because the American League used the DH. So, when we started interleague play, I was able to take advantage of it as a player and occasionally sort of get rest from having to catch to play nine innings behind the plate,\" Piazza said. \"But personally, it’s not that I’m against it or negative towards it, it’s just something I don’t relate to. I guess being sort of a National League guy my whole [career] and having an American League season at the end of my career. And, of course, there was always some good hitting pitchers now that won’t be able to hit. So look, let’s just say I’m not a fan but it is what it is. I mean, I think it's not going to make the game any more or less interesting. I think it's just going to sort of what's just, I guess, maybe create a little bit more interest from a fan perspective. But as a player, I always like kind of the pitchers having to bunt and do things with the bat that can help themselves, help their game, which I always thought was kind of cool.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10954_News_3>Piazza said having the DH in both leagues may make the manager’s job a bit less stressful.\"It makes the manager’s job a little less stressful because basically you don’t have to worry about, unless God forbid, somebody gets hurt or something like that in the defense and then you kind of have to juggle the lineup a little bit,\" he said. \"I had a small experience managing international baseball and with the DH you don’t have to worry about double switching or even pinch-hitting a pitcher who may be throwing a good game or not throwing a good game. It kind of does alleviate a bit of the press on the manager, in my opinion.\"Thursday’s Opening Day will feature only a handful of games because of some rain plaguing areas of the country.

Now, the controversy over the trade has prompted one prominent sports family with ties to Cleveland to draw a \"line in the sand.\" Andrea Thome, the wife of Cleveland Indians legend Jim Thome, has decided to cancel the family's Browns season tickets.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10970_News_0>Thome announced on Twitter Friday that she was canceling the tickets on the same day that the Browns held a press conference to introduce Watson and address the controversy surrounding the trade and his lawsuits. \"Officially cancelled our Browns season tickets today and asked for a refund as they were paid in full,\" Thome wrote. \"Very sad after 40 years as a fan, but this is my line in the sand. I believe women. Especially when there are 22 of them. That press conference did nothing to change my mind.\"During the press conference, Watson answered multiple questions about the validity of the allegations and repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. When asked if he would be open to counseling, Watson said: \"I don’t have a problem.\"\"I understand the whole circumstance is very difficult, especially for the women’s side — the fans in this community. I’m not naive to that,\" Watson said of the criticism his trade has drawn. \"I know these allegations are very, very serious, but like I mentioned before, I’ve never assaulted any woman.

That’s not me as a person and that’s not how I was raised.\"If the Browns don't offer a refund, Thome said she plans to auction off the tickets and publicly donate the money to different women's crisis charities in northeast Ohio.\"They may not give us a refund. But I sent the letter today. If @Browns won’t refund—-I will auction off every single game and publicly donate every cent to different women’s crisis charities in N.E. Ohio, raising awareness week by week during the season,\" she wrote. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski on Monday said he expects Watson to participate fully in the team's offseason program beginning April 18.Speaking at the NFL owners' meetings in Palm Beach, Florida, Stefanski said the team has been welcoming of Watson despite his off-the-field issues, and the coach noted he will try and make sure those issues don't distract the team. <IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_10970_News_2>\"I think that’s important for our players, coaches and our building in general,’’ Stefanski said, according to the . \"We understand that there are questions, and we’re going to continue to have that dialogue. But at the end of the day, we also have our work to do. We have to focus on that. … You have to be present and be where your feet are. That will really be our approach to everything.\"Amid the backlash for hiring Watson, Stefanski said his team has tried to be \"understanding of everybody's viewpoint.\"\"I want to just make sure that I’m available in our building to everyone to talk through because it’s not something that was taken lightly,\" the coach added.It’s just too important. I wanted to make sure that everybody understood that this is something that took weeks, months, weeks of gathering information, of discussions and conversations. It’s not something we could take lightly.\"The trade for Watson, who agreed to a five-year, $230 million contract with the Browns, likely spells the end of the Baker Mayfield era.

{"title": "MLB teams' pursuit of the postseason comes down to final 2 weeks of season", "body": "There are two weeks remaining in the MLB regular season, and the American and National League divisional and wild-card races are hotly contested battles that might not be decided until Oct. 3.Only three National League teams have clinched playoff spots. The Milwaukee Brewers have nearly wrapped up the National League Central division, while the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers have playoff spots but are still battling it out for the National League West crown.Each division leader in the American League – Tampa Bay Rays, Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros – have comfortable leads, but only the White Sox are ahead by double digits. The Rays control the American League East up 6.5 games, while the Oakland Athletics are 6 games behind the Astros.There are a handful of teams who are competing for five playoff spots in both leagues.Read below for a look at the teams who are still in contention as of Monday.-<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_11583_News_0>: The Red Sox are sitting in second place in the AL East, 6.5 games back of the Rays. As of Monday, they are one of the two teams in the wild card spot but are only two games ahead of the Yankees in the loss column. Boston has a series with the Yankees starting Sept. 24 that could determine the fate of both teams’ playoff hopes.: The White Sox are on the cusp of clinching the AL Central. The team has not won a division title since 2008. The White Sox have a five-game series with the Indians later in the week but could clinch the division with a series victory over the Tigers, which begins Monday.: The Astros are looking to pick up their fourth division title in five years. The team is 6 games up on the Athletics, and barring a catastrophe, the team could clinch the AL West in the next few days. Houston has two huge divisional series against the Angels and the A’s this week followed by a potential playoff preview against the Rays. Houston plays Oakland in the final series of the season.: The Yankees have slipped toward the end of the season and their play isn’t conducive to what a playoff team should be. The Yankees start Monday 1.5 games behind the Blue Jays for the final playoff spot. The team needs a convincing series against the Rangers and then somehow needs to get victories on the road against Boston and Toronto. The team wraps up 2021 against the Rays.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_11583_News_1>: The A’s have been hanging tough all season long. The team is only 2 games behind the Blue Jays for the final wild card spot, and the end of the season will provide it the best chance to get into the playoffs. Oakland plays Seattle to start the week in a series that could damage the playoff hopes of both teams. Oakland then hosts Houston with potential momentum from the Mariners series. Oakland finishes the season with road series against both teams again.: Much like the A’s, the Mariners have been clinging to the wild card race all season, and two huge series could be a boon for them. Seattle enters Monday only 4 games behind the Blue Jays for the final wild card spot. The Mariners have not been to the playoffs since 2001. Here’s how the final series play out: on the road vs. Oakland and Los Angeles and then hosting both teams to end the season.T: The Rays have been electric allseason long. Tampa Bay enters Monday in first place in the AL East and nearing its second consecutive division title. To hang on to that, the Rays must stay strong in series against the Jays, Miami Marlins, Houston and finally the Yankees.: The Jays have two of the best players in the AL in Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Marcus Semien but are in danger of missing the playoffs. Toronto is holding onto a 1.5-game lead in the final AL wild card spot. Crucial play down the stretch is going to be important. Toronto starts Monday on the road against Tampa Bay and then against the Minnesota Twins. The team ends the season at home with the Yankees in town and the Baltimore Orioles.-<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_11583_News_2>: The Braves start Monday in first place in the NL East division and are in no position to take their foot off the gas pedal. They only have a 2-game lead over the Phillies and a 5.5-game lead over the Mets. Nothing is set in stone for Atlanta. The team has a four-game set against the Arizona Diamondbacks and then huge series against the Padres and Phillies. To end the season, Atlanta will host the Mets in a series that could determine some playoff positioning.: The Reds have been the surprise of the 2021 season and are fighting hard with the Cardinals to fight for the wild card spot. Cincinnati is 3 games behind St. Louis for the final wild card spot. The team should be able to secure wins over the Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Nationals at home this week and will hit the road for a series against the White Sox at the end of the month. The Reds wrap up the season against the Pirates.: The Rockies are under .500 but are not exactly dead in the water just yet. Colorado is 9.5 games behind the Cardinals and still has a very outside chance of putting together a winning streak to get into contention. The Rockies will have a nine-game home stretch starting Tuesday, beginning with a series against the Dodgers, and end the season on the road against the Diamondbacks.: Like the Rockies, the Mets aren’t dead in the water either. New York is only 5.5 games behind Atlanta for the NL East crown and 7.5 in back of the Cardinals for the final wild card spot. The Mets have a tough schedule, with a two-game series starting Tuesday against the Red Sox on the road, and they stay on the road against the Brewers at the end of the week. The Mets finish September at home against the Marlins and then a pivotal series against the Braves.: Don’t look now, but the Phillies are also in striking distance of a division title. The team is only 2 games in back of the Braves in the division title race and 3.5 games behind St. Louis for the wild card. With Bryce Harper competing for an NL MVP, Philly can gain some ground with upcoming series against the Orioles and Pirates. It will lead into a crucial series on the road against Atlanta and end with the final series against the Marlins.: The Padres have had a dramatic fall from grace but aren’t out of contention just yet. San Diego is behind the Phillies in the wild card standings and will need to have big wins against the Giants, Braves and Dodgers to even sniff a chance at the playoffs. San Diego’s chances could possibly come down to a road series against the Giants in October.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_11583_News_3>: The pressure is on the Cardinals. They hold the key to the final wild card spot and could see their 3.5-game lead slip away if things don’t go right. St. Louis has won 10 of its last 11 games and begins a big series against the Brewers Monday. St. Louis plays Milwaukee twice in the next few days along with the Cubs. There would be nothing more the Cubs would like to do than ruin their rival’s chances of making the playoffs. The rivalry series will end the 2021 season.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/mlb-teams-pursuit-postseason-final-2-weeks-season", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_11583_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Toronto Blue Jays' Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits a home run against the New York Yankees during the ninth inning of a baseball game Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021, in New York.

{"title": "MLB's Field of Dreams game ends in Hollywood fashion -- with a walk-off homer, fireworks", "body": "MLB's Field of Dreams game ended in Hollywood fashion on Thursday night. Chicago White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson crushed a two-run homer off New York Yankees pitcher Zack Britton in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the White Sox a thrilling 9-8 walk-off win. \"A #walkoff into the corn at #MLBatFieldofDreams. Couldn't write a better script,\" the MLB tweeted. The Yankees had taken an 8-7 lead before the Hollywood ending, which saw Anderson circle the bases as fireworks exploded. \"The game's never over 'til it's over,\" he said after the game, according to The Athletic. \"I knew what I was looking for and I didn't miss. Let's go home.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12042_News_0>The city of Dyersville, Iowa, hosted the \"Field of Dreams\" game, which also served as the first-ever regular-season MLB game played on Iowa soil.\"Field of Dreams,\" the 1989 Kevin Costner flick, was filmed in Dyersville. In the iconic movie, Costner plays Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer who hears a voice telling him, \"If you build it, he will come.\" Kinsella then proceeds to builds a baseball diamond on his land.The well-kept movie set was steps away from the stadium built to hold 8,000 fans for Thursday night, and designed to resemble Chicago's old Comiskey Park. Costner came back for the game, stealing the scene with a slow, ponderous stroll into the outfield his character Ray Kinsella often took in the film before stopping to watch the real White Sox and Yankees emerge from the corn for pregame introductions.Clutching a ball in his hand, while the original symphonic score from the movie played over the loudspeakers, Costner stepped up to a microphone and told the crowd, \"It's perfect.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12042_News_1>There were rows upon rows of corn between the two outfields, in fact. Yes, it's the same spot where Shoeless Joe Jackson and his pals appeared — and disappeared — throughout the Academy Award-nominated film about fathers, children, culture, self-discovery, ghosts, and, oh, yeah, baseball.\"As a kid you dream of the chance to play Major League Baseball and you watch certain movies or heroes in comic books and fairytales, and getting a chance to actually be at the Field of Dreams and play a game here and have family and friends here and getting a chance to represent the Yankees here, never in my life did I think I'd ever experience this,\" Yankees star Aaron Judge said.Major leaguers can be particular about the details when they're on a road trip, desiring to maximize comfort and minimize intrusion for optimal performance on the field, but nobody minded any of the logistical hurdles of playing this game a four-hour drive from Chicago and about a half-hour ride from the airport in Dubuque where both teams flew in.White Sox closer Liam Hendriks was all smiles as he recounted his exploration of the white farmhouse where the Kinsella family lives in the movie that's been well-kept as a tourist attraction.Both teams had their fill of movie reenactment moments during pregame photo ops on the original field, before retreating into the corn and returning to the regulation stadium to prepare for the game. The players were politely warned not to scrape their faces on the stalks and not to try to enter the maze — one of the fan attractions added to the site for the event — to avoid getting lost.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12042_News_2>\"Anyone who follows me on Instagram is going to be very sick of corn,\" said Hendriks, whose phone storage had filled up after all the photos and videos he recorded.Judge was born three years after \"Field of Dreams\" was released, but his father introduced him to the movie when he was a kid and he quickly became a big fan. He noted that some of his younger teammates had not yet seen the film.\"I think one of these nights we’re going to sit down and I’ll have a DVD for ’em, ready to go,\" Judge said with a wide smile.The film, naturally, remains a strong source of local pride, and Iowa residents were given purchasing priority when the limited amount of public tickets went on sale. The \"Field of Dreams Ghost Players,\" many of whom were extras in the film, gathered on the movie field in the afternoon in their 1919-style uniforms in honor of Jackson's \"Black Sox\" team that plays a key part in the plot.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12042_News_3>\"It’s given us a real identity. When you think of Dyersville, it’s \"Field of Dreams,\" and all the publicity we’ve been getting lately has just been tremendous for the town and the area,\" said Jude Milbert, one of the Ghost Players who developed a Globetrotters-style troupe after their involvement in the film by putting on youth clinics, doing comedy routines and traveling around the world as ambassadors of the game. They're all former college or semipro players who live in northeast Iowa.The Ghost Players and everyone else can get ready for more next year.\"You never mess with a winning streak, but it does feel like all the teams are going to want to touch this. There's going to be hot competition to play this,\" Costner said before the game.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/mlbs-field-of-dreams-game-ends-hollywood-fashion-walk-off-homer-fireworks", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_12042_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Chicago White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson (7) celebrates his walk-off home run against the New York Yankees in the ninth inning during a baseball game, Thursday, Aug. 12, 2021 in Dyersville, Iowa.

{"title": "Bystander waiting for Uber among those injured after DC gunfire sends Nationals game into chaos", "body": "Instead of a seventh-inning stretch, Saturday night's MLB game between the Washington Nationals and San Diego Padres had a sixth-inning scare.The game erupted into chaos after gunshots rang out near Nationals Park in Washington, causing players and fans to flee for safety.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12288_News_0>Videos of the incident quickly spread on social media with the Nationals' Twitter account confirming gunshots outside the stadium. Players and fans could be seen running for cover.One bystander attending the game was injured while waiting for an Uber, FOX 5 reported. She was taken to the hospital when non life-threatening injuries.No arrests had been made in connection to the shooting as of Sunday evening. Mayor Muriel Bowser said in joint statement with the Washington Nationals that the incident occurred after a dispute \"between individuals in two vehicles.\"\"Something crazy going on at Nationals Park,\" Boston Globe sportswriter Ben Volin tweeted Saturday night. \"Players just sprinted off the field and fans running from the stands.\"At a news conference late Saturday, D.C. Metropolitan Police confirmed that three people were struck by gunfire outside the stadium, after initial reports said four people had been struck.Police believe the incident was a confrontation between occupants of two vehicles that were traveling near the stadium, FOX 5 of Washington reported.One of the vehicles linked to the shooting was later located by investigators, police said, according to the station.None of those wounded suffered life-threatening injuries, a police source told Fox News. The identities of those wounded remained unclear.Police stressed that no gunfire occurred inside the stadium, according to FOX 5.During the confusion inside the stadium, Padres stars Fernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado opened a gate to the field area so that some frightened fans could seek refuge in the team's dugout, Andrew Golden of the Washington Post wrote on Twitter.Tatis was among the players posting later on Twitter about his concern for the fans.\"Hope everyone is safe!\" Tatis wrote. \"Just keep the prayers up … thank you everyone that help in the front line ! God bless.\"The stadium was not evacuated. Instead, fans were asked to shelter in place as police investigated, FOX 5 reported. Investigators were reviewing all available security-camera footage and other evidence to glean more details about what happened, the station reported.The area near the stadium has seen a spike in gun violence recently, the police source said. Recent incidents have included an Uber driver being carjacked and killed by teenage suspects.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12288_News_1>The gunfire came just one night after a 6-year-old girl was killed by gunfire in the nation's capital, with five adults wounded in the same incident.The public-address announcer at the stadium told fans to stay inside the park.The game was in the sixth inning at the time of the incident.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12288_News_2>Just after 10 p.m., the Nationals posted a statement, saying the game had been suspended and would resume at 1:05 p.m. Sunday, followed by the game that was already scheduled for Sunday. The Padres were leading 8-4 when Saturday's game was interrupted.Police assured fans that the area will be safe for Sunday's game, FOX 5 reported.On Friday, reports emerged that White House press secretary Jen Psaki had been invited to toss out a ceremonial first pitch prior to Sunday's game at Nationals Park. There was no indication late Saturday that the plans would be changed.Psaki was invited because she is a graduate of the College of William and Mary, which is being honored at the ballpark Sunday, WRC-TV of Washington reported.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_12288_News_3>The Padres also tweeted, saying the club's thoughts were \"with everyone affected by the incident outside of Nationals Park.\"Earlier, the Nationals posted on Twitter that gunshots had been reported.

{"title": "National anthem protest guidelines in each major US sport", "body": "The concept of protesting during the national anthem didn't exactly originate with Colin Kaepernick, but when he did so to start the 2016 NFL season, he launched a movement that is ongoing to this day.Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in protest on the medals stand during the 1968 Olympics. They were initially ostracized and kicked out of the Games for their actions in response to threats from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban the entire team.Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf sparked controversy in the NBA when he refused to stand for the anthem, saying that, to him, the flag was a symbol of oppression. He was suspended initially but worked out a deal with the league to look down while standing as the anthem was played.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_0>Kaepernick would raise the issues of systemic racism and police brutality in giving his reasoning to kneel during the national anthem. He initially sat during the anthem, but after talking to former long snapper and Green Beret Nate Boyer, they agreed that kneeling would be a better route to take.Though the NFL never formally punished Kaepernick, the league’s team owners were accused of conspiring to blackball Kaepernick and teammate Eric Reid for launching the protests. The league would settle the accusations with Kaepernick and Reid, and while the defensive back would play again, the quarterback would still remain a free agent.Each major pro sports league has rules regarding player action during the national anthem. Here’s a look.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_1>The NFL has never formally disciplined a player or coach for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem. But the league rules state that team members \"shall stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem\" and those who don’t want to stand \"may stay in the locker room until after the anthem has been performed.\"The NFL agreed to delay any type of punishment, but the anthem and the presentation of the American flag before football games remains.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_2>Like the NFL, the NBA also has rules for how players and personnel should conduct themselves during the national anthem. In 2017, ESPN reported the NBA sent a memo to teams reminding them \"the league office will determine how to deal with any possible instance in which a player, coach or trainer does not stand for the anthem\" and that teams \"do not have the discretion to waive\" and the league can only discipline players who violate the mandate.But NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said this past summer that the rules for standing during the anthem wouldn’t be enforced amid a wave of racial tension in the U.S.\"I respect our teams’ unified act of peaceful protest for social justice and under these unique circumstances will not enforce our long-standing rule requiring standing during the playing of our national anthem,\" Silver said.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_3>Players kneeling during the anthem isn’t a common theme in baseball. Former Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Mathews started the trend in baseball after Kaepernick, but it didn’t catch on. In 2020, players were seen kneeling during the anthem at the beginning of the season, but it mostly tapered off.MLB’s guidelines allow for personal choice.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_4>NHL player protests are rare and the league doesn’t outline player behavior during the national anthem before games.In 2017, Tampa Bay Lightning forward J.T. Brown raised his fist before a game.In 2020, Minnesota’s Matt Dumba knelt during the anthem upon the league’s return to play. The Chicago Blackhawks’ Malcolm Subban and the Edmonton Oilers’ Darnell Nurse stood with hands on his shoulders.**The WNBA has been among the leaders in supporting social justice initiatives on the court. The league had the same rules as the NBA when it came to protesting during the anthem but declined to enforce it. When the league returned, some players chose not to participate in the anthem and instead stayed in the locker room while the song was playing.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_5>The National Women’s Soccer League beat the four major sports back to the field amid the coronavirus pandemic. The league allows players to express themselves how they see fit, whether it’s standing, kneeling or staying in the locker room during the anthem.The U.S. Soccer Federation changed its rules recently to allow players to kneel or protest during the anthem. The rule was made in 2017 after soccer star Megan Rapinoe became the first athlete to follow in Kaepernick’s footsteps and protest in solidarity with him.U.S. Soccer didn’t allow Rapinoe or any other player to kneel during the anthem during the World Cup. Rapinoe vowed to not put her hand over her heart as her form of protest and followed through.**Major League Soccer supports players in their actions to protest during the national anthem if they choose to. The league didn’t play the anthem during matches in its initial return because there were no fans in the stands.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/national-anthem-protest-guidelines-major-us-sports", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised black-gloved fists in the Black power salute in protest during the national anthem at the 1968 Mexico Games.", "id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/John-Carlos-1968.jpg"}, {"caption": "Eric Reid, left, kneeled during the national anthem with Colin Kaepernick, right, in 2016.", "id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_13666_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/nfl-kaepernick-reid.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Miami Heat team kneels during the playing of the national anthem before the first half of an NBA basketball game against the Miami Heat, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Miami.

{"title": "How the coronavirus pandemic affected sports in 2020", "body": "The only thing 2020 will be remembered for is how the coronavirus affected everyone and everything.The sports world in North America came to a complete halt because of the pandemic in March. Before Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the illness, the Golden State Warriors were already making plans to host games without fans at the Chase Center before the NBA was shut down.On March 11, things got real. The NBA suspended its entire season after Gobert tested positive. The Jazz were going to play the Oklahoma City Thunder at the Chesapeake Energy Arena when the game was canceled due to the positive test.It wasn’t even 24 hours after the cancelation when leagues began to take extensive precautionary measures to mitigate the potential spread of the virus as reported cases and deaths began to pick up.MLB canceled the rest of its spring training games, the NHL and MLS put a pause on their regular seasons, college sports, including the men's and women’s basketball tournaments, were canceled and the Olympics were postponed to 2021.Here’s a brief look at how each major North American sport was affected this year.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_0>While the major professional leagues were getting the praise for pulling off a season, the National Women’s Soccer League completed the bubble in Utah and had a championship before anyone else. The 23-game tournament kicked off in June, and though one team had to miss the entire tournament because of an outbreak, the league didn’t really have any issues getting things kicked off and played a short schedule in the fall.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_1>The NFL had to adjust a bit because of the pandemic but because everything started going downhill in March, the league didn’t have to push the start of its season back as medical professionals and league executives started to formulate a plan on how to have a season.The NFL Draft was conducted virtually for the first time ever. Practices and training camp were mostly done via video conference call as the health and safety protocols were worked on. Preseason and the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies were canceled. But games were not lost.Teams have dealt with several outbreaks and other organizations needed to be disciplined for not properly following the rules put into place. The NFL followed state rules in regards to allowing fans in stadiums. There have been fans present in some NFL stadiums this seasonThe league's season is nearing the finish line.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_2>MLB was forced to play an abbreviated season because of the coronavirus pandemic and the long negotiations between the league and the players’ union. But there was a first pitch, thrown by Dr. Anthony Fauci, and there was a World Series.The league was forced to improvise on some things – like a universal DH, expanded playoffs, a mostly regional schedule for teams and neutral sites for league championship series and the World Series. Some games were forced to be canceled or moved because of outbreaks, but it didn’t have a lasting effect on playoff positioning as some might have thought.Spring training for 2021 is expected to start on time.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_3>The NBA was the first league to hit pause on its regular season and it took a while for it to get back to the court. When it did, the league only allowed a few of the top teams in the bubble in Disney World and played a few games to get going before the playoffs.The league also allowed players to speak out on social injustices in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the Jacob Blake shooting. The NBA put Black Lives Matter on its court and allowed players to kneel during the national anthem without repercussion. The league also allowed players to wear a social justice message on the back of their jerseys.The NBA got through the season and the playoffs without having any canceled games because of the coronavirus. The league postponed games after players protested the police-involved shooting of Blake in Wisconsin. The movement trickled down to the WNBA and MLB.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_4>The WNBA played its entire regular season in a bubble in Florida. The WNBA had some issues with coronavirus and had some players opt out of the season over fears of the virus. But it didn’t force the league to cancel the season.The league also took on social justice initiatives throughout the season. The league created the WNBA/WNBPA Social Justice Council and launched The Justice Movement to \"be a driving force of necessary and continuing conversations about race, voting rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy, and gun control amongst other important societal issues.\"Out of all the professional sports leagues in North America, the WNBA has been the leader in raising awareness for social justice.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_5>There was almost a college football season without two of the five major conferences playing. The ACC, Big 12 and SEC were all set to play while the Big Ten and Pac-12 were initially not going to have a season. When things looked relatively OK for the three former conferences, the latter conferences decided to play. The coronavirus pandemic definitely affected the season when it comes down to it but games were played and the season is nearing the finish line.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_6>The NHL took its bubble into Canada, and with strict coronavirus guidelines the league was able to have a round-robin playoff tournament and the actual playoffs, ending with the Stanley Cup in September. The league didn’t report one coronavirus case, creating hub cities to host its playoff games. The league was criticized for coming back to play too early but managed to have its season anyway.\"The gauntlet that you have to run to hoist this trophy is unbelievable and even more unbelievable this year,\" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in September. \"These guys have been away from home for more than two months. This has been the ultimate team effort. This Stanley Cup run will go down in record books as perhaps the hardest run of all-time.\"**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_7>MLS returned to play with the \"MLS is Back\" Tournament in July after the season was shut down in March when it was through a few games. The league returned in a bubble at Disney World but it didn’t start out exactly great. FC Dallas and Nashville SC were forced to be left behind after their coronavirus outbreaks.The league still got through 51 matches with 24 of the 26 teams playing matches and the Portland Timbers ended the tournament as champions. MLS also had a season in the fall.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_8>Golf was one of the first major individual sports to return to play. The PGA Tour rolled with the punches when it came to golfers testing positive for the coronavirus. Several players were forced to skip tournaments while a bunch of international players stayed home.The TaylorMade Driving Relief tournament and Capital One’s The Match were the first two back in May, nearly two months after things shut down across the nation. Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson got the TaylorMade Driving Relief match set up while Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady played in Capital One's The Match: Champions for Charity. The first real tournament was the Charles Schwab Challenge and the first major was the PGA Championship.The Masters was played in November. The Open Championship was the only major not played and that was because of Britain’s own coronavirus rules.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_9>Professional tennis was sent into a tailspin when the coronavirus pandemic started to impact sports leagues everywhere. The ATP and WTA didn’t return to the courts until late August with the Western & Southern Open. The U.S. Open was held, as was the French Open. But there was no Wimbledon. A lot of other matches were canceled in between as well.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_10>UFC took a lot of heat for getting its pay-per-views and fights back on track quickly, but it was when Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje fought on May 9 that sports really returned. The fight took place in Jacksonville, Fla., and it was a card that also had Henry Cejudo and Francis Ngannou on it.UFC would conduct events without fans in Las Vegas and on Fight Island in Abu Dhabi. The promotion did it right and paved the way for other mixed martial arts promotions to get back on track as well.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_11>Men’s and women’s college basketball conference tournaments came to an abrupt halt in March. The coronavirus pandemic forced the cancelation of the NCAA basketball tournaments and fans had to wait until November for college basketball again. The NCAA set new rules in place with proper protocols as the 2020-21 season started up again.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_12>The 2020 Olympic Games were set to take place in Tokyo. But while there was hope the pandemic would have been over by the summer, the Games were eventually pushed back to 2021. Having the Games would have been a logistical nightmare since the virus wasn’t exactly under control.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_13>Horse Racing’s Triple Crown schedule was shifted all over the place but the show went on. The Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes all got underway this year. The Derby didn’t have fans in Kentucky, the Preakness didn’t have fans in Maryland and neither did the Belmont in New York.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News_14>The XFL had a promising first few weeks. The play was entertaining and fans were treated to football in the spring. It wasn’t the NFL, but it was enough to keep those starved for football after the Super Bowl to stay somewhat full. The pandemic, however, shut everything in the XFL down and it didn’t come back. The XFL was forced to cease operations. The league was sold to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Dany Garcia, giving it hope that it would be back eventually.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/coronavirus-pandemic-affected-sports-reaction", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_13777_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Houston Dash forward Rachel Daly holds the trophy alongside teammates as they celebrate their Challenge Cup championship win over the Chicago Red Stars, Sunday, July 26, 2020, in Sandy, Utah.

{"title": "In memoriam: Athletes and important sports figures who died in 2020", "body": "2020 has been the year that challenged us all. The sports community said its final farewells to some of its most iconic names, some taken from us too soon and too young. The impact of the deaths of Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna reached far beyond those who knew the significance of the No. 24 jersey, and as we near the one-year anniversary of their passing, their legacy continues to touch the lives of so many.The deaths of baseball greats like Whitey Ford, Bob Gibson, Lou Brock and Tom Seaver were bittersweet -- as fans mourned their loss, they also reminisced about the glory days of America’s favorite pastime.The Pro Football Hall of Fame said goodbye to some of its most legendary members including Don Shula, whose memory will no doubt live on in the legacy of the ‘72 Dolphins. As we head into the new year, here are just some of the sports figures we lost in 2020:<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_13773_News_0>Davis Stern was the longest-serving NBA commissioner, having sit from 1984 to 2014, and is credited with growing the league into the global phenomena that it is today.

{"title": "Pro athletes who stood for national anthem amid fever pitch to support social justice initiatives", "body": "Sports are back and professional athletes have turned to social justice activism during the national anthem to raise awareness on racial injustice and police brutality in the U.S.The movement started in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, started to kneel during the anthem after talking to former U.S. Green Beret, and former Seattle Seahawks player, Nate Boyer. The decision to kneel started a firestorm across the league and even reached the upper echelon of the White House.While kneeling during the anthem was primarily centered in the NFL, several athletes followed Kaepernick's path – Megan Rapinoe in the National Women’s Soccer League and Bruce Maxwell in Major League Baseball. Scores of NFL players would also kneel during the anthem in 2017.But as games were played and championships were won, the fever pitch around kneeling during the national anthem began to taper off – until the summer of 2020.In the wake of the death of George Floyd – who died in a police-involved incident in late May – players from all professional sports leagues planned protests during the national anthem.While most players have knelt during the national anthem, there was a handful of them who did not. Those players cited religion or equated kneeling with disrespecting the American flag or the military among other reasons.Players and coaches who didn’t kneel for the anthem explained their reasoning for the most part.**: Even NBA referees were a part of the protests during the national anthem to begin the league’s restarted season. But while they knelt in protest during the first few games, Barnaky refused to kneel for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” He explained his reasoning in a statement to ESPN.“I fully support the social justice movement and everyone who chooses to kneel as a means of peaceful protest. For me personally, it is important I stand for our national anthem, which is what I chose to do this evening. I believe you can be committed to both ideas and I will continue to support the league’s social justice efforts to help bring equality to this country.”**: The San Antonio Spurs coach and assistant Becky Hammon stood for the anthem despite Popovich’s longstanding support of social justice initiatives.“I'd prefer to keep that to myself,” Popovich said when asked about his reasoning, according to USA Today.“Everybody has to make a personal decision. The league's been great about that; everybody has the freedom to react any way they want. For whatever reasons that I have, I reacted the way I wanted to.”Popovich is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force.<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14249_News_0>**: Jonathan Isaac was the first player to stand for the national anthem in the NBA, which prides itself on being on the frontlines of social justice. Austin stood for the anthem without a Black Lives Matter shirt before his Orlando Magic took on the Brooklyn Nets.Isaac explained why he didn’t kneel or wear a shirt supporting the movement, according to Bleacher Report.“I believe that Black Lives Matter. A lot went into my decision, and part of it is, I thought that kneeling or wearing the Black Lives Matter t-shirt doesn't go hand-in-hand with supporting Black lives. So I felt like, just me personally, what is that I believe is taking on a stance that, I do believe that Black lives matter, but I just felt like it was a decision that I had to make, and I didn't feel like putting that shirt on and kneeling went hand in hand with supporting Black lives. I believe that for myself, my life has been supported by gospel, Jesus Christ, and everyone is made in the image of God and that we all forge through God's glory.“Each and every one of us do things that we shouldn't do and say things that we shouldn't say. We hate and dislike things that we shouldn't hate and dislike, and sometimes it gets to a point where we point fingers, whose evil is worse, and sometimes it comes down to whose evil is most visible. So I felt like I wanted to take a stand on, we all make mistakes, but I think that the gospel of Jesus Christ is that there's grace for us, and that Jesus came and died for our sins and that if we all come to an understanding of that and that God wants to have a relationship with us, that we can get kept all of the things in our world that our messed up, jacked up.“I think when you look around, racism isn't the only thing that plagues our society, that plagues our nation, that plagues our world, and I think coming together on that message that we want to get past not only racism but everything that plagues as us as a society, I feel like the answer to that is gospel.”<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14249_News_1>**: Meyers Leonard, of the Miami Heat, chose to stand for the national anthem as well during the league’s first games of the restarted season. Leonard said he believes “Black lives matter” but went further in his explanation to reporters after the game.“Some of the conversations I’ve had over the past three days, quite literally, have been the most difficult,” he said. “I am with the Black Lives Matter movement and I love and support the military and my brother and the people who have fought to defend our rights in this country.Leonard decried the racial division currently gripping the country and said he finds it troubling that certain people now choose to deal in moral absolutes.“I am a compassionate human being and I truly love all people,” he explained. “I can’t fully comprehend how our world, literally and figuratively, has turned into Black and white. There’s a line in the sand, so to speak: ‘If you’re not kneeling, you’re not with us.’ And that’s not true.\"He added: “I live my life to serve and impact others in a positive way.”**: Rachel Hill, of the Chicago Red Stars, stood by her teammates Casey Short and Julie Ertz while they embraced while kneeling during the anthem. Hill said she stood for the anthem because of her family’s military history.“I chose to stand because of what the flag inherently means to my military family members and me, but I 100% percent support my peers. Symbolically, I tried to show this with the placement of my hand on Casey’s shoulder and bowing my head. I struggled, but felt that these actions showed my truth, and in the end I wanted to remain true to myself,” Hill said in a statement posted on Twitter.“If this wasn’t clear, let my words and further actions be. I support the black lives matter movement wholeheartedly. I also support and will do my part in fighting against the current inequality. As a white athlete, it is way past due for me to be diligently anti-racist.”<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14249_News_2>**: Samantha Murphy, of the North Carolina Courage, also stood for the anthem on the sideline before one of her first matches. Murphy was wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt but didn’t explain her reasoning for standing for the anthem. Murphy, also known as Samantha Leshnak, reportedly did take a knee in solidarity with other players while the public address announcer at Zions Bank Stadium read a statement to honor victims of racial injustice.**: Players from the New York Yankees and Washington Nationals knelt for their first game and most of the players from the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers – except for Giants pitcher Sam Coonrod. He was the only player to stand ahead of their game.“I’m a Christian,\" he said, according to TMZ Sports. “So I just believe that I can’t kneel before anything besides God.”Aside from his religious beliefs, the 27-year-old relief pitcher said there are aspects of the movement that he disagrees with.“I just can’t get on board with a couple things I’ve read about Black Lives Matter, how they lean towards Marxism,” he continued. “And … they said some negative things about the nuclear family. I just can’t get on board with that.”<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14249_News_3>**: While NFL players are expected to kneel during the national anthem at the start of the 2020 season, the Pittsburgh Steelers defensive end has said he plans to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” He said multiple times in July that he had no plans to kneel for the anthem.“Also I’m not kneeling for the flag and screw anybody who have a problem with that,” Tuitt wrote on Twitter on July 27. “My grandmother was a immigrant from the Carribean and ... worked her ass off to bring 20 people over the right way. She had no money and educated herself to be a nurse. She living good now.”He added on July 31: “I stand for the flag because I am a proud American. Like previously stated, this country has provided and rewarded my family in so many ways through our perseverance and hard work. I will continue to honor my country and be an example to my children to stand for what they believe in. In regards to police brutality and the black lives matter movement I will support these causes through other means. It’s unfortunate that a couple unprofessional individuals have caused such havoc on our country and damaged the trust of its citizens. I will not let those individuals steer me from the fact on the opportunity this country gives for everyone.

{"title": "MLB's 2020 pandemic-shortened season: Everything you need to know", "body": "The 2020 MLB season will be totally different – one that has never been seen before.The coronavirus pandemic forced the league to reconsider starting on time and think about how games were going to be played as the U.S. and the rest of the world combat the disease.After tense negotiations between the owners and the players union, Commissioner Rob Manfred stepped in to implement a 60-game season set to begin on July 23 or 24.Each team is set to play against each of its four divisional rivals 10 times, and four games against the other five clubs in the corresponding division in the other league. A team will make only one trip to each city it visits, according to the plan.Other details included: games involving National League teams will include designated hitters; at the start of extra innings, there will be a runner on second base, and the number of playoff teams will remain at 10. Additionally, the trade deadline will be Aug. 31 while the deadline for postseason eligibility is Sept. 15. Also, active rosters will be 30 during the first two weeks of the season, 28 during the second two weeks and 26 following that. Teams will not expand to 28 roster spots on Sept. 1, as originally intended this year.Because no minor league games are being played this year, teams will be able to hold onto 60 players, including a taxi squad. Up to three players from the taxi squad can travel with a team to a game, and one of the three must be a catcher.MLB is also keeping the innovation of the three-batter minimum for pitchers, but decided to keep the injured list minimum for pitchers at 10 days rather than 15, as initially intended.Read below to review each team’s season preview.**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_0>: 2nd NL West: 85-77: Torey Lovullo**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_1>: 1st NL East: 97-65: Brian Snitker**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_2>: 5th AL East: 54-108: Brandon Hyde**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_3>: 3rd AL East: 84-78: Ron Roenicke**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_4>: 3rd NL Central: 84-78: David Ross**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_5>: 3rd AL Central: 72-89: Rick Renteria**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_6>: 4th NL Central: 75-87: David Bell**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_7>: 2nd AL Central: 93-69: Terry Francona**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_8>: 4th NL West: 71-91: Bud Black**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_9>: 5th AL Central: 47-114: Ron Gardenhire**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_10>: 1st AL West: 107-55: Dusty Baker**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_11>: 4th AL Central: 59-103: Mike Matheny**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_12>: 4th AL West: 72-90: Joe Maddon**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_13>: 1st NL West: 106-56: Dave Roberts**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_14>: 5th NL Central: 57-105: Don Mattingly**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_15>: 2nd NL Central: 89-73: Craig Counsell**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_16>: 1st AL Central: 101-61: Rocco Baldelli**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_17>: 3rd AL East: 86-76: Luis Rojas**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_18>: 1st AL East: 103-59: Aaron Boone**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_19>: 2nd AL West: 97-65: Bob Melvin**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_20>: 4th NL East: 81-81: Joe Girardi**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_21>: 5th NL Centra: 69-93: Derek Shelton**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_22>: 5th NL West: 70-92: Jayce Tingler**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_23>: 3rd NL West: 77-85: Gabe Kapler**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_24>: 5th AL Central: 68-94: Scott Servais**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_25>: 1st NL Central: 91-71: Mike Shildt**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_26>: 2nd AL East: 96-66: Kevin Cash**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_27>: 3rd AL Central: 78-84: Chris Woodward**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_28>: 4th AL East: 67-95: Charlie Montoyo**<IMG Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News_29>: 2nd NL East: 93-69: Davey Martinez", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/mlbs-2020-pandemic-shortened-season-everything-you-need-to-know", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_MLB_14358_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "FILE - In this Feb. 27, 2020, file photo, Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Madison Bumgarner throws during the second inning of spring training baseball game against the Cincinnati Reds in Scottsdale Ariz.

{"title": "Who won the 1999 NBA championship? Here is why the 1999 season was shortened to 50 games", "body": "During the 1998-99 National Basketball Association season, history was made. For the first time in the NBA, the regular season was shortened due to unforeseen disputes. The 1999 NBA Finals concluded the shortened season playoffs between the Western Conference champion, the San Antonio Spurs, and the Eastern Conference champion, the New York Knicks. The series was formatted in a 2-3-2 that resulted in the first two and last two games being hosted by the team with a home-court advantage. Eventually, the association reformed the Finals to a 2-2-1-1-1 game format. The Spurs held the home-court advantage as head coach Gregg Popovich led them, while coach Jeff Van Gundy managed the Knicks. The 1999 championship of more than two decades ago was the Knicks' latest NBA Finals appearance. Game 1 of the series took place on June 16, 1999, and was won by the Spurs, 89-77, after forward Tim Duncan, scored 33 points. Two days later, the teams faced off again, with all-star player Duncan again leading his team to a dominating victory over the Knicks in Game 2, 80-67. Previously, neither of the teams had faced off against the other in the regular season, making the Finals the first televised game of 1999 between them. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15079_News_0>In Game 3, the Knicks were triumphant over the Spurs, 89-81. Their first victory of the Finals was played to a sold-out crowd in Madison Square Garden. Shooting guard Allan Houston was the high scorer, with 34 points. Game 4 was close, but the Spurs ended up taking home the victory over the Knicks, 96-89. During Game 5, the Knicks led 77-76 against the Spurs with one minute left in the game. However, with just seconds left on the clock, Avery Johnson scored the game-winning shot, defeating the Knicks 78-77. The 1999 Finals was the first NBA Championship in the history of the Spurs franchise. The 1998-99 NBA season was the shortest season in league history due to a labor dispute between the NBA and the players union over salaries. Normally, a season has 82 games, but in 1999 it was cut down to 50 as the lockout lasted from July 1, 1998 until Jan. 20, 1999. Disputes between NBA owners, executives and representatives for the athletes almost led to the entire season being canceled. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15079_News_1><IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15079_News_2><IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15079_News_3>However, the work stoppage ended after executives with the NBA and representatives of the National Basketball Players Association agreed to a new settlement that boosted maximum salaries for players and allowed rookie athletes to earn more in their first year. After the Spurs took home the victory in Game 5 of the series, their star forward, Tim Duncan, won Most Valuable Player of the NBA Finals.

{"title": "Buckhead secession: Leader in ritzy Atlanta suburb says residents not getting what they 'need and deserve'", "body": "An elected official representing Atlanta’s Buckhead neighborhood said those living in the suburb, which is at the center of an ongoing secession effort, are not getting what they \"need and deserve\" and have been neglected by city government.Leaders pushing for Buckhead to become its own entity have grown less outspoken in recent months than in 2021, when the effort made headlines amid news of bloodshed in the ritzy, tree-lined suburb. But \"time is of the essence\" for Buckhead, whether as an Atlanta neighborhood or its own city, Atlanta City Council Member Mary Norwood said. Norwood, who represents District 7, the western portion of Buckhead, described in an op-ed on InsiderAdvantage.com how she is \"often asked: What is causing Buckhead residents to entertain the idea of forming their own city government, separate from Atlanta?\"Many assume the reason is crime because that is what they have heard. But there is a great deal more to it than that,\" wrote Norwood, who once led an unsuccessful bid for mayor. \"It boils down to many years of Buckhead’s neglect by the City of Atlanta’s government.\"Norwood said her district is grappling with \"suffocating\" traffic, streets that \"are in the second-worst condition of all Council Districts, flooding and an influx of new residents because the neighborhood has \"accepted a disproportionate share of ‘growing Atlanta!’\" she wrote. District 8 needs newly paved streets, its \"neighborhoods preserved\" and its \"citizens safe,\" among other things, she wrote. But it has \"been overlooked and underserved for years.\"\"Buckhead is not getting what we need and deserve. If the Atlanta government wants to forestall the creation of a separate city, it should focus on the same thing that I, as a City Council member, am focused on: the delivery of services to my constituents,\" she wrote in conclusion. \"The concerns I have been hearing throughout my district, and that I am expressing here, should be taken very seriously by our Atlanta City Government. Time is of the essence.\"Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Lisa Gordon reportedly sent Norwood a five-page response in which she wrote that she and Norwood had met just one week prior to discuss Norwood's concerns. Norwood's piece, Gordon said, \"lacked context or accuracy, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_0>\"Since Mayor Dickens took office in January, he has continually delivered on each of these priorities, not just for Buckhead but for all of Atlanta,\" she wrote. She later added: \"The Mayor remains committed to serving the needs of all of Atlanta’s residents, visitors and businesses. He will continue to be the city’s loudest and most forceful champion in ensuring we remain one city, in opposition to efforts to de-annex any part of Atlanta.\"She went on: \"Breaking up our city would be a travesty for everyone. It is far better for us to work together during challenging times. That is what made Atlanta—and the special community of Buckhead—great.\"Atlanta Police Department statistics show total crime in Buckhead, Zone 2, is down 10%, FOX 5 Atlanta reported. Norwood’s counterpart, Council Member Howard Shook, who represents District 7, the remainder of Buckhead, argued that Atlanta’s newly minted Mayor Andre Dickens has \"been very attentive to listening to Buckhead.\" Shook noted that Georgia’s House and Senate leaders have \"sidetracked\" the Buckhead secession effort, but he also acknowledged that \"it’s not going to go away.\" \"My position is the same. If my constituents are going to go to the polls and make the most consequential vote in the history of this city, they need to have all the facts,\" he said. \"Here are the pluses, here are the minuses. And I would tell you that, right now, we don’t have that.\"Shook explained: \"What's it going to cost? What? What are the true costs? What problems would not be solved?Shook spoke to Fox News Digital in June 2021, when he said his constituents \"don't compare Zone 2 crime stats to Zone 5 crime stats. They are human beings. They compare how they feel now about crime and how they think they remember feeling about crime 10 years ago.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_1>When asked Thursday if he thought his constituents felt safe today, he responded, \"No.\"\"The crime stats may be down. But, the problem is, if you go to a public meeting and ask whether you or your neighbors had a car broken into or whether you and your neighbor have felt threatened, all the hands go up,\" Shook said. \"The stats may have changed, but the psyche hasn’t changed.\"And not everyone has supported the \"divorce.\" Bill Linville, a spokesperson for The Committee for a United Atlanta, said the group commissioned a poll of Buckhead voters, 61% of whom said they would not vote in favor of Buckhead's secession. He told Fox News Digital he believed \"breaking up our capital city would be a disaster for everyone involved.\"\"The Buckhead community and the city of Atlanta are inextricably linked. Whether it is through public education, through police and fire protection, through pensions and bond commitments that are billions of dollars and a myriad of governing and legal issues.\"Publicity surrounding the Buckhead secession efforts gained momentum around the summer of 2021, after a 41-year-old father of three was shot while walking in his neighborhood. The man was shot twice around 8:35 a.m. on June 4, 2021, when a silver Hyundai sedan rolled up to him, police and his wife said at the time. The gunman, identified by authorities as 22-year-old Gaelen Newsom, allegedly first shot Worrell in the leg, then fired another round before fleeing. Newsom later crashed into and seriously injured a man in his 20s who was taking out the trash, police said at the time. He was later taken into custody. A man was shot the next day at the Intercontinental Hotel in Buckhead during a domestic dispute, police said.And Buckhead has recently seen high-profile crimes, including those involving celebrities. In mid-June, NBA legend Vince Carter’s Buckhead mansion was burglarized by thieves while his wife and two sons were inside. The trio hid in a closet and called 911 while the burglars ransacked the home and stole nearly $100,000 in cash, police said. Investigators reportedly recovered two guns and over $16,000 outside Carter’s home.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_2>And, last weekend, a music executive who has long represented famous rapper Ludacris, surrendered to police on charges related to a fatal shooting at a Buckhead restaurant in June. Chaka Zulu, whose real name is Ahmed Obafemi, was charged — along with several others — in connection with a June 26, 2022, shooting at a restaurant on Peachtree Road. Three men, including Zulu, were wounded. One of the wounded men later died, police said. But Zulu’s attorney, Banks Weaver LLC’s Gabe Banks, said his client was \"attacked and jumped from behind by a gang\" of at least four people. He said his client was licensed to carry a gun, which he fired out of self-defense.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_3>Zulu \"was forced to defend himself after this gang repeatedly stomped, punched and kicked him while he was on the ground in a defenseless posture,\" Banks wrote in an emailed statement earlier this week. \"Mr. Zulu was shot in the back during the shooting and nearly lost his life and is still recovering from the nearly fatal injuries he sustained that evening,\" Banks added. \"Mr. Zulu was at his place of business that night and had every right to defend himself.\"It is not lost on Mr. Zulu that someone lost his life, but had Mr. Zulu not lawfully defended himself, Mr. Zulu would have been killed that night.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//us/buckhead-secession-leader-ritzy-atlanta-suburb-says-residents-not-getting-what-they-need-deserve", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Atlanta's skyline in an undated photo.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/468d894e-atlantaskyline.jpg"}, {"caption": "Atlanta Police officers responded around 11:35 p.m. Sunday to the Buckhead Target on Peachtree Road", "id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/waga-atlanta-seucirty-guard-shooting-2.png"}, {"caption": "Ludacris and Chaka Zulu attend Michigan Avenue Magazine Celebrates Its Summer Issue with Ludacris at LondonHouse July 13, 2017, in Chicago.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-814203252.jpg"}, {"caption": "Chaka Zulu attends the Culture Creators Innovators and Leaders Awards at The Beverly Hilton June 26, 2021, in Beverly Hills, Calif.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15137_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1325767920.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Novak Djokovic, Kyrie Irving, Aaron Rodgers are modern day heirs of Muhammad Ali: Clay Travis", "body": "Social media, as we currently have experienced it in the COVID-19 era, mostly exists to police thought and insist on uniformity of opinion on all COVID issues. That’s been the overarching principle that has governed since March of 2020 in this country. The \"experts\" in science and medicine at the CDC and the NIH made a determination about what the COVID science was and then attempted to destroy anyone who challenged that consensus opinion by deploying their assets in the mainstream media.The government, in conjunction with major tech companies and the media, has colluded to censor anyone who has challenged the consensus opinion when it comes to masks, the safety of opening schools, whether lockdowns made sense, whether sports could be played, the efficacy of the COVID shot, and where COVID came from. We were told what an acceptable narrative was and then anyone who challenged that narrative was relentlessly attacked by powerful media interests and hammered by social media mobs.It didn’t matter that the government, big tech, and the mainstream media were wrong about all of this, they wouldn’t allow any debate on the issues. Suddenly \"science\" was the opposite of science, if you questioned anything you belonged in the gulag. If you asked why young and healthy people should get the COVID shot, you were shouted down. If you asked why the government should be determining what an essential and inessential business was, woe unto you. Never in my life have I seen an unholy trinity of censorship like I’ve seen with the power of government, big tech, and the mainstream media all pulling in the same direction when it came to enforcing their own narrative of COVID.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News_0>Even if, as you have all noticed by now, the entire narrative of COVID was mostly wrong. Schools should have never shut down because kids could have gone to school safely all along. Masks did virtually nothing, if anything at all, to stop the spread of COVID. You didn’t actually need to Lysol your mail and groceries, you could go to the beach and hike on trails, your kid’s local playground didn’t need to be covered with crime scene tape and we didn’t need to be ripping rims off outdoor basketball hoops and arresting lone paddle boarders in the Pacific Ocean. The six foot of social distancing was bunk, all of this was madness.Pure unadulterated madness.It was mass delusion on a level none of us living today in America have ever seen before.Everyone didn’t agree with these decisions, of course, many knew better, but most either still pretended they agreed by yelling along with the mob lest they become targets of the covid mob themselves or they stayed meekly silent. But not everyone was silent, a daring few were willing to speak up in the face of these powerful entities and challenge the prevailing consensus.And some of these people came from sports.For generations we’ve been talking about who the next Muhammad Ali of sports would be. Ali, you’ll recall, famously refused to fight in Vietnam, giving up his heavyweight title and going to prison over his refusal. Today Ali’s bravery in standing up to the government and its media allies is widely acclaimed, but in the 1960s that wasn’t so. Ali was a revolutionary, an outspoken advocate for peace in a time of war, a man who was willing to give up his fame and fortune to stand on the principles for which he believed.Now it’s virtually impossible to find anyone who speaks out in favor of the Vietnam War being fought, but in the 1960s Ali’s stand was remarkably controversial. Today history has vindicated Ali and almost everyone proclaims him a hero, but that wasn’t the case when Ali spoke out against the Vietnam War. He was radioactive, anti-American, how dare he defy the government and stand against its excesses? Why didn’t he just shut up and go to war?There’s obsessive talk in America today about being on the right and wrong side of history. I’ve been thinking about this a great deal as the COVID era continues and we prepare for another election in 2022 and 2024. All day long we are lectured on social media about the right and wrong side of history, frequently by people who have no actual knowledge of history.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News_1>And the more I think about it, the more I’ve come to see our present COVID era as the historical equivalent, in many ways, of the Vietnam Era. I’m not saying the eras are complete replicas — after all history doesn’t repeat it rhymes — but there are many congruencies.I believe that our country’s response to COVID is the biggest failure of American public policy since the Vietnam War. And both failures have much in common. Remember, after all, it was the best and brightest in our country, the experts of their day, who all told us that fighting in Vietnam was a necessity. But all those experts, with all their fancy degrees and brilliant training, got it wrong. And the Muhammad Alis, the non-experts and the regular people speaking out against the war, got it right.We had no business being in Vietnam. The experts were wrong. Ali, indisputably, was on the right side of history when it came to the Vietnam War and the government’s mandates that many young men give up their lives to travel halfway around the world to fight in a jungle for a country they could barely find on a map.I was thinking about this over the weekend as I listened to Joe Rogan’s podcast with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. And as I listened to Rogan and Rodgers, a couple of sports dudes with no advanced scientific degrees, make more sense talking about COVID than Dr. Fauci has in over two years, I couldn’t help but think how much I admired Rodgers for speaking out about COVID and our government’s failures of policy.The easiest thing in the world for Rodgers to do was to meekly submit and get the COVID shot. If he’d gone public with how excited he was to get the COVID shot, he would have been universally praised by the media, the big tech algorithms would have made him a hero, Joe Biden might have even given him the presidential medal of honor. But Rodgers didn’t stay silent and he didn’t pretend it made sense to get the COVID shot.In a time filled with sheep, he was a lion.He spoke out. And as a result Rodgers has been publicly attacked more aggressively than almost any athlete in our lives for refusing to submit and get the COVID shot. President Joe Biden even attacked him by name and Joe Biden can barely remember anyone’s name. These attacks came despite the fact that Rodgers has been completely right about the COVID shot. He, and no other young and healthy athlete, actually needed the shot. The fact that any sports league tried to bully their athletes into getting it is a failure of generational proportions. Particularly because the shot, despite what Dr. Fauci told us, neither keeps you from getting COVID nor stops you from spreading it.You can watch a small piece of the Rogan and Rodgers discussion here.Their discussion also made me angry because the U.S. Open tennis tournament is also starting this week and one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Novak Djokovic, isn’t being permitted to play in the tournament because he’s refused to get the COVID shot. Djokovic, who has 21 majors, may well have lost the chance to be the greatest tennis player of all time because he also wasn’t allowed to play in the Australian Open and the U.S. Open. Djokovic would have been favored to win both the Aussie and U.S. Open if only he’d been willing to get a COVID shot. That would have potentially gotten him to 23, which would have been a new all time record for majors.But Djokovic refused too.And as a result he’s been uniformly attacked by multiple governments, by big tech, and by the media that cover his sport. Just like Rodgers, the easiest thing in the world for Djokovic to do would have been to get the shot and submit to the mandates of government authorities.Which brings me to Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News_2>Kyrie also refused to get the COVID shot and was uniformly ridiculed by media and tech algorithms across the country. Politicians ripped Irving, his own league ripped him, the pressure to simply get the shot was overwhelming. Heck, it even cost Kyrie tens of millions of dollars not to play.But still Kyrie refused.He even pointed out the absurdity of New York City’s COVID rules by showing up and sitting courtside to watch a game he wasn’t permitted to play in, but could sit and watch. Kyrie left tens of millions of dollars on the table because he wasn’t willing to submit to the government or his employer.And as I thought about all three of these men, and their willingness to stand up to the full power of the attempted COVID mandates in the United States government, I couldn’t help but think about Ali and the Vietnam draft mandates. These three athletes are doing what Ali did, they are speaking truth to power, standing on principle over money and praise, directly defying the United States government because they believe that in a democracy some things are more important than universal acclaim. They’re doing exactly what the woke sports media claims we want all athletes to do, using their platforms to speak inconvenient truth to power.And they’re being crushed for it.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News_3>This will probably be the only sports column you’ve ever read praising all three men for their COVID shot decisions. Compare that with the hundreds that have been written crushing them for their choices. Yet much like Ali, I firmly believe that in the decades to come all of these men are going to be vindicated by history. Rodgers, Djokovic and Irving are, contrary to what the blue checks in masks on social media lecturing you have been saying for years, on the right side of history. And all their critics are on the wrong side of history.We overuse the term bravery in American life in general, but especially in sports. Name your favorite athlete and type in brave beside their name and there’s likely to be some online hagiography written talking about how brave it was to play in a game after an injury or speak out about left wing social media causes. Megan Rapinoe, the left wing sports media will argue, was so brave not to attend the White House to celebrate the U.S. women’s World Cup win. It was so brave of LeBron James to pose with a safety pin on the cover of Sports Illustrated after Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016, look at Colin Kaepernick, it was so brave to kneel. They’re all modern day Muhammad Alis!But what these articles miss is this historical truth — true bravery requires risk and, often, leads to attack. It isn’t brave to do what the masses want, to give the mob what they demand. Rapinoe, James and Kaepernick all were rewarded financially for their left wing political stances. They all made more money than they would have made if they’d just stayed silent. If you take a stand and the government, big tech companies and the media all praise you, you haven’t actually stood up for anything important, you’ve just made a smart financial decision, further buttressed your bank account, added a new mansion to your portfolio.True bravery, as I define it, requires the risk of life or freedom. The only athlete who has truly risked his life in the 21st century is Pat Tillman, who gave up millions to play pro football and died halfway around the world serving his country in Afghanistan. Tillman’s sacrifice is, if anything, wildly underdiscussed in our modern society, he’s in a complete class by himself when it comes to athletes and bravery.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News_4>But if we want to expand the idea of bravery to require the risk of life, freedom, or your career, then Novak Djokovic, Aaron Rodgers and Kyrie Irving are the three bravest athletes of the social media era. All three men made unpopular choices that could have left them unable to continue their careers.And they did it despite substantial acrimony raining down upon them from government figures, big tech companies and the media that cover them.It may take a decade or more for the masses to come to support the bravery that Djokovic, Rodgers and Irving showed when it came to defying governmental COVID shot mandates, but just like with Ali and his defiance of the government’s Vietnam War draft, I believe history will come to praise all three men for being on the right side of history.While history doesn’t repeat, it rhymes, something that the noted wordsmith Ali certainly would appreciate. And by standing up to government overreach even at great personal cost, Irving, Djokovic and Rodgers all are the modern day heirs of Ali.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/novak-djokovic-kyrie-irving-aaron-rodgers-modern-day-heirs-muhammad-ali-clay-travis", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic returns the ball during an exhibition match in Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on July 13, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241890341.jpg"}, {"caption": "Quarterback Aaron Rodgers #12 of the Green Bay Packers gestures as he exits the field after losing the NFC Divisional Playoff game to the San Francisco 49ers at Lambeau Field on January 22, 2022, in Green Bay, Wisconsin.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15192_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1366357218.jpg"}, {"caption": "Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving (11) drives in front of Orlando Magic guard R.J.

{"title": "Will Hardy is ready to lead Jazz as NBA's youngest head coach", "body": "Will Hardy knew some of the inner workings of the Utah Jazz before being named the league's youngest current head coach.Sure, it was in 2009, and he was just an intern.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15306_News_0>Ahead of his final year at Williams College, he put in eight weeks in the business operations department, spending his mornings with the Jazz, afternoons helping the Salt Lake Bees — a Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels — and evenings at the gym rehabbing from hip surgery.One of Hardy’s initial assignments was to give tours of Vivint Arena, a building he had never entered before his internship. That didn’t hold him back — and his ability to adapt on the fly could now serve the Jazz well.\"Those (tours) were adventurous for sure,\" Hardy said. \"I was kind of learning the building as I went.\"Utah introduced Hardy as its coach Tuesday. The 34-year-old, who was an assistant coach with the Boston Celtics, will steer the ship as the team sails into a rebuilding process with All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell as the cornerstone.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15306_News_1>The change began when Quin Snyder stepped down in June after eight seasons, followed by trades that sent away three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert and Royce O’Neale and brought in Malik Beasley, Jarred Vanderbilt and Patrick Beverly. The team also collected an assortment of first-round NBA draft picks to use as building blocks.Hardy is ready to embrace whatever direction Jazz CEO Danny Ainge and GM Justin Zanik decide to take.\"I trust Danny and Justin,\" Hardy said. \"Their track record and their history speaks for itself. But they’ve been really open and communicative with me and collaborative throughout the process.\"Hardy’s coaching philosophy won Ainge and Zanik over during the interview process. Ainge said they put him through exercises to learn his approach to everything from scouting reports to player development plans.\"Yeah, he’s 34 years old, but he didn’t feel 34 to us and we didn’t really pay much attention to that,\" said Ainge, whom Hardy impressed with his basketball acumen. \"He just seemed very mature, very prepared … many times in his answers, he spoke my language.\"Hardy beat out veteran NBA coaches Frank Vogel and Terry Stotts for the job during an extensive process that included final interviews with team owner Ryan Smith and minority owner Dwyane Wade.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15306_News_2>\"It seemed like after the few stages we went through that Will was our guy and we couldn’t be more excited,\" Ainge said.Another thing that caught Ainge's eye: Hardy’s commitment to frequent practices, because, to him, repetition is a core element. But it doesn't have to be the traditional 90 minutes, Hardy said.\"We need to reframe that a little bit. Practice can be 30 minutes. The middle of the season can be hard. The schedule is grueling. ... But I think in order to build habits and to know what doing it right feels like, you need to do it full speed,\" Hardy said.Hardy has some, if limited, coaching experience with a few players currently on the Jazz roster. He was an assistant on Gregg Popovich’s staff when Rudy Gay played with the Spurs from 2017 to 2021 and helped with Team USA — for which Mitchell played — during the 2019 Basketball World Cup.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15306_News_3>Hardy knows he needs to get the team back on track after chemistry issues caused Utah to unravel late last season.\"Toughness, sacrifice, and passion are the three things that are most important to me,\" Hardy said. \"I want our group to be deeply competitive and able to deal with adversity. I would like everybody to recognize that this is bigger than them individually.

{"title": "Former NBA star calls out persecution at religious freedom summit", "body": "Former NBA star, Enes Kanter Freedom, was one of the many attendees at this week's International Religious Freedom Summit in Washington D.C. He told Fox News Digital he was attending to learn how to better help fight religious persecution. Politicians from both sides of aisle, religious leaders and freedom advocates gathered to discuss some of the most egregious acts of religious persecution happening in the world today.Kanter Freedom, a professional basketball player and devout Muslim, was born in Switzerland to Turkish parents. He has used his influence to highlight the injustices of dictators in defense of fundamental human rights.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News_0>The former Boston Celtics player legally changed his last name to ‘Freedom’ upon becoming a U.S. citizen last year, and has caught the attention of many with his creative sneakers highlighting religious and political persecution around the globe. His sneakers have included logos for ‘Free Tibet,’ ‘Free Uyghur,’ and in a reference to this year's Winter Olympic Games: ‘No Beijing 2022.’Just last week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began implementing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act’s provisions which prohibits the import of forced labor-produced products made in China's Xinjiang province into the United States.In a statement last month, the State Department said it is a priority to address forced labor and other human rights abuses in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and around the world. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News_1>\"We have taken concrete measures to promote accountability in Xinjiang, including visa restrictions, financial sanctions under Global Magnitsky, export controls, Withhold Release Orders and import restrictions, as well as the release of a multi-agency business advisory on Xinjiang to help U.S. companies avoid commerce that facilitates or benefits from human rights abuses, including forced labor,\" said the statement.Kanter Freedom told Fox News Digital, that he was attending the summit to, \"get educated.\" \"The most important thing that I want to see, they just come here because I know a few people, know stories of their struggles, and obviously the platform that is (given to) me is by God (and) it has an enormous reach all around the world. So I'm like trying to do whatever I can to just get people's stories, so I can share with the whole world,\" he said.One such survivor of religious persecution is Bob Fu, a house church leader in China where he and his wife were imprisoned for two months, accused of engaging in illegal religious activities as church pastors in Beijing. They both fled to the United States as religious refugees in 1997.Fu is now a leading voice for persecuted faith communities in China and started ChinaAid, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring international attention to China’s gross human rights violations and to promote religious freedom and the rule of law in China.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News_2>Fu added he is driven by his faith in God and sharing his organization was motivated \"by part of the scripture where Jesus said, if I'm hungry, give me, you know, a piece of bread, if thirsty a cup of water\" adding his cries were answered when accepted by the United States.He concluded by noting that he is on a faith mission to \"expose the abuses of the persecution, by equipping the leaders.\"A ‘Freedom Shoes’ exhibit is on display at the IRF Summit with basketball kicks designed by artists who are victims of religious persecution from around the world.Kanter Freedom said when he was a kid, he was always fascinated with the styles of sneakers worn by players; checking out the brand, color, comfort, and design.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News_3><IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News_4><IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News_5><IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News_6>\"I wanted to create the shoes I wanted to work with. [There are] artists [from] around the world who [have] been oppressed by their government because they know [what] the situation[s] there are. They put all their feelings and emotions in the shoes. And I was going out there putting the shoes on my feet and going out. They don't play basketball. And it became a huge trend,\" he said.Fans took note of his shoe game and became curious with which shoes and topic he would highlight next. He said he plans on producing sneakers to give the profits to communities in order to further his impact.The basketball star told Fox News Digital that he hopes to educate younger generations, so they can have a brighter future. He encourages other athletes to use their platforms through social media to stand up for what is right.\"I think it is important to talk about the right things and not be scared of (and) not worry about your endorsement deals or maybe your next paycheck or your contract.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//politics/former-nba-star-calls-out-persecution-religious-freedom-summit", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_15317_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "American professional basketball player, Enes Kanter Freedom, meeting with advocates at the IRF Summit breakfast.

{"title": "NBA Draft 2022: Ex-scout says Pistons could have 'the best backcourt' in 3-5 years, Cavs found right piece", "body": "The 2022 NBA Draft came and went Thursday as it was the appetizer to what will be an interesting offseason and a highly intriguing 2022-23 season tipping off later this year.Former NBA scout Michael Vandegarde, who told Fox News Digital last week he thought Jaden Ivey was the best prospect in the draft, said in a recent interview he was intrigued about where the former Purdue standout eventually landed.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15336_News_0>The Detroit Pistons selected Ivey with the No. 5 pick. It appeared he could have gone to the Sacramento Kings, but they decided to take former Iowa standout Keegan Murray with the fourth selection. Vandegarde said he thinks Ivey could fit better in Detroit and the backcourt with him and second-year player Cade Cunningham could turn into one of the best in the NBA.\"I think that in 3-5 years could be the best backcourt in the NBA. That’s exactly what Jaden Ivey needs – a cool, calm guy next to him that could control the game and then him do his thing. Just try to make Jaden Ivey your point guard is probably a little bit of a stretch right away but to have that next to him is absolutely ideal,\" Vandegarde told Fox News Digital.He said he understood why the Kings passed on Ivey, but wondered how a team that hasn’t had much success in the last 16 years passed up on a talent like Ivey.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15336_News_1>\"If It was the Kings, I probably wouldn’t have passed on him but I understand. They have De’Aaron Fox. They have Davion Mitchell, who they love. They were willing to trade (Tyrese) Haliburton to get Davion more minutes. I understand them drafting (Keegan) Murray,\" Vandegarde said. \"It makes sense but to pass up star talent is really, really, really troublesome when you’re at the top of the draft. You’re bad for a reason. You need the best player. I think Jaden Ivey is the best player. But I understand why they did it and I think Jaden Ivey probably ended up in a better situation with Detroit than the Kings.\"Vandegarde, who was a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers for 18 years, compared Ivey to Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant – even more athletic.Ivey was a consensus second-team All-American and a first-team All-Big Ten Conference in 2022 following his sophomore season with the Boilermakers. He played in 36 games and averaged 17.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists before deciding to go pro.As far as teams doing enough to make a leap to the postseason, Vandegarde wasn’t so sure this was the draft to do it. He said he liked what the Houston Rockets did, selecting former Auburn star Jabari Smith Jr. to pair with Jalen Green, but added they were still very young.\"But I think there should be a lot of hope for the future. With Jalen Green, Jabari Smith it’s an exciting young group,\" he said.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15336_News_2>Vandegarde mentioned the Cleveland Cavaliers’ selection of Ochai Agbaji with the No. 14 pick was just what the team needed to possibly make them contenders near the top half of the Eastern Conference.Agbaji led Kansas to a national championship last season. He was a Consensus All-American, 2022 Big 12 Player of the Year and the NCAA Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player. He averaged 18.8 points and 5.1 rebounds in 39 games for the Jayhawks.\"That’s exactly the type of player that they need and they’ve grown and they’ve gotten so much better in a year. That could be a piece that really elevates them into… instead of being eight, nine ten, they’re now four five, six,\" Vandegarde told Fox News Digital.The Cavaliers were in the four or five spots in the conference for most of the season until late injuries and a losing streak forced them into the play-in tournament where they would lose to the Brooklyn Nets and Atlanta Hawks. But with a young corps around them led by Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen and Isaac Okorko, the team could certainly make some noise. Not to mention, Collin Sexton returning from injury to start the year will be a major help.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15336_News_3>He mentioned other teams got guys who could help them in the long run, but nothing franchise-altering on the surface. He applauded the San Antonio Spurs, Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors for adding some key pieces with their selections.San Antonio selected Jeremy Sochan from Baylor, the Grizzlies selected Walker Kessler from Auburn and the Warriors picked up Patrick Baldwin Jr., out of UW-Milwaukee.While he’s not focused on scouting, Vandegarde teamed up with CoachTube. The digital platform provides online sports coaching and training from those who were experts in their respective fields.Vandegarde recently told Fox News Digital he’s gotten a lot of good feedback from those who use it.\"It’s been wonderful. I think the coaches really like it to get their name out there. Obviously, the world has changed in the last eight to 10 years. You used to have to sell videos at Walmart on the shelves, and now everything’s moved to a digital age and the feedback has been wonderful,\" he said.\"I think for somebody that lives in a certain part of the world or even a certain part of the United States, you don’t have access to the gym facilities and elite-level training.

{"title": "NBA Draft 2022: Ex-scout reveals who he thinks is the best prospect, compares him to Ja Morant", "body": "The 2022 NBA Draft is only a day away and the options for the top pick in this year’s event is still very much up in the air.Gonzaga’s Chet Holmgren, Auburn’s Jabari Smith and Duke’s Paolo Banchero are all among those who could feasibly be taken No. 1 overall when the Orlando Magic go on the clock Thursday.One former NBA scout believes Purdue standout Jaden Ivey is the best player in the draft.\"I think the guy I would select at No. 1 is Jaden Ivey,\" Michael Vandegarde, who worked as a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers for 18 years, told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15351_News_0>\"Jaden Ivey is everything (Memphis Grizzlies guard) Ja Morant is and was at the same age except he’s bigger, longer, and he might even be more athletic and Ja Morant’s a freak. I’m telling you Jaden Ivey… and he shot it much better this year. He dramatically improved every aspect of this game. He’s by far the closest thing I’ve seen to a Russell Westbrook or Ja Morant that I’ve ever seen. I absolutely love him.\"I would consider him at the No. 1 pick, and I’d be excited to take him, obviously in the top five, but if I’m staring at No. 1 I’d absolutely be 100% considering him. And if I had to choose today, I would say Jaden Ivey. If I’m staring at (Nos.) 2 or 3, he might get selected there. It wouldn’t shock me if (the Oklahoma City Thunder) take him at two. I just think no matter where you get (him) you get the chance at absolutely the best player on both ends of the floor, and he’s the most dynamic athlete in this draft bar none.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15351_News_1>Ivey was a consensus second-team All-American and a first-team All-Big Ten Conference in 2022 following his sophomore season with the Boilermakers. He played in 36 games and averaged 17.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists before deciding to go pro.Holmgren, Smith and Banchero also had solid careers for their respective schools.The 7-footer Holmgren was the 2022 West Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year averaged 14.1 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.7 blocks per game. He’s rated at the top of some mock drafts.Smith was named the Wayman Tisdale Award winner for being the most outstanding freshman men’s basketball player in 2022. He finished his lone year at Auburn with a 16.9 points and 7.4 rebounds per game average.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15351_News_2>Banchero was the 2022 ACC Rookie of the Year. He averaged 17.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game for DukeVandegarde added he thought Shaedon Sharpe could develop into a formidable NBA player. He was a five-star shooting guard when he graduated early to play for Kentucky. However, he did not play game for the Wildcats and decided to turn pro. \"There’s some really high-level guys,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I’d even go down to Shaedon Sharpe. I’ve seen him for the last three years. He’s a little bit of a wildcard. But I’ll tell you what, when I saw him two years ago and did some scouting on him, he was the closet thing I saw to Kobe Bryant that I’ve seen as a junior in high school. I absolutely love him. (But) there’s some major question marks. We haven’t seen play at the highest level, but I absolutely love that kid.\"As a potential underdog selection, Vandegarde mentioned Caleb Houstan as a potential solid pick later in the first round. He played in 34 games as a freshman at Michigan, averaging 10.1 points and 4 rebounds per game.\"Not an elite athlete,\" Vandegarde said of Houstan, \"but he was an elite shooter in high school for many years. He didn’t have an elite season maybe at Michigan but sometimes some of these guys that were amazing in high school turned out to be much better players.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15351_News_3>The draft is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the home of the Nets.

{"title": "NBA champ Jason Terry wraps first season as G League head coach, explains what he's learned from the greats", "body": "NBA champion Jason Terry just wrapped up his first season as a head coach in the G League with the Grand Rapids Gold – an affiliate of the Denver Nuggets.Terry played 19 seasons in the NBA with the Atlanta Hawks, Dallas Mavericks, Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks before calling it quits after the 2017-18 season. He won a championship when he was with the Mavericks in 2011 and was the 2008-09 Sixth Man of the Year award winner.He served as an assistant coach at his alma mater in Arizona before taking the Gold’s job at the start of the 2021-22 season. The Gold finished with a 17-15 record, just missing out on the playoffs.Terry, who recently became the head of athletic performance for FlexIt, opened up to Fox News Digital about his foray into the coaching world. He said some of the challenges about coaching in the G League are the players going back and forth between the team and the NBA.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15553_News_0>\"The biggest challenge we face is having to integrate new guys into your system, into your team, into your family on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. The roster changes and turns over and you have to have the ability to adapt and adjust and also keep the guys happy that are on your team knowing somebody else is coming in, taking their opportunity away from them for the moment. Being able to put guys into different roles, so to speak,\" he said. \"I think that was one of the biggest challenges I faced and I thought we did a particularly good job of it.\"The G League is a developmental league designed to give guys an opportunity to showcase their talent to get called up to the next level. We had a tremendous success with that this season, having almost eight guys get called up this year to the big leagues.\"For guys who bounce back and forth between the G League and getting the call-up to the NBA, Terry said it was important for him as a coach to really hone in on their abilities and narrow down what they want to accomplish.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15553_News_1>\"In the first conversation with guys of that magnitude is kind of like, why do you do this? Once we figure out what your ‘why’ is, who are you? Who are you as a person? Who are you as a player? What is it that you do, that unique skill set that you bring, that unique talent that you bring to the table that no one else does? OK, let’s tap into that and then let’s get you the best at that. And what’re your weaknesses? Whatever you weaknesses are, we’ll develop and we’ll work on those,\" Terry explained.\"Again, rely on your strengths, work on your weaknesses and really tap into who you are as a player. And then, what are your habits? Are you a worker? If you’re not, we need to change that because to get to where you want to be in life, not just in basketball, you have to be dedicated. You have to be committed to your craft. And I think a lot of guys struggle with that from time to time. They get distracted for whatever reason, but if they stay locked in and stay steadfast to their dream, they can achieve anything.\"Terry gave credit to some of the coaches he’s played for – like Rick Carlisle, Avery Johnson and Jason Kidd just to name a few – who helped him instill his mentality when it comes to leading a team from a coaching standpoint. He said his high school coach also had a major impact.\"My high school coach Ron Drayton instilled discipline in me as a high school player my sophomore year of high school. You knew he had zero tolerance. Every time we stepped onto the floor it was about business,\" Terry told Fox News Digital. \"He was a defensive-oriented, defensive-minded coach. He could care less what you did offensively. It was all about defense and holding you accountable.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15553_News_2>\"I think Johnson was similar. They called him the little general for a reason. Playing the point guard position, the same position he played, he demanded and expected a lot out of his point guards. And I was just blessed and fortunate to be a part of the team when he was given his opportunity and he poured into me, man. He really poured into me as a basketball player, as a man, as a husband, as a father. And without his guidance and mentorship, I couldn’t honestly say I’d be able to be a head coach in this league.\"Terry said he has taken what he’s learned as a player from some of the great head coaches he’s had and attempts to instill that in his coaching and game planning with the Gold.\"There’s so many life lessons that I’ve learned along the way from the various coaches, game-planning, how to manage people. A lot of what I do as a coach now is from what I’ve seen as a player and from the coaches that have guided me along the way,\" he said. \"My system is very similar to that of an Avery Johnson. How I manage the game is very similar to Jason Kidd. How I interact with my players is very similar to a Jason Kidd but how I strategically plan is that of a Rick Carlisle\"I take bits and pieces of every and each coach that I've come in contact with, not to mention the late great Lute Olson, who had me when I was just a pup at the University of Arizona. His ability to connect with his players and make it a brotherhood and hold you accountable is something that is a characteristic I also embody into my team.\"Nik Stauskas, Isaiah Thomas, Matt Ryan, Lance Stephenson and Davon Reed were among those who were called up from the Gold this season. Stauskas, Thomas and Reed each had two call-ups.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15553_News_3>Terry partnered with FlexIt earlier this season to offer virtual solutions for those looking to get fit but don’t have access to a personal trainer.

{"title": "Nets owner Joe Tsai's rift with Daryl Morey over pro-Hong Kong tweet, deep China ties highlighted in report", "body": "Brooklyn Nets team owner Joe Tsai’s ties with China came under scrutiny in a new report Thursday, days before the team plays the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs.Tsai, who was born in Taiwan, is a naturalized Canadian citizen who holds a Hong Kong passport. He is a co-founder and executive chairman of Alibaba and, in addition to the Nets, owns the WNBA’s New York Liberty and the San Diego Seals of the National Lacrosse League.His efforts to support the social justice movement in the U.S. come into conflict with statements he made about the personal freedoms of Chinese citizens and the silence around the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region of the Communist country.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15636_News_0>According to ESPN, the conflict reared its head most notably in 2019 when then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong protesters as the Nets were set to take on the Los Angeles Lakers in a preseason tour of the country. Morey tweeted, \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong,\" before deleting it after backlash.Supporters of the former Rockets general manager believed Tsai was pushing the league to fire Morey and push the league to offer a resounding apology to the Chinese government, ESPN reported. The assertions were reportedly denied.Brooklyn was also accused of refunding Morey's purchase of a Barclays Center suite when the Rockets came to town. Morey believed that Tsai had \"disinvited him\" but sources told ESPN that Tsai and the Nets were \"unaware\" of the decision, which was allegedly related to potential protests.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15636_News_1>Tsai had defended a national security law in Hong Kong in an interview on CNBC and defended China for cracking down on alleged \"separatists.\"\"What is this for? It's against sedition. It's against people that advocate splitting Hong Kong as a separate country. I want to make sure that we prevent foreign powers from carving up our territories. I think Hong Kong should be seen in that context,\" he said.Additionally, Tsai was asked about China cracking down on human rights issues but asked to clarify what the host was talking about. The way he saw it, \"the large number of the population – I'm talking about 80-90% of the population – are very, very happy for the fact that their lives are improving every year.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15636_News_2>While tensions allegedly boiled between Tsai and Morey, ESPN noted just how murky the waters the NBA is navigating are. A study says Alibaba is \"effectively state-controlled.\" That notion is underscored by co-founder Jack Ma’s disappearance from public view after he criticized China’s financial regulators in October 2020. It was only in October 2021 he reappeared in Hong Kong, Reuters reported.The technologies Alibaba helped produce were used for government surveillance, according to a congressional report in 2020. The technologies have been used to \"re-educate\" Uyghur Muslims and force millions into camps in the western part of China – something the Chinese government has denied.Tsai has been in full support of the NBA’s social justice movement. He and his wife Clara’s Social Justice Fund help fight racial injustice and plan for economic recovery in Brooklyn following the coronavirus pandemic. The two aim to end racism of all kinds against people of color.However, Tsai’s views about heavily surveilled citizens of China contrast heavily.He was asked in 2019 in a discussion at the University of California San Diego about the crackdowns on academic freedoms in China.\"It is what it is. The fact is, China today is a single-party system, so there's going to be restrictions on academic freedoms and freedom of expression. I mean, do people like that? I think most people don't like it, but I think that's how the Communist Party needs to control that in order to feel confident about pushing their policies in other areas,\" he said.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15636_News_3>\"The single-party system is in place because the elite in China feel that China is still a developing country, and I talked about two broader goals: to make sure that the population is wealthier and doing better and also to restore this sense of renaissance and pride about Chinese culture. They feel that dissent has to take a backseat and whatever they're doing is right.\"He told the Milken Institute in 2018 it was important for China to limit freedoms of its people.\"You need to understand that it is important for the Communist government that there's absolute stability in the country. In the American context, we talk about freedom of speech, freedom of press, but in the China context, being able to restrict some of those freedoms is an important element to keep the stability.\"In the fallout of the 2019 ordeal, Morey deleted the tweet and was forced to backtrack. He would eventually leave for the Philadelphia 76ers’ front office and hire Doc Rivers as their new head coach.Morey told ESPN in December 2020 he wasn’t tweeting out of jest. He said he knew the situation in Hong Kong well because of friends he had over there.\"I’m very comfortable with what I did,\" he said.He said at the time of the backlash he was fearful for his family.\"Luckily I had [access to] different people who were assisting me with that and giving me advice on how to handle it,\" he said. \"Hopefully, I've been able to get where we have some level of safety.\"\"But I was extremely concerned. You don’t want the second-most powerful government on Earth mad at you, if you can avoid it.

Any photo with Vestry routinely gets thousands of likes and comments on social media and because of that, the two teamed up with Milk-Bone to help launch the Birthday Cake Artificially Flavored Biscuits.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15693_News_0>Love gushed about Vestry in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. He said Vestry is a Hungarian Vizsla.\"They’re a hunting dog, a sport dog, but also they’re just the biggest sweethearts, male and female. They’re kind of like a mid-sized dog. Vestry is very small for her breed. She’s 35 pounds and it’s funny because she’s like a freak athlete,\" Love said. \"She’s a little bit of a tomboy. I think her relationship with (Love’s fiancée Kate Bock) is like ‘OK that’s mom. I love mom,’ and then I’m like her boyfriend. We wrestle and we fight and we play all the games together. It’s funny, the dynamic between the two, but then she just loves up on both of us. Vizslas are the quintessential Velcro dog. They’re attached to you or on you at all times. We love that because she’s like a weighted blanket and like a serotonin release for us at all times.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15693_News_1>Love said he was looking into getting a dog for about a year before coming across Vestry and the type of breed just checked off everything on his list.\"We were looking into getting a dog for maybe a year leading up to getting her. She’s three and a half now. We were looking into dogs with great temperament, easy to train, under 50 pounds, hypoallergenic,\" he said. \"We were looking for a number of things that we were gonna check off the list but when we saw Vizslas and just how sociable they are, how athletic they are, how they like to get out and run free, very happy family type dogs, just kind of checked every box for us, and we thought ‘OK let’s explore getting a Vizsla.’<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15693_News_2>\"We really took our time and just kept coming back to that breed and we’re so thankful that we did because we thought about getting her a brother or a sister and another companion to have around, but we will always, always have that breed for the best of my life.\"Love told Fox News Digital there was no tug-of-war between him and Bock about getting the dog. He said while he grew up around many pets, including cats, he was always a dog person.\"My family, we had all sorts of pets growing up, cats included. But I always just gravitated toward dogs. A Rottweiler was my first dog that my family had growing up. Then we had King Charles spaniels after that, which my family still has. Any now my brother has an Australian labradoodle. I think it was just an easy choice for me. I just always wanted a puppy. I always wanted a dog … and we kind of nailed it,\" he said.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15693_News_3>The Cavaliers center said having that type of companionship is something very special.\"The beauty of it is, she doesn’t care if I had a good or bad game and she does have the innate quality about her that I think it’s just the companionship and how much love that we give her and her undeniable sense of how we’re feeling, \"he said. \"She knows if I’m having anxiety or feeling bad or I’m hurt, or even on the other side of that if I’m excited or happy or all that. She’s really excited. Just coming home and getting that reaction of love …  I mean, you guys see the videos all the time on the internet and social media platforms like with the dogs just freaking out and their owner gets home. Without hesitation and every single time we come back, it could be five minutes or five days, she’s very excited to see us and just shows us with love, so we try to do the same.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15693_News_4>Vestry now gets to help other dogs celebrate their birthdays, or gotcha days, right.

Behind their run is a coach whose history as a gritty college player is helping this small New Jersey school reach improbable heights. A native New Yorker, Shaheen Holloway has always remained loyal to his roots. Born in Queens, Holloway played high school basketball just over the river in Elizabeth, New Jersey, at St. Patrick's, where he became regarded as one of the top prospects in the nation. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15728_News_0>After turning down offers to play at powerhouses like  and , Holloway attended  in New Jersey, where he played a pivotal role in ending a Pirates’ NCAA Tournament drought and became one of the program’s all-time greats.Holloway returned to New York to start his coaching career, making a name for himself at Iona College, his alma mater and, eventually, Saint Peter’s. \"That's who I am,\" Holloway told  in an interview this week. \"That's me as a person.

Holloway spoke highly of that 1996 team in an interview with  in 2020, recalling Kobe’s reaction to being snubbed for MVP. \"He was a competitor, he had that competitive spirit,\" Holloway said of Bryant. \"You’ve got to realize, the team that we had at the McDonald’s game in the east, there were so many big-time level guys. He took everything personal all the time, like he always wanted to be the best.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15728_News_2>Holloway had an immediate impact on the court as a freshman at Seton Hall, averaging 17.3 points, 6.3 assists, 2.8 steals and 3.8 rebounds per game and was named to the Big East All-Rookie team. He helped his team reach the Sweet 16 in 2000 before an injury ended his collegiate career. He finished his four years as the  with 681.

From around the country, nearly a dozen members of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps received fully paid homes.Severson and wife Sarah Arnold were the recipients of the 11th home this past Wednesday night at the Hornets game, when the campaign paid off their mortgage.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15900_News_0>Severson joined the military in the fall of 2018, but both he and his wife came from families who served this country. Arnold’s father was active duty in the Air Force and Severson’s father was in special forces.\"We were used to moving around to a new base every couple of years,\" Arnold told Fox News Digital.But it was at the U.S. base in Germany where Severson and Arnold first met.\"We actually met at the base's high school when we were 14 years old, and we were lab partners in biology together.\" Arnold said. \"I was always flirty with him.\"But it took them a little time to warm up to one another.\"We both had crushes on each other, but we were both too shy to make a move\" Severson said. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15900_News_1>After their encounter, their families moved to the next base, but they remained friends on Facebook and kept up with each other's lives from afar.\"I occasionally did a little Facebook stalking to see if he was dating anyone,\" Arnold told Fox News Digital. \"I always had a sentimental feeling when Severson reached milestones like graduating from college.\"In 2019, Arnold move to South Korea to teach English. A few months later, after finishing basic training, Severson received the orders that he would be stationed in South Korea.\"I didn't know anyone in South Korea, until I remembered that Sarah was living there,\" Severson said. \"I messaged her on Facebook.\"Severson told Fox News Digital that he \"felt very excited to meet up with Sarah again.\"On the first day that Severson was able to leave the base, he met up with Arnold.\"After a few dates, Forrest finally confessed to me that he had thought about me for many years and was really nervous to initially move to South Korea, but was excited to reconnect with me,\" she said. \"Forrest told me that he didn't want to miss the opportunity to be with me and do it right,\" Arnold said.\"We felt like fate had brought us back together. It was fireworks, like a movie,\" Arnold said.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15900_News_2>\"It was surreal to be with him again and it was so special to find someone who was also raised as a military brat,\" Arnold said. In order to be closer to the U.S. base where Severson was stationed, Arnold was looking to change jobs, when she got \"a feeling, an intuition, that we should just try to commit to each other.\" Severson's contract at the South Korea base and Arnold's teaching contract did not line up exactly.\"We didn't have a lot of stability geographically, we could have easily been separated again\" Severson said. \"We had talked about it, and we knew we wanted to get married to have that stability.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15900_News_3>In March 2020, COVID-19 began shutting down the world.\"On March 7, 2020, the day we got back from getting married, I looked at my inbox and I had new orders to report to Fort Bragg,\" Severson told Fox News Digital.They moved to North Carolina from South Korea, into a house they bought from across the world without ever stepping foot in it.\"We got incredibly lucky, we followed our intuitions and embraced spontaneity,\" Arnold said. \"I was forced to medically retire after sustaining several injuries in Korea. Both Sarah and I had many fears about paying off our new mortgage\" Severson said.\"We were facing many financial burdens since we were not anticipating Forrest needing to retire early,\" Arnold told Fox News Digital.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15900_News_4>It was Veterans Day 2021 when Severson saw and entered into the Veterans United Facebook post about the #ThanksToVeterans giveaway campaign.Arnold, however, was skeptical, \"I was a little concerned, thinking it was a scam, but I'm so happy that Forrest didn't listen to me and entered the giveaway!\"A few weeks later, Severson and Arnold received a phone call from Veterans United telling them that they were finalists in the home giveaway and requesting family and friends references. Severson and Arnold happily gave a few names of family and friends including their close friends Christian and Brittany Horsley. Little did they know they had already won the home giveaway -- but Veterans United wanted to surprise them.The Horsleys got to work creating the perfect surprise for their friends. Using a work promotion as a ruse, the Horsleys convinced Severson and Arnold that they were invited as special guests at the Charlotte Hornets NBA game. \"When we first got to the stadium there were cameras everywhere filming us going up to our box seats,\" Severson said. \"Our friends did an excellent job at surprising us with the home giveaway. We were 100% surprised when we found out we had won the fully paid home from Veterans United,\" Severson said. Severson and Arnold were told to come out to center court, where Bogues made a free throw to \"win\" the new home.\"At that moment, it clicked for us – we were so shocked,\" Severson said.Nearly 1,000 soldiers and military family members from Fort Bragg, along with about 500 veterans and their families from surrounding communities, were in attendance.Both Severson and Arnold said they are overwhelmed and extremely grateful to Veterans United.\"It was a lot to process, but we are so excited to what this means for our future and the financial freedom it gives us.

{"title": "Charles Oakley talks new book, case against Knicks and potentially fighting NBA legend", "body": "Charles Oakley backs down from no one. For him, it is second nature. In his memoir, \"The Last Enforcer,\" he says in most of his fights, the opposition starts it and he ends it.Oakley, who committed the fourth-most personal fouls in NBA history, was known for his physical play throughout his 19-year career and even after. He once busted Julius \"Dr. J\" Irving's lip during a retired NBA players' pickup. Although it was an accident, he doubles down on the fact that he does not \"give up layups.\" Whether he was Michael Jordan’s on-court bodyguard early in his career with the Chicago Bulls, Patrick Ewing’s defensive anchor with the New York Knicks or a veteran presence for a young Vince Carter and the Toronto Raptors in the late '90s, he was counted on and embraced his role as the enforcer.\"When you’re going into a tough situation, it always helps to have some protection, to have someone you can count on by your side, to have your back,\" Jordan says about Oakley in the memoir. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15942_News_0>Oakley, 58, came one game shy of winning an NBA championship with the Knicks in 1994, but fell short in a tough seven-game series against the Houston Rockets. Although he was traded to the Toronto Raptors in 1998, he was remembered as a beloved Knick for his toughness on the defensive end.  In 2017, Oakley was arrested and removed from Madison Square Garden during a Knicks game after the team stated he behaved in a \"highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner.\" Oakley was charged with assault and later countered with an ongoing civil lawsuit of his own. Despite the case, Oakley would \"love\" to see his jersey in the rafters of Madison Square Garden one day.In a phone interview with Fox News Digital, Oakley speaks to the roots of his fearless reputation as a protector, his altercations with Charles Barkley and how the NBA has changed since his heyday. Charles was one of those guys who had a big mouth once he got out the league. When he was in the league, his mouth wasn’t that big. I just had to set the record straight and this book will tell you a lot about me, not just setting the record straight but handling other people in situations too.   It could be free, Barkley or Shaq. Shaq always said I was number one on his list of guys he wanted to do something with, so this could be his chance. Shaq is a funny guy who has marketed himself into a different space. I give him credit for that, but he doesn’t want to mess with me.  He’s too small. It’ll be a first-round knockout. I guess it was one of those nights where … you know how it is where people try to put on in front of friends. He turned down the wrong block at nighttime, so he got carjacked.  He had eight kids and a big family he had to go and provide for. He had to protect them and not just his own kids but protect the neighborhood as well. He was a workaholic – I got a lot of my work ethic from him. He would give you his hat or shoes or anything you needed and didn’t tolerate any nonsense. I copied his blueprint, so I tried to emphasize his life in the book.  No, it wasn’t a flashback. One thing I try to tell people is, when I play, I play the same way. Whether it’s pickup, preseason, no matter what – that's my mindset. I was playing pickup, so you want to win at all times. In my mind, I always think to not give up an easy layup. It was a freak accident. I wasn’t trying to. … Doc is the Doc. When I was coming up he’d always talk to me, so I know Doc. It was an accident, but I don’t give up layups, so that’s what I told him.  <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15942_News_1> The case is going forward. It’s still in litigation. It’s something unfortunate that happened. In this book, I try to not really go there with that situation. Sometimes things happen and you can’t control it, so I wanted to talk about it for a little bit, but I wanted to express my feelings as a person who has made others better by being around them. With that (incident) it was just a bad situation.   I don’t know what happened. I was blindsided just like everybody else was. I was only there for like 10 minutes. But it was something that I can’t really say where it came from – why it was so personal. We know where it came from, but why? That’s what we’re trying to still figure out, but we’ll let the court figure that out. I try to go on with my life and show people I’m a better person than this guy has put me out there to be.   I spoke to Spike. It’s Spike Lee’s business to fight his fight, but I will always back Spike Lee because he backed me when in several situations. We tried to work things out. Spike Lee has gone back to watching games, so I guess everything is good with Spike Lee, but everything is not good with me yet.   <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15942_News_2>Magic Johnson is in a space by himself. What he has done – winning five championship rings and built his brand. Isiah still says stuff about how he was not selected for the (1992 Olympic) Dream Team, so he has to look at himself. If you’re a top five player in the league and no one likes you, then that’s on you. I always hear a lot of people who don’t have good things to say about Isiah. He is sneaky as far as I know. He’s a great player, but he’s still trying to get votes for not being selected for The Dream Team and that was almost 30 years ago. I’m a Knick at heart. They’ve gotten better over the past few years. I just want to see good basketball. New York fans want to see good basketball. It’s their heart. As someone who has played there and watched the games, fans want the team to be back on top. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15942_News_3> It’s a different game now. It used to be Boston and Lakers. The Knicks will never go away because of what it stands for. You have new teams on the rise – Phoenix, Cleveland, Chicago. They’re looking to get back into the conversation of being a good team.  Back in our era, you played within the team concept. You weren’t just taking threes. You took the best shot. Analytics say it’s best to take a three than a two. If you watch Milwaukee last year, the guys who scored 50 points were not taking 3 pointers.   He was our number one because he was our best player. If he went to another team, he would have been number two. My point was Patrick (Ewing) got numbers, but numbers should lead to wins and not losses. There were situations in the game where you need something to happen big – that’s when guys like Joe Burrow in Cincinnati or Patrick Mahomes – in football you can count on them.  To win a championship in this league, you have to go through adversity. Patrick never channeled adversity. If he did, it would’ve allowed the rest of the team to channel it more.  rd When you come into the league, it doesn’t hit you until four, five or six years into your career. You get better, along with hopes that the team you’re on gets better. Then a championship becomes a conversation. If you get lucky, like Magic (Johnson) who won a ring in his first year, but most of the time if you’re a top pick you don’t go to a team that’s built to win a championship.   In any ownership situation, you have to evaluate and ask why isn’t the team going forward. Sometimes when you’re not getting it right, you have to step down and let someone else get it right. Like when Larry Brown was in Detroit, he inherited the team from Rick Carlisle and won a championship the next year.   We went to a championship before but came up short. Our guys have to realize their strengths and weaknesses.It was there when I was playing. To each its own. If I saw a guy during my time playing that was open about it, I’d pull a red flag.   I didn’t see anyone physically doing it. When I came into the league, I couldn’t say anything. Once I grew into a leader, that was my time to speak up and advise them that they’re risking their career.   It depends on what you’re cooking. I’ve done a lot of barbecues. Even when I played in the league, I would invite the guys over to my house. When we traveled, I would always bring sandwiches to the locker room to show leadership. I cook for different charities as well. I picked that up from my mother and grandmother.  <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_15942_News_4> Before the pandemic I was there. I was also there when they won the championship. I went to three or four of the games, hung out with Drake – they showed me a lot of love.   He was a quiet assassin. He put the team on his back and Drake put the city on his back, so they had a one-two punch.   Brooklyn tried to do it last year, but they had injuries. It can happen though.  will be a free agent this year. It’s not a good look what’s going on in LA, but with a guy like LeBron you always have a chance to win.  Ja Morant is coming into his own. He’s taking the league by storm, so we’ll see over the next few years if he’ll be able to sustain that. I’ve known Anthony Edwards since he was in high school. He’s a freak of nature. He could be the next Vince Carter, but he has to stay healthy. The league is looking for the next superstar. They thought it was going to be Zion Williamson, but he’s hurt too.  It came up, but we never came to a conclusion. I would love for the fans and people in my corner to see my jersey retired one day. We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out. Like I said, we’re in litigation right now. As of right now, we don’t know. Bernard (King) has been in the Hall of Fame for five years, and his jersey hasn’t been retired. Bernard’s jersey will be retired before my jersey, so when Bernard goes up then you might see mine go up.

{"title": "High-profile Americans among China's network of international apologists", "body": "Many of the world's most high-profile cultural, political and business powerhouses are willing to downplay or outright ignore China's human abuses, which both the Trump and Biden administrations have said includes committing genocide against the Uyghur population. Even amid calls for the U.S. and other countries to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, China can still depend on friendly treatment from around the globe, including from high-profile Americans.  Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, who hasn't hesitated to take shots at Republican legislators and even Kyle Rittenhouse, has faced criticism for his posture toward the Chinese Communist Party.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_16314_News_0>In fact, James  Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey after Morey spoke out in support of Hong Kong protesters as the CCP seized power. \"I’m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,\" James initially said in a scrum with reporters in October of last year. \"I just think that, when you’re misinformed or you’re not educated about something – and I’m just talking about the tweet itself – you never know the ramifications that can happen.\"\"We all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that’s just a prime example of that.\"In fact, the NBA  came under fire after the organization called the Houston Rockets general manager’s post \"regrettable\" and said the post did not \"represent the Rockets or the NBA.\"Enes Kanter of the Boston Celtics — a vocal critic of James and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) -- recently criticized the Lakers star for his sneakers showing \"The King\" bowing down to Chinese President Xi Jinping.James isn’t the only player in the NBA kowtowing to the CCP, either — Brooklyn Nets star James Harden, while playing for the Rockets at the time, apologized to China for Morey’s comment.\"You know, we love China. We love playing there,\" Harden  in 2019.The Lakers did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.Republicans have accused Special Presidential Envoy for Climate  of lobbying against a congressional ban on Uyghur forced labor in order to protect climate talks. \"It doesn’t get worse than John Kerry,\" former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley previously told Fox News. \"He’s willing to accept Chinese slave labor to promote his radical climate agenda. What happened to defending human rights?\"Kerry raised eyebrows earlier this month while responding to a question about whether or not he discussed the issue of Chinese forced labor used in , like the production of solar panels.The climate envoy said U.S. concerns regarding forced labor have been \"articulated\" to Chinese officials, but added, \"That's not my lane here.\"A spokesperson for the State Department defended Kerry’s stance at the time saying, \"Secretary Kerry has a 37-year record as a senator and secretary of state standing up for human rights and defending democracy.\"As Secretary Kerry has said from the start, the United States and China have mutual interests in solving the climate crisis while there's still time, even when we fundamentally disagree on other critical issues,\" the spokesman added. <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_16314_News_1>The criticism came two months after Kerry answered a question about China's human rights abuses by explaining that \"life is always full of tough choices\" and that \"first and foremost, this planet must be protected.\" \"Well, life is always full of tough choices and the relationship between nations,\" Kerry said at the time.The former secretary of state then recalled when former President Reagan met with Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev at the Reykjavík Summit in 1986, which ultimately resulted in the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the two countries. Kerry said Reagan \"thought the Soviet Union was the Evil Empire\" and yet still was able to sit down at the table.\"The point I’m making is that even as there were egregious human rights issues, which Ronald Reagan called them out on it, we have to find a way forward to make the world safer, to protect our countries and act in our interests,\" he said.\"We can do and must do the same thing now,\" he continued. \"Yes we have issues, a number of different issues, but first and foremost, this planet must be protected.\"The World Health Organization's coziness with the CCP has been a recurring story line of the COVID-19 pandemic, right from the start. On Feb. 4, 2020, the WHO warned against banning travel to and from China even as COVID-19 cases surged past 20,000. In the ensuing months, the WHO was quick to steer critics away from accusations of a cover-up, praising the CCP's response instead. The WHO joint report with China on the origins of the pandemic this past July had glaring errors even after it was delayed multiple times, sparking concern that the CCP was trying to skew the report to shift blame for the pandemic away from China. Scrutiny of the report forced the WHO to promise to fix numerous \"unintended errors\" in the joint report with the communist party, including \"changing the virus sequence IDs associated with three of the 13 early patients listed in a chart in the report and will clarify that the first family cluster was not linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\"Most recently, while naming the new omicron coronavirus variant — all new strains have been named going down the Greek alphabet — the WHO opted to skip the letters \"nu\" and \"xi\" because \"'nu' is too easily confounded with ‘new,’ and ‘xi' was not used because it is a common last name.\" Observers were quick to point out that the Chinese president’s last name is Xi. The WHO did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.Nike CEO John Donahoe said on an earnings call in June that the shoe giant is \"a brand of China and for China.\"\"And the biggest asset we have in China is the consumer equity,\" Donahoe said. \"Consumers feel a strong, deep connection to the Nike, Jordan and Converse brands in China. And it's real.\"Donahoe went on to say that the company intended to keep investing in its China operations as it reported better-than-expected revenues in its fiscal fourth quarter at that time. Its sales in China missed Wall Street expectations.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.,  the shoe company for the CEO’s comments, quipping that Nike’s stance on the Uyghur Muslim genocide happening in the country runs parallel with its slogan.\"I guess Nike's attitude towards genocide in China is ‘just do it,’\" Cotton told \"Fox News Primetime\" host Jesse Watters, referencing the company's well-known slogan.Nike did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.Similar to Nike, Apple has faced many controversies over the company’s labor choices when it comes to overseas manufacturing in China.Between sweatshop , , and factory suicides, Apple has struggled to quell concerns of its supply chain practices. The company's closeness with the Chinese government, including in its data operations, has also alarmed human rights advocates for years. Apple has also folded to Chinese censorship demands time and time again, including in 2019 when it pulled an app used by Hong Kong protesters from its online store. The deletion came less than 24 hours after Apple was attacked by Chinese state media for not censoring the app. Apple did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.Disney  American media in Chinese markets to keep the CCP happy, going so far as to censor a Tiananmen Square joke from an episode of \"The Simpsons\" that was set in Hong Kong.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_16314_News_2>Disney's penchant for complying with China's communist censors is nothing new — the issue is so prominent that \"South Park\" famously  Disney and other Hollywood giants in a 2019 episode responding to Chinese censorship of the show. The company also came under fire last year after it was  that its live-action remake of the classic animated film \"Mulan\" was filmed in the Xinjiang region, where the CCP is alleged to have subjective Uyghurs to forced labor, forced political indoctrination, and .Disney CFO Christine McCarthy later  that the footage it took in the Xinjiang region has \"generated a lot of issues\" for the company — even though Disney gave a special thank-you to the CCP government in Xinjiang for letting it film there.Disney did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment.JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon recently made headlines after he apologized for a joke about the CCP. \"I made a joke the other day that the Communist Party is celebrating its 100th year - so is JPMorgan,\" Dimon said during an interview at Boston College last week. \"I'd make a bet that we last longer.\" <IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_16314_News_3>\"I can't say that in China,\" he added. \"They are probably listening anyway.\"A day later, Dimon walked back his comments -- the latest instance in a long line of doing so.\"I was trying to emphasize the strength and longevity of our company,\" he added.A JPMorgan spokesperson emphasized that Dimon \"acknowledges he should not speak lightly or disrespectfully about another country or its leadership\" and \"strongly supports a constructive and detailed economic dialogue with China.\" The reversal comes after Dimon made a visit to Hong Kong last week, his first since the COVID-19 pandemic began. During the 32-hour visit, Dimon stirred up controversy when he was able to skip quarantine after being granted an exemption by the Hong Kong government. Visitors typically are quarantined in a hotel for two to three weeks at their own cost. Recently, Dimon has looked to expand the investment bank's business in China. In March, JPMorgan announced a 10% stake in China Merchant Bank's wealth management unit.

I love you Detroit...”<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19606_News_1>Deals that included at least 41 players and 15 future draft picks were struck on either Wednesday or Thursday — the biggest move likely being the one Thursday that saw Andrew Wiggins going from Minnesota to the Warriors so D’Angelo Russell could leave Golden State and finally be paired with his good friend Karl-Anthony Towns with the Timberwolves.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19606_News_2>The Warriors decided to make the Russell-for-Wiggins move, giving Wiggins a fresh start that he likely needs — the former No. 1 overall pick will get to reap the benefits of playing alongside a healthy and rejuvenated Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green starting next season. And by throwing in a couple extra players, the Warriors also will likely escape the luxury tax this season. That’s not an insignificant point for a team that will go from five straight NBA Finals to the bottom of the Western Conference this season and, it hopes, back to title contention starting next year.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19606_News_3>Marcus Morris leaves New York for Los Angeles, going from the woebegone Knicks to the title-hopeful Clippers — who added a piece many teams wanted.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19606_News_4>Three-time champion Andre Iguodala is ending his exile and going to join the Heat along with Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill, with Miami sending three players who’ve combined to score a mere 254 points this season to Memphis for that trio.Miami’s trade with Memphis also lowered the Heat potential tax bill, and Portland made a minor trade with Atlanta with a lower tax in mind as well.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/nba-trade-deadline-2020-surprises", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_19606_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Andre Drummond.

{"title": "10 sports moments that defined the decade: From 'The Decision' to the national anthem protests", "body": "Sports have the ability to bring us closer together, but also to pull people further apart.The 2010s brought sports fans incredible moments from all sporting arenas. There have been plenty of upsets and things that had never been seen before. Some droughts were ended and new champions were crowned. And as the world got more politicized, so did the sports universe.Here are some of the biggest moments that defined the last 10 years.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_0>On July 8, 2010, LeBron James created his own spectacle announcing which team he was going to sign with during NBA free agency. James decided to join the Miami Heat and form a super team — one of the first that was formed with free agents collaborating on a landing spot. James was widely criticized as Cleveland Cavaliers fans notoriously burned his jersey.James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh would win two NBA championships during the \"Big Three\" era in Miami. James’ program raised millions for various charities but his reputation was tarnished over the announcement. His decision to join with Wade and Bosh was the beginning of the NBA empowerment era.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_1>Colin Kaepernick started a firestorm across all professional sports when he decided to protest during the national anthem. He first sat on the bench while “The Star-Spangled Banner” blared during a preseason game in 2016 then he kneeled during the anthem the following week.He knelt during the anthem to raise awareness for perceived social injustices across the U.S. His protest sparked other players in the NFL to follow and other players in several other sports to use their platform to raise awareness for social justice causes.However, Kaepernick was seeking a new team after the 2016 season and has yet to find one. Despite a major marketing push from Nike and plenty of quarterback injuries from 2017 to 2019, Kaepernick has yet to find a home. He had filed a grievance against the NFL accusing owners of blackballing him from the league, which was later settled. He hosted a workout in 2019 to showcase his talents but no team has picked up the phone to sign him.Kaepernick’s fight to get back to the NFL continues while his activism is ongoing off the field.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_2>In 2019, Tiger Woods won the Masters for the first time since 2005 and captured his first major victory since 2008 — his 15th overall. He inched closer to Jack Nicklaus’ record for most major victories in a career. He also put himself back on top of the sport he dominated for so long before falling off because of scandal and injuries.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_3>The Chicago Cubs ended a 108-year drought in 2016 when they defeated the Cleveland Indians to win the World Series. The Cubs beat the Indians in seven games — coming back from a 3-1 deficit in the series itself. The Cubs held a victory parade in Chicago. The city estimated that more than 5 million people attended the parade.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_4>Until the 2018 NCAA men’s basketball tournament, a No. 16 seed had not beaten a No. 1 seed. The UMBC Retrievers broke the spell beating Virginia 74-54 for the biggest upset in men’s college basketball history. UMBC would go on to lose in the second round but history remains intact.Virginia would have redemption a season later, coming back to win their first national championship.Odell Beckham Jr. will forever live in the annals of NFL history forever thanks to the incredible catch he made as a member of the New York Giants playing against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Beckham somehow made a one-handed touchdown grab while diving backward and getting interfered with.Whatever Beckham does with his career from here on out, he will be remembered for one of the greatest catches in the history of the NFL.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_5>Simone Biles is arguably the most dominant athlete of the decade. While Biles is thrust into the national spotlight once every four years, she makes the most of it. In the 2010s, Biles became the most decorated American gymnast and third-most decorated gymnast of all-time.Biles took home four gold medals and one bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Games. From 2013 to 2019, she’s won 19 gold medals at the World Championships and two gold medals at the Pacific Rim championships. She also became the most decorated gymnast at the world championships with 25 total medals.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_6>LeBron James might have been enemy No. 1 for a lot of NBA fans when he signed with the Miami Heat but he redeemed himself in many eyes when he returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers and led them to an NBA title.James helped the Cavaliers to an NBA title in 2016 – the franchise’s first. Cleveland overcame a 3-1 deficit to defeat the Golden State Warriors. He also had an iconic moment in Game 7 of the series with his run-down block of Warriors guard Andre Iguodala. James captured his third ring. He would later sign with the Los Angeles Lakers.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_7>The U.S. women’s soccer team ran through the 2019 Women’s World Cup en route to their second consecutive tournament title. However, it didn’t come without controversy.At the height of it was Alex Morgan scoring a goal against England and pretending to sip a cup of tea. The celebration caused a firestorm throughout the sport and put the U.S. under fire. Morgan defended herself saying there was a “double standard” for female athletes celebrating.“You see men celebrating all around the world in big tournaments, grabbing their sacks or whatever it is and when I look at sipping a cup of tea, I’m a little taken aback and kind of … You have to laugh about it, to see all the criticism,” she told The Guardian.Even with the scathing criticism, the U.S. defeated the Netherlands in the World Cup final.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_19769_News_8>Leicester City’s run through the English Premier League during the 2015-16 season proved to be one of the biggest upsets in any professional sports league ever. The club was 5,000-1 odds to start the season and ended up finishing in first place in the Premier League and earning their first-ever spot in the UEFA Champions League.At that point, the club had not finished better than second since 1929 and it was the first time the league had seen a first-time champion since Nottingham Forest in 1978.

{"title": "Hong Kong protesters slam LeBron James' criticism of Daryl Morey tweet: 'People are angry'", "body": "It's not the first time LeBron James has seen people burn his jersey because of something he's said.But previous instances of fiery fan discontent involved the NBA superstar switching squads -- the backlash Tuesday was a matter of global politics and had the potential to be a far more lasting stain on the perennial All-Star's career ledger. James caused seething outrage in Hong Kong after he said Monday night Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was “misinformed” when he tweeted his support for the pro-democracy protesters. James doubled down in a series of tweets later, again saying Morey decision to tweet the message on the eve of the NBA's exhibition trip to China was bad timing.In response, a large group among the throngs of Hong Kong demonstrators were seen stomping on jerseys and shirts bearing the superstar's name -- and even gathered to watch the burning of one of the garments.<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_20000_News_0>James, who has been one of the most outspoken athletes on social justice issues in the U.S. in a league that prides itself on being one of the most progressive in sports, was deferential to the NBA and the Chinese government when he broke his silence about Morey’s remarks days after his return to the U.S. after playing two preseason games in China. Morey had tweeted, “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,” last week prior to the Rockets’ preseason games in Japan.The tweet had consequential effects on the NBA’s bottom line, with the Chinese government blacking out games on its streaming service Tencent and several Chinese sportswear brands suspending or cutting ties with the Rockets. It was in that climate that James made his first comments about the controversy Monday night.“I’m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,” he told reporters. “I just think that, when you’re misinformed or you’re not educated about something – and I’m just talking about the tweet itself – you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that’s just a prime example of that.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_20000_News_1>He added in a tweet: “My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.”In Hong Kong, protesters blasted James’ message.“People are angry,” said James Lo, a web designer who runs a basketball fan page on Facebook. He added he expects more backlash from protesters who have been demonstrating on the streets and battling police because of concerns that the international business hub is losing its freedoms.“Students, they come out like every weekend,” James Lo said. “They've got tear-gassed and then they got gun-shot, like every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like every day. And then he just comes up with something [like that tweet]. We just can't accept that.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_20000_News_2>Protesters also said that James’ comments amounted to a double-standard because the Los Angeles Lakers star has used his fame and celebrity to press for social issues unique to the U.S.“Please remember, all NBA players, what you said before: 'Black lives matter.' Hong Kong lives also matter!” William Mok said to an applauding crowd of protesters.Others said James was likely more worried about protecting his wealth than the geopolitical issues of his Hong Kong supporters.“James was trying, you know, to take a side, on the China side, which is like ridiculous,” Aaron Lee, a 36-year-old marketing director, said. “He was being honest, financially. Financial is money. Simple as that. LeBron James stands for money. Period.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NBA_20000_News_3>Before wading into the Hong Kong controversy, James had been vocally supportive of social justice causes. On his HBO discussion show, \"The Shop,\" James in March discussed his respect for former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started the trend of taking a knee during the national anthem to draw attention to perceived racial biases in the justice system. But Kaepernick soon found himself without a job, as NFL franchises uniformly declined to bring the lightning rod player aboard.\"Kap stood for something that was bigger than him,\" James said. \"How many people can wake up and say 'You know what, I'll give up everything that I've worked for my whole life, for the better of the conversation. I'm gonna lose everything I've got personally to better the conversation?'\"In January 2018, James tweeted a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: \"-Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere- Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter- #ThankYouMLK50.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/lebron-james-hong-kong-protesters-tweet-nba-anger", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NBA_20000_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "A demonstrator stomps on Lebron James jerseys during a rally at the Southorn Playground in Hong Kong, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019.

{"title": "Penguins ink head coach Mike Sullivan to a 3-year extension", "body": "Mike Sullivan doesn’t believe coaches have a \"shelf life.\"Apparently, neither do his bosses.The Pittsburgh Penguins signed their two-time Stanley Cup-winning head coach to a contract extension on Tuesday that runs through the 2026-27 season, a pact that doubled as a vote of confidence in the club’s iconic core of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang and the fiery Sullivan’s ability to lead them.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20096_News_0>Sullivan still had two years remaining on his current contract. Yet Fenway Sports Group, which purchased the Penguins from Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux and Ron Burkle last fall, saw enough to lock down the winningest coach in franchise history for the long term.The 54-year-old Sullivan joined Pittsburgh in December 2015. If he reaches the end of his new deal, it means he’ll have spent more than a decade with the Penguins, a nearly unheard of tenure in the NHL.Then again, Sullivan believes he’s in a nearly unheard-of situation.\"I think I had the luxury of inheriting a standard of excellence, a certain culture that has been developed in Pittsburgh,\" Sullivan said. \"I feel the need to be the custodian of that.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20096_News_1>Sullivan’s 297 regular-season wins are a franchise record. His 44-38 playoff mark includes Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017. The Massachusetts native is the only American-born coach with multiple Cups and he’s one of only two coaches in NHL history to win the Cup in each of his first two seasons with a team.\"He has clearly demonstrated what an effective leader he is,\" said Fenway Sports Group owner John Henry. \"And it’s evident how well players respond to his philosophy and work ethic night after night, month after month.\"Even if, on the surface, it looks like an odd marriage. Of styles anyway.The grinder who spent a decade in the NHL willfully doing the dirty work others wouldn’t or couldn’t in order to cling to a roster spot leads a group of such preternatural ability it often leaves Sullivan shaking his impeccably coiffed head.\"I wish I could play the game the way that this group of players can play,\" Sullivan said.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20096_News_2>He couldn’t. Yet the center who mustered all of 54 goals in 11 seasons has found a way to connect with the generational talents that dot Pittsburgh’s roster. Asked to explain what’s allowed him to thrive in a position that is long on burnout and short on sustained success and Sullivan points not to Xs and Os but something deeper.\"I just believe in being honest and candid with our players,\" he said. \"I think an important aspect of what we do is building relationships ... When relationships grow and develop over the course of time they should get stronger.\"Particularly during times of adversity, something that’s become familiar in recent years in Pittsburgh. The Penguins haven’t reached the second round of the playoffs since 2018 and saw a promising season come to an end under somewhat bizarre circumstances last spring in a seven-game loss to the New York Rangers in the opening round.In the aftermath, the players to a man stressed the club’s championship window remained open, even with Crosby, Letang and Malkin all in their mid-30s. Management apparently agreed, signing Letang and Malkin to lengthy extensions in July. Now, they’ve followed suit by doing the same to the coach whose \"play the right way\" ethos doesn’t seem to have grown stale.\"It’s about selling the message,\" Sullivan said. \"It’s about making sure that whatever you’re trying to sell, they’ve got to buy in. They have to believe to their very core that this is the game plan that is going to give us the best chance of success.\"And success remains the standard for a team that’s reached the playoffs 16 straight years, the longest active streak in North American professional sports. Yet Sullivan is well aware the standard isn’t simply reaching the postseason, but staying awhile.While he’s well aware of the advancing age of his superstars, he’s bullish on the future.\"I believe these guys can still play,\" he said of Crosby, Letang and Malkin. \"They’ve shown no signs of decline. I have the opportunity to watch these guys every day. I know the sacrifices they make.\"The past seven-plus years have given Sullivan an opportunity to watch those sacrifices up close. There have been tense moments. Difficult conversations. Tough decisions. Success can be fickle. Longevity perhaps even more so. The new contract won’t be worth much if the Penguins don’t win and win at a high level.Bring it on.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20096_News_3>\"I just love what I do. I love being a part of it. I love being in the heat of the battle,\" he said. \"It’s part of my DNA I guess.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/penguins-ink-head-coach-mike-sullivan-3-year-extension", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20096_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "(L-R) Evgeni Malkin #71, Sidney Crosby #87, Kris Letang #58 of the Pittsburgh Penguins and their teammates line up for the singing of the National Anthem prior to the 2019 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers at Lincoln Financial Field on February 23, 2019 in Philadelphia.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20096_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1126985636.jpg"}, {"caption": "Evgeni Malkin #71 of the Pittsburgh Penguins reacts after scoring a goal in Game Six of the First Round of the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs against the New York Rangers at PPG PAINTS Arena on May 13, 2022 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20096_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Evgeni-Malkin-Celebrates-2jpg-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "FILE - Pittsburgh Penguins coach Mike Sullivan directs a power play during the second period of the team's NHL hockey game against the Florida Panthers in Pittsburgh, Tuesday, March 8, 2022.

She joined Castonguay with the Canucks in February.\"There were times I didn’t think that was an option for women,\" Granato said. \"It wasn’t something that I thought would happen in my lifetime because I’ve always been the one sort of in that age of ‘the first of things’ and sometimes those things don’t come.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20111_News_2>MEGHAN HUNTERA finalist for top college player of the year, Hunter moved into coaching women's hockey at the University of Wisconsin: \"I just naturally gravitated into coaching because that’s all I really thought was available at the time.\"Hunter spent time with the Ontario Hockey League's London Knights and Hockey Canada, joined the Blackhawks in an administrative role in 2016 and climbed the ranks in scouting and hockey operations. Chicago promoted her to AGM in June.\"My path’s never been linear,\" Hunter said. \"I wanted to play in the NHL, so then when I realized that wasn’t a reality, I was like, ‘Wow, if I work in it, that’s pretty cool.’\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20111_News_3>HAYLEY WICKENHEISERAn early rival of Granato's, Wickenheiser is one of the best hockey players Canada has ever produced.

He spent his first 14-plus seasons in Philadelphia, where he served as the Flyers captain, before being traded to Florida in March.\"I wouldn’t sign here if I didn’t think we had a chance to win the Cup,\" Giroux told Canada’s TSN. \"I’m not saying we’re going to win the Cup this year, but the plan is to build on it and have baby steps for that.\"Giroux has topped 20 goals nine times, and finished second in the NHL scoring race with 102 points in 2017-18.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20116_News_1>Campbell leaves the Toronto Maple Leafs for Edmonton, where he is projected to compete for the Oilers starting job after veteran Mike Smith’s playoff inconsistencies led to the Oilers being outscored 22-13 in being swept by Colorado in the Western Conference finals.

{"title": "How the stars aligned for Paul Maurice to become Panthers head coach", "body": "Paul Maurice’s journey toward becoming the new coach of the Florida Panthers included a fortuitous flick of the remote control, plus was aided by a college admissions department.He was watching games one night in January, a month or so after he stepped aside as coach of the Winnipeg Jets. He stumbled upon the Panthers and quickly told his wife that he was intrigued by their club.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_0>Fast forward a few weeks, and Maurice’s son got admitted to the University of Miami. It was another sign.\"I’m thinking, ‘Hey, this could be good,’\" Maurice said.The Panthers hope he’s right. Maurice was introduced Thursday as Florida’s new coach, with the team emphasizing it found in a monthlong search his experience — he has the fourth-most games and seventh-most wins of any coach in NHL history — makes him the right fit.\"When we spoke to Paul Maurice, it was overwhelming that this was the man to be a real fit,\" Panthers general manager Bill Zito. \"He was the fit to take us into the challenges that are ahead of us moving forward, as we move forward to ultimately what our goal is.\"Zito called Maurice last week to start the interview process, which led to his hiring. Zito was a longtime agent in the NHL but had never actually met Maurice, though had several players who had played for him through the years.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_1>Whatever Zito said to Maurice worked, and worked quickly.\"The interview process was wonderful,\" Maurice said. \"I don’t know how much time you spend with Bill, but he can jack you up about hockey in about 15 minutes, right? So, I’m in a lather an hour into the meeting and ready to go. And that’s what drives me, and that’s what I love. Really smart, passionate people that want to put on not just a great game, but a great program for the community.\"The Panthers will become the fourth franchise that Maurice coaches. He started in Hartford in 1995, two seasons before that franchise relocated to Carolina. He coached Toronto for two seasons before returning to Carolina, then spent nearly nine years as coach in Winnipeg before stepping down there in December.Maurice simply felt like he needed a break. And then he watched the Panthers play from his couch about a month later. He no longer needed a break, and that feeling was cemented when he began his talks with Zito.\"They’re working on things,\" Maurice said. \"They have a plan if this happens, a plan if this happens. And they’re ready to work and you know right away, ‘I want to be a part of this.’ So that switch got flipped real fast and it wasn’t from, ‘I’m not coaching anymore.’ It was, ‘I’m only going to a place that I think I can make a difference.’\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_2>Maurice has been an NHL head coach for the better part of 30 years, and has yet to win a Stanley Cup.Same goes for the Panthers. They made the final in 1996, were moribund for most of the next quarter-century, then got things rolling in recent years, won the Presidents’ Trophy this season and have most of their star core — Aleksander Barkov, Jonathan Huberdeau, Aaron Ekblad, Sergei Bobrovsky and more — under contract for at least next season.They have some roster questions, some salary-cap complexities to navigate this summer and it remains unclear if Andrew Brunette — who was promoted from assistant to interim coach when Joel Quenneville had to step down last fall — will be back with Florida. The Panthers want him to stay, as does Maurice.But the end goal is clear: The only thing that’ll make next year an absolute success is hockey’s ultimate prize, and Maurice says he’s raring to get started.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_3>\"Certainly, that is the aspiration and where we want to get to,\" Maurice said. \"But we can’t make a Cup run in October, or in training camp. So, what we have to do from Day One, and a daily basis, is prepare in that work. And that has to be our focus. We’re not coming in Day One and say, ‘We’re gonna win the Stanley Cup’ because we can’t win it that day.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/stars-aligned-paul-maurice-head-coach-florida-panthers", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Paul Maurice, right, is introduced as the new head coach of the Florida Panthers by general manager Bill Zito, during an NHL hockey news conference at FLA Live Arena, Friday, June 23, 2022, in Sunrise, Fla.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Zito-and-Paul-Maurice-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Bill Zito, left, general manager of the Florida Panthers, and Paul Maurice, new head coach of the Panthers, take questions during an NHL hockey news conference at FLA Live Arena, Friday, June 23, 2022, in Sunrise, Fla.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/BIll-Zito-talking-with-his-hands-copy-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "Paul Maurice, right, is introduced as the new head coach of the Florida Panthers by general manager Bill Zito, during an NHL hockey news conference at FLA Live Arena, Friday, June 23, 2022, in Sunrise, Fla.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Zito-and-Maurice-again-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Paul Maurice, right, new head coach of the Florida Panthers, and general manager Bill Zito take questions during an NHL hockey news conference at FLA Live Arena, Friday, June 23, 2022, in Sunrise, Fla.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20148_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Bill-Zito-talking-copy.jpg"}]}

{"title": "Mark Messier talks humble beginnings, teamwork and leadership in new memoir", "body": "Mark Messier’s legendary  career is defined by the dynasty he helped to build with the , where he would win five  from 1984-1990 before adding one more with the  in 1994, finally ending New York City’s 54-year drought. But before the glory and before the accomplishments, came humble beginnings that shaped one of hockey’s most iconic players. In his new book titled \"No One Wins Alone,\" Messier talks about growing up in Alberta, Canada, as the son of a hard-knocks hockey player and coach, his beginnings with Wayne Gretzky, his journey through the NHL, and everything in between. \"I’ve been asked to write a book for many years and never really thought about it or had any inspiration to write a book,\" Messier told Fox News in a recent phone interview. \"I didn’t want to write just another hockey book.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20847_News_0>Messier explained that when he really thought about all of his experiences, both on and off the ice, that’s when writing a book finally made sense. \"It's part childhood, part leadership, part psychology and I think that interested me more than just writing a hockey book or a memoir.\"One storyline focuses on Messier’s beginnings with the Oilers and, of course, playing with Gretzky. \"When I first heard about Wayne when he was 9 years old,\" Messier told Fox News. \"I think [the media] did a big write-up -- I grew up on the West Coast, he grew up on the East Coast – The Canadian Magazine had done a big expose on him, scoring 380 goals in a season … you know, and then playing junior hockey at 14 and all that.\" Messier writes about how their early careers seemed to orbit one another: junior hockey, the World Hockey Association and eventually the NHL.\"I don't think I ever really tried to compare myself to Wayne -- in a way you compare yourself to everybody you’re playing with or against in some fashion, I guess, because there’s a barometer there whether you’re good enough to play at any league, so I guess there’s that.\" <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20847_News_1>He continued: \"Wayne and I were so different in the roles on the team that the compatibility from a professional standpoint was obviously great and then of course becoming the great friends we did was really one of the highlights of my career.\" Perhaps the biggest theme in Messier’s book is teamwork and what can be accomplished when talent meets cohesion.  \"As the book says ‘no one wins alone.’ You need everyone on the team to be accountable. You need everybody on the team to be effective. Great teams and great players and great leaders have the ability to make people around them better. Inclusiveness.\"The best example of this was Gretzky’s trade to the  in 1988, a massive blow to the Oilers dynasty that saw four Stanley Cups in just five years, two back-to-back runs. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20847_News_2>\"The quick answer character, grit, determination, that’s what that '90s team was all about,\" Messier told Fox News when asked how the team was able to pull off a fifth championship following Gretzky’s departure. \"The first year was a bit of a transition for us, obviously, with Wayne leaving. And so when I think of that '90 Cup, I just think about grit, character, determination -- that kind of sums that team up.\"Messier’s book, which goes on sale Oct. 26, goes into detail about the ups and downs in the years after that last Cup. He discusses the moment he knew his time in Edmonton had finally come to an end and how that opened another door with an even bigger challenge ahead. The book goes beyond Messier's hockey career, discussing his travels, thoughts, and more. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20847_News_3>\"It was fun [but] it was really hard. It was really hard work.

{"title": "NHL 2021-22 Central Division preview: Coyotes overhaul after realignment", "body": "The NHL 2021-22 season kicks off on Tuesday with a full 82-game schedule set to run until April 29. This year 32 teams, with the addition of the , will battle it out with the hopes of hoisting the coveted  in what will be the first regular season since the pandemic struck mid-season in March 2020. The league is split into the Eastern and Western conferences and returns to its original four divisions, the Atlantic, Metropolitan, Central and Pacific, with eight teams in each. Read below for a breakdown of the Central Division.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_0>The Avalanche boasted the best record in the NHL last season after going 39-13-4, so it was a bit of a surprise when they lost in the second round to the , although Nazem Kadri’s suspension seemed to play a large role in that. Colorado stands a good chance of winning the division again, but the pressure will be on the top line to produce after Joonas Donskoi was picked up by the Kraken in the expansion draft and Brandon Saad signed with the division-rival Blues over the summer. That shouldn’t be much of a problem, though. Mikko Rantanen led the team in points with 30 goals and 36 assists in the shortened season. Nathan MacKinnon also led the team in assists with 65 points.Boston College standout Alex Newhook could fill a void left on Colorado’s top two lines. Drafted in 2019, Newhook signed a three-year deal with the Avalanche back in March and played well in the minors before being called up last season. The biggest hurdle for sure will be overcoming Philipp Grubauer’s absence in the net after a strong campaign in 2020. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_1>The Stars' 2020 season was defined by a failed playoff attempt, injuries and a COVID-19 outbreak. After losing in the Stanley Cup finals to  the season before, the Stars are in a make-or-break situation. Boasting one of the more mature rosters in the league, the Stars have premier players like Joe Pavelski, 37, Alexander Radulov, 35, and Ryan Suter, 36, all of which could be slowing down in the next few seasons. On the bright side, Tyler Seguin will make a return after being sidelined most of last season following multiple hip and knee surgeries, and Radulov will also return after undergoing core muscle surgery. Jason Robertson is also expected to have a bigger role this year after a solid rookie season. The only thing standing in the way is perhaps Dallas’ goaltending situation. Ben Bishop’s health concerns led to Braden Holtby’s signing in the offseason, but he joins Jake Oettinger and Anton Khudobin on a crowded bench. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_2>The Jets finished third in their division with a 30-23-3 finish, but after sweeping the  in the first round, Winnipeg would go on to get swept by the Canadiens in the very next series. Scoring wasn't much of a problem for the Jets, so the offseason was dedicated to beefing up the defense and giving Connor Hellebuyck some gritty players in front of the net. Brenden Dillon was traded from the  in exchange for two secondround picks in the next two drafts and should fill that role nicely while Nate Schmidt, who was acquired from the Canucks, brings speed and mobility. All eyes will be on forward Pierre-Luc Dubois to see if he can rebound from last season’s woes. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_3>Chicago has been in a slump since winning the Stanley Cup in 2015. Three first-round exits and three more fruitless seasons have defined the Blackhawks over the course of the last six years, but this could be a breakout season amid a rebuild.For starters, Jonathan Toews returns this season and is expected to play the season opener on Wednesday against the Avalanche after missing all of last year with chronic immune response syndrome. If he can stay healthy, Toews will have an immediate impact in improving Chicago’s odds of making a deeper playoff run.The Blackhawks have also added some major players across the board. Among the most notable are Vezina Trophy winner Marc-Andre Fleury, two-time Stanley Cup champion Tyler Johnson and defenseman Seth Jones. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_4>The Blues have taken some hard hits in the offseason, coupled with lingering injuries that could see them drop to the middle of the pack. The biggest hit was the departure of Jaden Schwartz after 10 seasons. He helped the Blues earn the franchise’s first Stanley Cup back in 2019, but after his contract ended last season, the veteran winger signed a major five-year, $27.5 million contract with the Kraken. In his place comes Brandon Saad via free agency and former  forward Pavel Buchnevich. Star defenseman Colton Parayko found himself on long-term injured reserve last season with an upper-body injury but returns this season healthy. Last month he signed an eight-year, $52 million contract extension.There’s a dark cloud lingering over the Blues heading into the season after Vladimir Tarasenko requested a trade back in May over the handling of his shoulder surgeries. His commitment to the team is a legitimate concern, but he told reporters ahead of training camp that he is \"100%\" in. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_5>The Wild finished third in their division with a 33-16-5 record before being eliminated in the first round by the Golden Knights. There were significant changes on the blue line that could disrupt their memento, but there’s also a good chance that the players coming in could improve upon last season’s progress. Minnesota bought out the final four years of Zach Parise and Ryan Suter’s contract, the latter being the most surprising, and lost Ian Cole to free agency while Carson Soucy was picked up by the Kraken. The Wild have made up for Suter’s departure with some free-agent additions, but perhaps the most promising feature of the team is Calder Trophy winner Kirill Kaprizov, who signed a five-year deal last month. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_6>The Predators have made the playoffs every year for the past eight seasons, but just how attainable the Cup is, remains a mystery. After ranking 19th in goals scored, Nashville opted to trade away some of its more veteran players to build a younger squad. They picked up two draft picks in exchange for Viktor Arvidsson and acquired Cody Glass and Philippe Myers from the Flyers after trading off Ryan Ellis. Juuse Saros adds some stability in the net. He had a 2.28 goals-against average and a .927 save percentage in 36 games in his first season as starter. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_7>The addition of the Kraken as the NHL 32nd franchise has sent the Coyotes packing to the Central Division and with that a major overhaul. The Coyotes have used some of their bigger names to create draft capital and bring in younger players who can grow with the organization. They traded top defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson to the  in July in exchange for Jay Beagle, Loui Eriksson, Antoine Roussel, 2021 first-round pick Dylan Guenther, and a 2022 second-round and 2023 seventh-round pick. Arizona got two more picks in exchange for goalie Darcy Kuemper and another for Adin Hill, just to name a few.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/nhl-2021-22-central-division-coyotes-realignment", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Oct 7, 2021; Dallas, Texas, USA; Colorado Avalanche goaltender Darcy Kuemper (35) faces the Dallas Stars attack during the second period at the American Airlines Center.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-08T014906Z_963141537_MT1USATODAY16909777_RTRMADP_3_NHL-PRESEASON-COLORADO-AVALANCHE-AT-DALLAS-STARS.jpg"}, {"caption": "Oct 7, 2021; Dallas, Texas, USA; Dallas Stars goaltender Anton Khudobin (35) and right wing Alexander Radulov (47) celebrate the win over the Colorado Avalanche at the American Airlines Center.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-08T023956Z_772712821_MT1USATODAY16910252_RTRMADP_3_NHL-PRESEASON-COLORADO-AVALANCHE-AT-DALLAS-STARS.jpg"}, {"caption": "Oct 8, 2021; Calgary, Alberta, CAN; Winnipeg Jets center Pierre-Luc Dubois (80) during the warmup period against the Calgary Flames at Scotiabank Saddledome.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20866_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-09T012807Z_310237291_MT1USATODAY16916026_RTRMADP_3_NHL-PRESEASON-WINNIPEG-JETS-AT-CALGARY-FLAMES.jpg"}, {"caption": "Oct 9, 2021; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Blackhawks center Jonathan Toews (19) sits during a time out during the third period at United Center.

The league is split into two conferences: the Eastern and Western Conferences and returns to its original four divisions: the Atlantic, Metropolitan, Central and Pacific, with eight teams in each. Read below for a breakdown of the Pacific Division.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_0>Largely considered the weakest division in the league, the Pacific also houses one of the best teams in the NHL: the Golden Knights.  Since its inception in 2017, Vegas has made the playoffs every season, even reaching the Stanley Cup Final in their inaugural season. Last season, the Knights finished second in their division with a 40-14-2 record. Part of what’s made this possible is Vegas’ \"go big or go home\" mentality. Vegas will be missing a big piece of their Stanley Cup puzzle with the trading of Marc-Andre Fleury. Robin Lehner, who was acquired in a trade with the , is taking over and even though he helped Vegas reach the conference final in 2020, Fleury’s shoes will be hard to fill. The Knights have also attempted to solve their power play issues in the offseason with the additions of Evgenii Dadonov and Nolan Patrick. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_1>And then there were 32.

Questions about unity and chemistry will of course be the main concerns but Seattle will also have the pressure of living up to the history set by division-rival Vegas: four seasons, four playoff appearances. Seattle chose their star players from the goal up. Vezina Trophy finalist Philipp Grubauer will be in the net after leaving the  following a solid year. He went 30-9-1 with a league-best of 1.95 goals against average and tied the league lead for shutouts with seven. Top defenseman and newly named team captain Mark Giordano followed suit after getting picked up in the expansion draft where the Kraken also picked up Jamie Oleksiak, signing him to a five-year $23 million contract. Jaden Schwartz, Jared McCann, Jordan Eberle are the projected top line but Seattle’s defense should be the star of the show. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_2>The same team that produced the dynasty of Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier has now made just two playoff appearances over the last 15 years. While this seems bad for the Oilers, a closer look reveals a team with stunning potential.Last season, Edmonton finished second in the division but was swept by the Jets in the first round. The season before that also featured a second-place finish but the Oilers lost in the qualifying round -- a technicality of the season altered by the pandemic. So you have a team with strong regular season performances but can’t seem to translate that to the playoffs. The Oilers have Connor McDavid. Pretty simple. He was awarded the Hart Trophy after putting up 105 points with 33 goals and 72 assists but you can’t win a cup with just one player. To help, the Oilers added Zach Hyman who had 33 points with the  last season, Warren Foegele who had 20 with the  and Derek Ryan who had 13. Not astounding numbers on their own but certainly dangerous when put together. ***<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_3>The Canucks missed the playoffs last season after finishing seventh in their division with a 23-29-4 record. In fact, Vancouver has only made the playoffs twice in the last eight years with just one second-round appearance. A major overhaul in the offseason seems to be working towards that but defense stands to be the biggest issue plaguing the Canucks this season. Travis Hamonic won't be on the ice for the season opener after being placed on waivers, the team announced Monday. Olli Juolevi was traded to Florida for forward Juho Lammikko and defenseman Noah Juulsen and Tucker Poolman will have to deal with the pressures of overcoming a lackluster year. Oliver Ekman-Larsson should freshen things up after being acquired in a trade from the . <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_4>Kings’ captain Anze Kopitar says Los Angeles is done with the rebuild and ready to \"make some noise,\" and Los Angeles has certainly taken the steps in the offseason to make the case for being serious playoff contenders this season. The Kings went straight to the vets to draw out an immediate impact. Kopitar and Dustin Brown will be joined by Phillip Danault and Viktor Arvidsson while veteran Alexander Edler comes in to offer direction for the younger defenseman.The Kings will likely split goaltending duties between Jonathan Quick and Calvin Petersen, although 2021 could prove to be a transitional year. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_5>The Flames are one of the teams this year whose season could legitimately go either way: boom or bust. The focus will be on the team’s forwards to sway that in Calgary’s favor. Despite the shortened season, Johnny Gaudreau was way off the mark on scoring last season. He had 49 points (19 goals and 30 assists) compared to the previous seasons’ 58 points (18 goals and 40 assists). Both are way off from his career-best in 2018-19 when he had 99 points (36 goals and 63). Forwards Sean Monahan and Matthew Tkachuk are in the same situation.Blake Coleman could be the boost Calgary needs, having signed a six-year $29.4 million contract this summer. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_6>Issues off the ice seem to be the Sharks' biggest problem this season. Evander Kane, the team’s leading goal scorer last season, was left off the team’s opening night roster. First accused of betting on NHL games, Kane is now reportedly being investigated by the league over allegations that he used a fake vaccine card. Tomas Hertl enters the season with the Sharks but it could be his last over unsettled contract negotiations that are complicated by San Jose’s cap situation.The good news is Logan Couture, Timo Meier and Erik Karlsson can easily pick up the slack, and making the playoffs could be motivation for Hertl to get the deal he’s eyeing. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News_7>Seems like an odd thing to say but the Ducks will have to score if they want to win. For a team that ranked last in goals per game, the Ducks have had a relatively quiet offseason. In fact, Anaheim’s top scorers were Max Comtois and Adam Henrique who scored a combined 28 goals.The Ducks are surely relying on their young forwards to boost production but finishing at the bottom of their division with a 17-30-9 record doesn’t seem promising.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/nhl-2021-22-pacific-kraken-inaugural-season", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20864_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "SAN JOSE, CA - OCTOBER 09: Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Robin Lehner (90) skates during a timeout during the San Jose Sharks game versus the Vegas Golden Knights on October 9, 2021, at SAP Center at San Jose in San Jose, CA.

{"title": "Wounded US Marine veteran recalls ‘powerful’ moment before Lightning’s Stanley Cup game", "body": "Retired Lieutenant Colonel Ty Edwards was given a grim prognosis of ever standing or walking again after he was severely wounded in combat in Afghanistan in 2008. But on Wednesday the 20-year  veteran did just that, as he was cheered on by a crowd of more than 17,000 fans at Tampa Bay’s Amalie Arena during the national anthem before Game 2 of the . Proudly donning his  jersey, 51-year-old Edwards stood as the U.S. Air Force 6th Air Mobility Wing Honor Guard presented the nation’s colors, telling Fox News in a phone interview that it was \"just phenomenal.\"\"The Lightning organization and [owner] Mr. [Jeffrey] Vinik, and the  overall, are such first-class organizations. It was great to be there with my entire family,\" Edwards said. Edwards first joined the military in 1992. He served as an infantry officer in the 1st Battalion 7th Marines. Edwards told Fox News that he went on three-unit deployments to Okinawa, Japan, and following the 9/11 attacks, he was deployed twice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan where he was wounded in combat. <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20977_News_0>Edwards was shot in the head during an ambush in Afghanistan's Kunar province on Oct. 18, 2008. His interpreter Hakimi Quadratullah, who was just 20-years-old at the time, was the first to reach him. He and other Marines withstood enemy fire as Edwards was treated in the field for his wounds.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20977_News_1>They were eventually taken to Bagram Airfield before being flown to Germany, where Edwards would meet his wife Anna and was later transported to Maryland's Bethesda Naval Hospital. \"Every day he goes through an hour of rehabilitation on his own to make himself better,\" Mark Van Trees, the director of Support the Troops, told Fox News of Edwards. \"They told him the prognosis to ever stand up or walk again was not very good… His spirit and his humbleness are just unmatched.\" The national anthem debate has taken center stage over the years but for Edwards, he says that while he might not agree, he doesn’t \"fault\" anyone for their decision not to take part. \"I just want to pay tribute to all those that have lost their lives and made sacrifices that the average American doesn’t see but I don’t fault anybody. It’s a free country.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20977_News_2>\"I don’t agree with it but it’s their choice,\" he added. Edwards called the pregame ceremonies on Wednesday a \"powerful\" moment, adding that he was just \"honored to be there.\" \"I wasn’t really thinking about anything but making it through the anthem at the time.\"Van Trees works with the Lightning organization to select guests to be honored during the national anthem, a program that began over eight years ago. Van Trees told Fox News that this program is one of many the Lightning run as a part of their long-standing relationship with the military community in Tampa Bay. \"It dates back to when Mr. Vinik bought the Lightning. He has a commitment to the veterans -- his father served -- and when he bought the Lightning, he quickly became aware that Tampa is the home of two combat commands (at MacDill Air Force Base) … and we have one of the highest concentrations of veterans.\" According to the , there are 1,525,400 veterans in the state of Florida as of 2017. The state has the third-largest veteran population in the nation, behind California and Texas.\"(Vinik’s) commitment to support the military is not something new. It’s something he’s been passionate about for years,\" Van Trees added.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_20977_News_3>The Lightning have two major events a year honoring servicemen and women, including Military Appreciation Night. Van Trees told Fox News that the Lightning also runs a program called Seats for Service, in which season ticket-holders who are not going to use their tickets can offer them up to military members. He said in the five years the program has been running, almost 18,000 tickets have been given to service members.The Lightning also launched the Community Hero Program in 2011, where a local hero is picked at every home game and a $50,000 donation is made to a nonprofit charity of their choice. During the finals, the donation was upped to $100,000.Edwards is a proud Lightning fan who recognizes the organization's continued support of the veteran community. And he has a bold prediction as Tampa heads into Game 3 of the series against the Montreal Canadiens on Friday night: \"They’ll win in four,\" he said.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/lightning-honor-ty-edwards-marines-anthem-stanley-cup", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20977_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Edwards' Embedded Training Team (ETT 7-3) during pre-deployment training for Afghanistan in the Fall of 2007 (Credit: Ty Edwards)", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_20977_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/07/thumbnail_ett-.jpg"}, {"caption": "Edwards (right) and Quadratullah, the interpreter who was the first one to reach him the day they were ambushed.

{"title": "NHL 2021 season preview: New divisions and old rivals", "body": "The NHL will kick off the start of 2021 season on Wednesday more than three months after successfully awarding the Stanley Cup to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the midst of a pandemic that saw 24 teams enter a playoff bubble that would last for nearly two months. The 2019-2020 regular season was first paused on March 12. For months, Commissioner Gary Bettman couldn't say for sure if the entire season would be scrapped or if there was a contingency plan in place that would allow the league to at least play for the cup.After months of uncertainty, hockey returned on Aug. 1 with a unique 24-team tournament format that would see 12 teams from each conference isolate in Edmonton and Toronto. There was still no guarantee if the league would be able to pull it off but on Sept. 28 the Lightning bested the Dallas Stars 2-0 in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals and the season that almost wasn’t, finally came to a close. Now, months after negotiating between the league and the players’ union and planning out the safest way for the season to be played, hockey makes its return but in a very different way. Playing in a bubble would prove too difficult at this stage. The season has been shortened from 82 games to 56. Teams will only play in their newly realigned divisions as a result of travel restrictions. The seven Canadian teams, the North Division, will play each opponent nine or 10 times while the three other divisions in the U.S. will play each divisional opponent eight times. The top four teams in each division will advance to the playoffs. The pressure is on under this new format but some teams will surely struggle after being off the ice for nearly 10 months. Here’s a brief look at each team going into the new season.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_21614_News_0>The North Division is arguably the most stacked division in the league with six of its seven members having made the playoffs last season. The Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers will hash it out in the Battle of Alberta 10 times this season while Toronto Maple Leafs star forward Auston Matthews looks to hoist the cup for a franchise that is one season away from tying the league’s longest drought without a cup. With so many star-studded names in the net, including Winnipeg Jets's Connor Hellebuyck and 2018 Stanley Cup winner Braden Holtby, the Canadian offenses will have their work cut out of them.2019-20 record: 36-27-7Divisional finish: 4th Pacific2019-20 record: 37-25-9Divisional finish: 2nd Pacific 2019-20 record: 31-31-9Divisional finish: 5th Atlantic 2019-20 record: 25-34-12Divisional finish: 7th Atlantic2019-20 record: 36-25-9Divisional finish: 3rd Atlantic2019-20 record: 36-27-6Divisional finish: 3rd Pacific 2019-20 record: 37-28-6Divisional finish: 5th Central**<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_21614_News_1>The West Division is made up of two extremes: two teams who have collectively won three Stanley Cups in the last 10 years and three teams who have never held the cup in league history. Despite being one of those teams to never have their name etched into the cup, the Vegas Golden Knights will present themselves as one of the biggest challenges, having made it to the cup finals in the first year as a franchise and most recently losing to the Stars in the Western Conference Finals. The St. Louis Blues will likely land one of the top four spots in the division while the Arizona Coyotes and Los Angeles Kings will have to avoid sinking to the bottom. 2019-20 record: 29-33-9 Divisional finish: 6th Pacific 2019-20 record: 33-29-8Divisional finish: 5th Pacific 2019-20 record: 42-20-8 Divisional finish: 2nd Central2019-20 record: 29-35-6 Divisional finish: 7th Pacific 2019-20 record: 35-27-7Divisional finish: 6th Central2019-20 record: 29-36-5 Divisional finish: 8th Pacific 2019-20 record: 42-19-10Divisional finish: 1st Central2019-20 record: 39-24-8Divisional finish: 1st Pacific <IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_21614_News_2>The Dallas Stars will have at least eight chances to hash it out with the Tampa Bay Lightning this season after the new realignment put the Stanley Cup Final teams in the same division for the regular season.

Anthony Beauvillier had an empty-netter with 6:18 left and New York bounced back after failing to close out the series in losing the previous two games in overtime.Greiss posted his first career playoff shutout in his first Game 7.

After allowing just nine goals through the first seven playoff games, they closed giving up 31 in their last nine.Philadelphia’s power-power play unit particularly fizzled in closing the playoffs going 0 for 17 over its final eight games, and converting just 4 of 52 chances.The Islanders became the third team of the second round of the playoffs to win Game 7 after squandering a 3-1 series lead.

Derick Brassard drove the right post, drawing the Flyers attention, and fed a pass through the middle to Greene in the left circle, from where he snapped the shot into open side. Hart wasn’t anticipating the pass, and was late in diving across.Nelson then made it 3-0 by converting Josh Bailey’s pass on a two-on-one break with 8:34 left in the second period.

{"title": "Hype or horror? The risk of CTE brain disease divides football and medical communities", "body": "Football. Drugs. Aggression. Murder. Jail. Suicide.How much of ex-NFL player Aaron Hernandez’s troubled life stemmed from the brain injury chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known simply as CTE?The question has been re-ignited on the heels of the hit Netflix documentary “Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,” with medical experts, players, parents and sporting bodies purporting to understand the still mysterious – and highly controversial – condition.How much of a cause for concern is it really?“CTE is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that shares characteristics with Alzheimer’s disease. The major differences between those two diseases is how they begin, the location of the initial brain lesions, and pattern of progression, and the clinical symptoms that result,” Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told Fox News. “CTE is very rare in the overall population, but it is clearly prevalent in populations with significant exposure to brain trauma.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22056_News_0>While often associated with football, CTE was first recognized in the 1920s as “punch drunk syndrome” in boxers. Since then, it has expanded to raise red flags around a myriad of other sports including soccer, rugby, horse racing, bull-riding, skiing/snowboarding, hockey, and wrestling.Medical researchers now believe CTE is caused by an accumulation of apparent tau proteins in the brain – which can impair neuro-pathways.“Cells start to die and the brain starts to shrink, causing memory problems and trouble living your daily life, and problems with behavior, specifically outbursts of violence,” explained Michael L. Alosco, Assistant Professor of Neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine, which has pioneered much of the CTE research over the past 12 years. “But we are trying to get a better sense of what this disease looks like in life.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22056_News_1>Yet it is a condition where there are seemingly more unknowns than there are knowns.As it stands, there is no accurate mechanism for detecting abnormal tau abrasions in a living person. It’s only after death, in an autopsy, that such an abnormality can be identified. Moreover, scientists are still in the process of determining what specific genetic markers make one person must prone to CTE than another person, irrespective of the number of knocks and head traumas. And many of the indicia can be attributed to other neurological diseases.FAMILY MURDER SUICIDES IN YEMEN HIGHLIGHT DEPTHS OF WAR-INDUCED MENTAL HEALTH CRISISThe biggest advancement, Alosco highlighted, that they are working toward is a “tau tracer” that could be effective on a live patient.“CTE has only recently been recognized.  Whenever a new disorder or pathology is identified or suggested, there is much research to understand the causative or contributing factors, pathological processes, clinical diagnosis, lab tests, and imaging,” observed Dr. Joseph Horrigan of the Southern California University of Health Sciences. “(But) the symptoms of those who develop what we label as CTE should be alarming.  We are seeing athletes with outstanding physical and mental capabilities become reduced to patients with cognitive deficits, memory loss, irritability and aggression, impulse control issues, mood changes and in some cases suicide.  These symptoms are occurring at a younger age than we would normally expect.”Alosco said that Hernandez, who was 27 when he died behind bars almost three years ago, had a “pretty advanced disease,” but the youngest case he can recall was that of a 24-year-old. Boston University currently has one of the largest brain banks in the world, its researchers have analyzed more than 650 brains of a wide age range in the endeavor to establish a CTE consensus.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22056_News_2>And there has been no shortage of lawsuits surrounding the alleged prevalence of CTE. In 2011, almost 5000 retired players collectively sued the NFL claiming long-term neurocognitive diseases that could be connected to CTE, ending in a $1 billion agreement for a longstanding compensation fund to aid former players and their families.In 2018, 53 former professional wrestlers accused World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) of masking the threat of head injuries. The suit was subsequently dismissed and is not on appeal. That same year, more than 300 players joined the multidistrict litigation against the National Hockey League (NHL) regarding neurological woes. And in August last year, an Illinois federal judge approved a $75 million settlement between the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and millions of student-athletes to monitor concussion symptoms.The likes of Paul Wood, 38, a former professional rugby league player in the U.K. is already prepared for his symptoms to start worsening.“I sustained substantial head impacts most games and during training on a regular basis which today I feel certainly contributes to my memory loss, mood swings and lack of concentration,” he noted, underscoring that such symptoms have become more pronounced since retiring in 2018. “I had numerous concussions but the nature of our environment meant I always wanted to keep training or playing, even with headaches.”Wood underscored that the subject of CTE is especially worrisome given that “rugby league is a high-impact sport,” and that he didn’t wear protection. However, experts say that headgear makes little difference when it comes to this particular purported disease.“I don’t think (headgear) is going to make all that much difference when it comes to CTE,” said Alosco. “Headgear is meant to stop skull fractures, not stop the brain from moving.”From Nowinski’s lens, “our society needs to have a serious discussion about preventing and learning how to treat CTE.”“Three million children currently play tackle football, and our research has shown that their odds of developing CTE increase by 30 percent each year they play,” he continued. “Those individuals began playing football as children, most of the exposure happened before the age of 18, meaning before the age of consent. We need to change how we play sports.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22056_News_3>Such changes, he pointed out, entail “in football, reducing contact in practice, in soccer limiting exposure to headers,” and in baseball introducing limits as to “how many times you can hit an athlete in the head.”But certainly, not everyone will develop protracted neurological issues either during their playing days or in the decades that come after. The lack of definitive answers – as of yet – has turned CTE into an especially decisive issue across the country.New Jersey native Anthony Patanella, 38, said he has suffered more concussions in his two-decade career as a professional boxer than he can count – and said more needs to be done from the top to minimize CTE risks.“They can stop fights sooner if the fighter is taking too many punches and not punching back or moving his head to avoid taking hits,” he said. “I’ve seen other fights with (evident) brain damage, slurring their words, and it is sad. (Too many blows) can affect you in the long haul, and then it is too late.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22056_News_4>Yet Merril Hoge, a former running back for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Bears later turned ESPN analyst, has been one of the most outspoken critics against the alarm surrounding CTE studies – putting much of the research down to “science fiction” and “misleading” science far from a factual realm. In 2018, he co-authored the controversial book “Brainwashed: The Bad Science Behind CTE and the Plot to Destroy Football” with Dr. Peters Cummings, an assistant neurobiology professor at BU, essentially rejected much of the “unfounded” hype.“It is easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled. Concussion and TBI (traumatic brain injury) are real, but there is no connection between this and CTE,” Hoge lamented, stressing that “CTE” has too often become something of an excuse for poor behavioral patterns in later life.He also underscored that, from his lens, demonizing sports like football does more harm to American children than good.“The leading cause of brain disease is obesity. We have kids rotting in front of our eyes from sugar and inactivity, and now we want to create a corrupt narrative for them not to play,” Hoge conjectured. “With all the head trauma protocol and treatments we have available today, we have the best environment for our kids to be playing in the history of sports.”XFL RULES TO IMPACT COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAM'S SPRING GAMEFor its part, the NFL has continued to back government-funded research on the issue as part of its “Play Smart. Play Safe” initiative and has allocated $40 million toward medical research primarily devoted to neuroscience.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22056_News_5>“Important research advancements have been made over the last several years around traumatic brain injury (TBIs). Close attention needs to be paid to these research findings and collectively the research community must work together,” Dr. Sills, the Chief Medical Officer of the NFL, told Fox News. “While we don’t have all the answers, the NFL has been a leader on player health and safety including implementing data-driven rules changes that aim to help eliminate potentially risky behavior that could lead to injuries, especially to the head and neck; and instituting a concussion protocol reflecting the most up-to-date medical consensus on the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of concussions.”Sills stressed that the NFL is furthermore providing sideline medical support that includes unaffiliated medical personnel and new technology to assist in the identification and review of injuries, with a specific focus on concussions; mandating ongoing health and safety education for players and training for club and non-affiliated medical personnel; developing mandatory guidelines on protective equipment; enforcing limits on contact practice; and advancing developments in engineering, biomechanics, advanced sensors, and materials science that mitigate forces and better protect against injuries in contact sports and recreational sports.So where to go from here?Anthony Trucks, a former player for the Washington Redskins and Pittsburgh Steelers who retiring just over a decade ago said that while he does have some concerns, he thinks the alarm has largely been “blown out of proportion.”“If you were ever going to play, now is the safest time,” he said. “And there are many benefits to the game. I want my kids to go to practice, and competition is great for humanity.”GET THE FOX NEWS APPIndeed, for many professionals, the benefits of the game far outweigh the cons.“Would I play again for 17 years? Even though I know it has had an impact on my brain?” Wood added. “The answer is yes. I would do it all over again.”", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//health/hype-or-horror-the-risk-of-cte-brain-disease-divides-football-and-medical-communities", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22056_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Dec. 10, 2012: New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez reacts during the second quarter of an NFL football game against the Houston Texans in Foxborough, Mass.

{"title": "Former NHL player causes emergency landing for reportedly assaulting flight attendant who denied him drink", "body": "A former National Hockey League player recently forced a domestic Russian flight to make an emergency landing after the 37-year-old athlete allegedly hit a flight attendant on the head for being denied alcohol.On New Year's Day, Oleg Saprykin had reportedly been intoxicated when he boarded an Aurora Airlines flight from Sochi to Moscow, the International Business Times (IBT) reports. According to the outlet, Saprykin demanded that a female flight attendant top-up his glass with whiskey midflight – which she refused – before things took a turn for the worse.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22405_News_0>“During the flight from Sochi to Moscow on the morning of Jan. 1, one of the business class passengers miscalled whiskey without calculating the capabilities of the body. The man began to scream and use foul language,” an aviation insider told the Russian outlet Interfax, as per IBT.Attempting to calm the passenger, believed to be Saprykin, IBT reported he “hit her on the head with such a force that she fell to the floor,” causing bruises.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22405_News_1>\"The commander decided to interrupt the flight and land at the nearest airport urgently,” the source continued, and the plane soon touched down at Voronezh International Airport.Upon deplaning, Saprykin was arrested and detained by law enforcement officials, while the aircraft continued on to Moscow, IBT reports.Two videos said to be related to the incident soon surfaced on the Internet, released by the Russian Interior Ministry, as per the Mirror. In the first clip, the hockey pro apparently feuds with cabin crew members on the plane; in the second, Saprykin appears to explode in rage as he is detained in a jail cell, wearing only underwear.According to the Mirror, Saprykin was ultimately served a fine and released. Meanwhile, TravelPulse reports that the flight attendant he attacked declined to press charges.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22405_News_2>He proceeded to fly to Moscow with his wife and kids on another flight, the Mirror reports.The hockey pro later offered a different take on the purported events to Russian outlet Sport Express, as per RT.“I’ll say right away, there was no fight, I didn’t touch anyone, neither fellow passengers nor a stewardess,” Saprykin said in a recent interview. “I was drinking calmly, sitting with my wife in business class. Then suddenly we landed unexpectedly in Voronezh.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22405_News_3>“The service was OK. They brought everything on time,” he continued. “I didn’t attack anyone. If that had happened, I would be sitting at home now.”The athlete said he was only given an “administrative fine” for foul language. Saprykin continued to claim that the pilot landed the flight early of his own accord.Representatives for Aurora Airlines did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.Saprykin, a left-handed left winger, continues to play pro hockey in Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League, as per Heavy.

{"title": "Cheerleaders for NFL, NBA, NHL teams reveal sexual harassment, 'handsy' fans come with the job", "body": "Dozens of cheerleaders for NBA, NHL and NFL teams say experiencing endless sexual harassment and unwanted touching by \"handsy\" fans are a typical part of the job -- with one former NFL cheerer going so far as to compare the gig to being an escort.The numerous professional cheerleaders interviewed by The New York Times all described the job in a similar fashion: eye candy.“When you have on a push-up bra and a fringed skirt, it can sometimes, unfortunately, feel like it comes with the territory,” Labriah Lee Holt, a former cheerleader for the Tennessee Titans, told The New York Times. “I never experienced anything where someone on the professional staff or the team said something or made me feel that way. But you definitely experience that when you encounter people who have been drinking beer.”The cheerleaders said team officials were aware of the unwanted remarks and touching but did little to prevent it. Holt recalled that during times cheerleaders were sent to engage with tailgating fans, the women traveled in groups for safety.“There wasn’t any protection from it,” she said. “You have to run around the tailgates, go to the tents, mingle with fans and shake the pompoms. And you sometimes get the disgusting old men who have been drinking and will say something inappropriate. It is common, and the industry knows that.”A former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, who asked not to be identified because she signed a non-disclosure agreement, told The Times about one instance when a Philadelphia Eagles fan told her he hoped she was raped.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_0>“We were walking by, waving and smiling, and one guy caught my eye,” the cheerleader said. “He looked at me and said, ‘I hope you get raped!’ That’s the kind of stuff we’d have yelled at us. Even from our fans, once they get drunk, they yell things, and you’re like, ‘Really?’ It’s part of the job. It comes with it. You’re supposed to take it.”The former Cowboys cheerleader said she was told by the team not to retaliate if a fan said something inappropriate or touched them without consent.“We were taught, if someone’s getting handsy on you, how to navigate that,” the former cheerleader said. “We were told what to say, like, ‘That’s not very nice,’ To be sweet, not rude. Say, ‘Can I ask you to step over here?’ Use body language to help deter the situation. Never be mean. Never. Always courteous. Because if it’s not for the fans, we wouldn’t be here — that’s how we were supposed to think of this.”Several cheerleaders told The Times that, besides showing up to games, they also were required to make appearances at tailgate parties, luxury suites and specific bars.“You knew the alcohol was flowing and that they would be handsy,” the former Cowboys cheerleader said. “Arms around the waist, kisses on the cheek. You knew they would, and you couldn’t say anything.”She said if they objected than they were dropped from the team.The Dallas Cowboys declined to comment on the allegations.A former Washington Redskins cheerleader said she along with five other teammates were once told to go to a house where seven middle-aged men were watching NFL games. The woman said the men sized them up and asked if they were single or married. The men offered the women drinks but they declined. During the strange meeting, she recalled dancing for the men and walking around the home talking to the guys.“It was sketchy because we were in some dude’s house, some random house, and it was physically uncomfortable to be there,” the cheerleader said.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_1>The woman said she felt it was unfair teams were making money off their appearances yet the cheerleaders were paid barely above minimum wage. She said the team was paid $1,200 a cheerleader while she received only $100 to show up.“It’s literally like you’re calling for an escort,” she said.“It’s not like somebody grabbed my boobs, and nobody told me, ‘Have sex with me right now.’ It’s a lot more nuanced,” the former cheerleader said. “It’s like every other abuse dynamic. You don’t feel like you have the liberty to say, 'I’d prefer not to do this.' In turn, you’re treated poorly and are paid hardly anything and are ragged on in rehearsal for not wearing the right lipstick. The whole thing is so messed up.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_2>The Redskins told The New York Times in a statement: “The safety and security of all of our employees, including our cheerleaders, is now and has always been a top priority for our organization. We are unaware of any reports of any promotional appearances that made Redskins cheerleaders uncomfortable. We take such reports very seriously and will continue to take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and security of our cheerleaders.”Bailey Davis, a former cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints who said she was fired days after posting a picture on social media of herself in a one-piece bathing suit in January said she was told to deal with drunk fans even if they touched her without her consent.“They tell us that we’re celebrities and to present ourselves well, but then they throw us out there with these drunk fans,” she said. “You have to take pictures with anyone who asks. You can’t refuse a picture with anyone. If there’s a sloppy drunk who you know just wants to put his hands on you, you just have to deal with it and do it.”<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_3>Davis said she got used to the nasty remarks and touching. Following her termination, Davis filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming the Saints hold cheerleaders and players to separate standards.The Saints responded to Davis’ claims saying the organization “does not tolerate harassment at any kind.”“At no time during the 8 months that Ms. Davis worked for the Saints did she ever report that she believed she had been harassed by anyone,” the team said.A few Cleveland Cavaliers cheerleaders said they were also subjected to groping and lewd comments.<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_4>“I remember getting my butt grabbed by a 12-year-old who should’ve been kicked out of the game,” a Cavaliers cheerleader who asked to remain anonymous said. “For whatever reason, fans think they own you.”“I was 19 and was just a baby,” she continued. “If I had more world experience, there’s no way I would’ve put up with all that. Now that I’m working in a professional environment, I realize that the way we were treated there was absolutely illegal.”The Cavaliers said in a statement that they took the allegations seriously.“All of our game entertainment team members should be able to perform and engage with our fans without enduring harassment of any kind or inappropriate interaction or contact,\" the team said.Lacy Thibodeaux, a former Oakland Raiders cheerleader, said she was advised about holding her pompoms in a position to prevent fans from touching her butt or waist during photo ops.“If someone got too handsy, we could just turn around and leave,” Thibodeaux said. “But we still had to be gracious and say, ‘Thank you very much.’”<IMG Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_5>", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/cheerleaders-for-nfl-nba-nhl-teams-reveal-sexual-harassment-handsy-fans-come-with-the-job", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "An expose found cheerleaders in numerous pro sports were subjected to taunts, threats and uncomfortable situations.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/dallas-cowboys-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Numerous cheerleaders say they had to make appearances in luxury suites and bars and at tailgate parties.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/redskins.jpg"}, {"caption": "A former Washington Redskins cheerleader said it was unfair the team was getting paid for their appearances.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/redskins-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "The Saints said the organization does \"not tolerate harassment of any kind.\"", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/saints.jpg"}, {"caption": "The New Orleans Saints said the organization did not receive an alleged complaint from a former cheerleader regarding sexual harassment.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/saints-2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Several NFL teams reportedly enforce strict rules regarding a cheerleader's weight and public dress.", "id": "Fox_Sports_NHL_22463_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/raiders.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Women's pro soccer league had systemic abuse and sexual misconduct, investigation reveals", "body": "An independent investigation into the scandals that erupted in the National Women's Soccer League last season found emotional abuse and sexual misconduct were systemic in the sport, impacting multiple teams, coaches and players, according to a report released Monday.\"Abuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women’s soccer, beginning in youth leagues, that normalizes verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players,\" former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Q. Yates wrote in her report on the investigation.U.S. Soccer commissioned the investigation by Yates and the law firm King & Spaulding after former NWSL players Sinead Farrelly and Mana Shim came forward with allegations of harassment and sexual coercion dating back a decade involving former coach Paul Riley. Their account was published by The Athletic in September 2021.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_0>Riley, who denied the allegations, was quickly fired as head coach of the North Carolina Courage, and NWSL Commissioner Lisa Baird stepped down.But it was clear the problems were widespread. Five of the 10 head coaches in the NWSL last season either were fired or stepped down amid allegations of misconduct.\"The verbal and emotional abuse players describe in the NWSL is not merely ‘tough’ coaching. And the players affected are not shrinking violets. They are among the best athletes in the world,\" Yates wrote.More than 200 people were interviewed by investigators. Some two dozen entities and individuals provided documents. U.S. Soccer also provided documents and the firm reviewed 89,000 deemed likely to be relevant.U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone called the findings \"heartbreaking and deeply troubling.\" The report recounts an episode in 2013, when Parlow Cone was coach of the Portland Thorns, in which she herself experienced an inappropriate comment by a team executive.\"I’ve been a part of this game all my life, from the youth all the way up to the professional level and an international level, so the women’s game is really important to me. And many of the players in this report I know. Many of them I coached,\" Parlow Cone said. \"I just found it really maddening that players had to go through this.\"The report made numerous recommendations to prioritize player health and safety. Among them is the requirement that teams accurately disclose coach misconduct to the league and the soccer federation to ensure coaches aren’t allowed to move between teams. It also calls for meaningful vetting of coaches and timely investigation into allegations of abuse.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_1>The NWSL said it was reviewing the report. The league and the NWSL Players Association are also conducting an investigation.\"We recognize the anxiety and mental strain that these pending investigations have caused and the trauma that many – including players and staff – are having to relive. We continue to admire their courage in coming forward to share their stories and influence all the changes necessary to keep moving our league forward,\" NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman said in a statement. \"Establishing trust and confidence between the league, its players and other key stakeholders remains a central focus for the NWSL, and we know that we must learn from and take responsibility for the painful lessons of the past in order to move the league into a better future.\"Parlow Cone would not speculate on possible discipline for teams across the league.\"This is really systemic, and so the league is going to do what they need to do. U.S. Soccer, we’re going to do what we need to do. But more broadly, we need to make sure that no team, no organization, no individual, no executive is ever allowed to put the players in the position that they were put in,\" Parlow Cone said.The investigation focused on three former coaches: Riley, Christy Holly of Racing Louisville and Rory Dames of the Chicago Red Stars. The Associated Press reached out to the Thorns, Racing Louisville and the Red Stars for comment but did not receive immediate responses.The report recounts an April 2021 encounter between Holly and a player, Erin Simon, who now plays in Europe. Holly invited her to watch game film with him and allegedly told her that for every pass she messed up, he was going to touch her. Simon told investigators Holly \"pushed his hands down her pants and up her shirt.\"Simon, now with Leicester City, said too many athletes suffer in silence because they are afraid they won't be heard.\"I know because that is how I felt,\" the 28-year-old said in a statement. \"Through many difficult days, my faith alone sustained me and kept me going. I want to do everything in my power to ensure that no other player must experience what I did. This report allows our voices to finally be heard and is the first step toward achieving the respectful workplace we all deserve.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_2>Holly was terminated for cause but Racing Louisville declined to publicly state the reason. Yates' report noted that Racing did not provide investigators with details about Holly's employment, citing mutual nondisclosure and non-disparagement clauses.Farrelly said the harassment she experienced began in 2011 when she was a player with the Philadelphia Independence of the Women’s Professional Soccer league. Riley was her coach.She told The Athletic the abuse by Riley continued when she was with the Portland Thorns in 2014 and 2015. Shim, a former Thorns player, also said she experienced harassment. Neither is playing in the NWSL now.The Thorns said they investigated Riley in 2015 while he was with the team and reported the findings to the league. They did not renew his contract but did not make the reasons public.The report said the Thorns were not forthcoming with certain information and they attempted to prevent investigators from using the team's 2015 report.\"The Portland Thorns interfered with our access to relevant witnesses and raised specious legal arguments in an attempt to impede our use of relevant documents,\" Yates wrote.Riley went on to coach the Western New York Flash, which later moved to North Carolina and was renamed.When the scandal broke last year, former Thorns forward Alex Morgan posted to social media: \"The league was informed of these allegations multiple times and refused multiple times to investigate the allegations. The league must accept responsibility for a process that failed to protect its own players from this abuse.\"Morgan also said Shim and Farrelly asked the NWSL earlier last year for a new investigation into Riley's behavior but were rebuffed.The U.S. Women's National Team Players Association released a statement saying: \"All Players and employees deserve to work in an environment free of discrimination, harassment, and abusive conduct. The USWNTPA commends the courage of the survivors, current Players, and former Players who came forward to speak out against abusive practices that have become far too normalized in the NSWL and women’s soccer generally. At the same time, USWNTPA is dismayed that some NWSL clubs and USSF staff impeded the investigation; those who have not done so should fully cooperate with the ongoing NWSL/NWSLPA investigation immediately.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_3>U.S. Soccer said its board of directors and a leadership team would begin implementing the report's recommendations immediately.\"U.S. Soccer and the entire soccer community have to do better, and I have faith that we can use this report and its recommendations as a critical turning point for every organization tasked with ensuring player safety,\" Parlow Cone said. \"We have significant work to do, and we’re committed to doing that work and leading change across the entire soccer community.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/womens-pro-soccer-league-systemic-abuse-exual-misconduct-investigation-reveals", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Cindy Parlow Cone, President of the United States Soccer Federation, makes a few remarks before the historic signing of the collective bargaining agreement signifying equal pay between the men's and women's national soccer teams at Audi Field on September 06, 2022 in Washington, DC.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/cindy-parlow.jpg"}, {"caption": "US Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone and Becky Sauerbrunn, Crystal Dunn, and Sam Mewis of the United States sign the Collective Bargaining Agreement after a game between Nigeria and USWNT at Audi Field on September 6, 2022 in Washington, DC.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/womens-soccer-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "United States Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh talks with US Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone and United States Senator from Washington Maria Cantwell after a game between Nigeria and USWNT at Audi Field on September 6, 2022 in Washington, DC.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/cindy-parlow-cone-1.jpg"}, {"caption": "US Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone, Becky Sauerbrunn and Alex Morgan of the USWNT celebrate following the signing of the Collective Bargaining Agreement after a game between Nigeria and USWNT at Audi Field on September 6, 2022 in Washington, DC.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25116_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/womens-soocer.jpg"}]}
{"title": "A leftist victory in Brazil's election could be the lifeline Cuba, Venezuela need right now", "body": "SAO PAULO, Brazil - While Brazil’s perennial leftist leader Lula da Silva may enjoy the support of the majority of Brazil’s artistic community, incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro scored a major coup this week, receiving a public endorsement from the nation’s biggest soccer star, Neymar. In a video posted to Twitter, the goal-scoring legend danced and sang along to a Bolsonaro campaign jingle, proclaiming, \"Vote, vote, and confirm, 22 is Bolsonaro.\" The right-wing candidate whose electoral number for voting is 22, subsequently returned the favor with a visit to the Neymar Foundation in Praia Grande, Sao Paulo. Yet, even the backing of the great Neymar may not be enough to save Bolsonaro’s lagging campaign.A tense nation gathered around their television screens on Thursday night to watch the final presidential debate, on television channel Globo, which hosts many of Brazil’s most popular telenovelas.  Indeed, the debate commenced at the odd time slot of 10:30 pm and stretched until 2 in the morning, directly following Pantanal, a Brazilian soap opera.The debate featured a unique and engaging format somewhat resembling a game show, in which various permutations of candidates and questions were drawn from glass bowls, and two candidates at a time confronted each other face-to-face in three-minute increments. <IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25123_News_0>Some of the tensest moments occurred when one of the seven presidential candidates, Soraya Thronicke, asked Bolsonaro point-blank whether he had plans to stage a coup in the event of an electoral loss.Bolsonaro dodged the question, saying, \"Well, that’s not the point,\" before moving on to allege that former ally Thronicke owed her Senate seat to his coattails.The issue of Bolsonaro’s potential refusal to accept the election results is the elephant in the room. He has given conflicting statements on the topic, but in widely reported remarks in mid-September, he did appear to acknowledge the possibility of losing his re-election bid, which appears increasingly likely if the polls are to be believed.\"If it's God's will, I'll continue ... if not, I'll pass the (presidential) sash and retire,\" Bolsonaro stated in a Christian podcast. \"At my age, I have nothing left to do here on Earth if my journey in politics ends on December 31.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25123_News_1>It is a departure from more aggressive statements he made in late August, when he famously declared, \"I have three alternatives for my future: being arrested, killed or victory.\"While it is likely that a Bolsonaro loss will be greeted by street protests and accusations of electoral fraud by some of the ex-army captain’s raucous supporters, it appears very unlikely that Brazil’s military forces would intervene in some kind of coup attempt to keep Bolsonaro in power.Nycollas Liberato, president of Brazil Students for Liberty and himself a former cadet at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy (the Brazilian equivalent of West Point), echoes that view, noting, \"Both of their groups of supporters (Bolsonaro and Lula) have an extremely aggressive and intolerant policy towards those who disagree with them … nevertheless, I do not believe Brazil is at risk of a post-election democratic rupture. The armed forces … are behaving in an exemplary manner and are not getting involved in dubious political statements.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25123_News_2>Both camps view the other candidate as a serious threat.Brazilians generally concede that Lula is corrupt, but they excuse it by arguing that all politicians are corrupt in the country; they view Lula as something of a jolly Robin Hood figure, redistributing resources to the poor.Political analyst Flavio Morgenstern argues, \"Lula has a very strong ideological appeal in a country contaminated by socialist ideas,\" and adds, \"he is the only character with charisma on the left, due to his already mythical past.\"That past troubles some. Political analyst Cristian Derosa argues: \"If Lula is elected, the result will be the return of the strengthening of the Sao Paulo Forum bloc, an entity created by Lula and Fidel Castro to maintain the power of the left in Latin America.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25123_News_3>\"In this project … Brazil has the role of main financier. During their administrations, Lula and [ex-president] Dilma carried out many projects in Venezuela and Cuba, such as ports and hydroelectric plants.\"Yet, Lula will likely not seek major changes that would jeopardize current U.S.-Brazil relations.Derosa argues, \"the political forces represented by Lula are anti-American by definition,\" yet he notes that, \"Lula is skilled in negotiations and has always maintained a posture of dialoguing with everyone. He wouldn't make a trade break, but he will certainly prefer multilateral relations … he would hardly break with the U.S., even more so while the United States is governed by the Democratic Party.\"Morgenstern adds that, \"with Biden, Lula would have an ally with some tension … his interest (in the U.S.) has always been purely economic,\" but \"Lula’s friends are enemies of even the American left … the communist dictatorships of Latin America, China, Russia, the Palestinian Authority.\"As to why Lula’s close association with dictatorships has never been wielded against him in Brazil, Morgenstern sees a significant difference between parties in Brazil and elsewhere: \"The Brazilian ideological left really believes that ‘social inequality’ is the biggest problem in the universe, so it is a declared fan of dictatorships (Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua), unlike the American left.\"Brazilians head to the polls on October 2 and will have a second round on October 30 if no candidate wins 50%.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//world/a-leftist-victory-brazils-election-could-be-the-lifeline-cuba-venezuela-need-right-now", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25123_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "President Jair Bolsonaro speaks during a press conference on International Day Against Corruption at the Planalto Palace on December 9, 2021, in Brasilia, Brazil.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25123_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/brazilpresident.jpg"}, {"caption": "President Jair Bolsonaro on stage at his final campaign rally in Sao Paulo.

{"title": "What is Cristiano Ronaldo's net worth? A look at the Portuguese football star's career", "body": "Cristiano Ronaldo is an award-winning professional footballer who plays as a forward for Manchester United in the Premier League. He is widely considered one of the best players in the world due to his multiple awards and championships, including his five Ballon d'Or awards, four European Golden Shoes, and over 32 trophies throughout his career. Moreover, the Portuguese football star has scored over 800 goals and has made over a thousand career appearances. Ronaldo started with Manchester United in 2003 at the age of 18, where he would go on to win FIFA Club World Cup a few years later and three consecutive Premier Leagues titles before leaving for Real Madrid in 2009. From 2009 until 2018, Ronaldo won 15 trophies with Real Madrid and earned a transfer offer to the team for 80 million Euros.For a brief period, Ronaldo signed with Juventus at the age of 30 before returning to Manchester United in 2021. In Portugal, he began leading the nation's team in 2008 and brought them to victory at the Euro 2016 tournament. Ronaldo is one of the leading earners in the sports world and is widely considered one of the greatest players of his generation. However, despite his widespread career success, reports have circulated that Ronald is not satisfied with his current deal at United and is looking to transfer to another team once again. <IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25163_News_0><IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25163_News_1><IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25163_News_2><IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25163_News_3>Ronaldo's tenure at Manchester United may be coming to an end as the Portuguese international looks to leave the organization to join Champions League football, according to Sky Sports. Recently, United had to deny rumors and speculation that Ronaldo's contract may be terminated early in order to free him up. However, a Manchester United spokesperson told Sky Sport that Ronaldo's contract would remain in place and there would be \"no change in the club's position.\"Ronaldo only has 12 months left on his current contract with Manchester with an option to continue playing for one additional year. The speculation over the 37-year-olds future with his current team came after Manchester's shocking 4-0 defeat at Brentford, where Ronaldo stormed off the stadium after the game, appearing frustrated. Ronaldo's reputation and stardom have helped him amass a large fortune over the course of his career, with estimated career earnings that exceed $1 billion and a salary of $115 million, according to Forbes. In 2016 and 2017, Forbes ranked Ronaldo as the world's highest-paid athlete, while his current salary has him ranked third. <IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25163_News_4>The football star has six children. He is currently dating Georgina Rodriguez, and the couple recently announced the death of their baby son. The couple was expecting twins – a boy and a girl. They also share another child Alana Martina. \"Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness,\" Ronaldo wrote on social media. \"We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss, and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time.\"Ronaldo is the father of twins Eva and Mateo, whom he had with a surrogate in 2017.

{"title": "Alexi Lalas breaks down US men's soccer team's World Cup chances: 'They got a chip on their shoulder'", "body": "The United States men’s national soccer team is back in the World Cup for the first time since 2014.The Americans are set to bring a group of young, upstart talent to Qatar in hopes they make some sort of impact to show just how far U.S. men’s soccer has come in the last eight years. Players like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Brenden Aaronson and Matt Turner are among those who highlight the current squad. By the time the World Cup starts in November, only two players will be over 30 years old.Alexi Lalas was on the squad when the team got to the Round of 16 in 1994. It was the first time the Americans had gotten that far since 1934 in Italy. Lalas is set to be one of the analysts covering the World Cup later this month for FOX Sports.Lalas told Fox News Digital that the first step for the U.S. team is to get out of the group stage before thinking anything about the knockout stage. The U.S. will have to contend with England, Wales and Iran in Group B.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_0>\"You gotta get out of the group and this is by no means an easy group with Wales, Iran and England. But this is a group that you should expect your team, even in 2022, even with this young, inexperienced team, to get out of the group. Then, anything can happen. You’ve got to get out of the group,\" Lalas said.\"That first game against Wales I think is huge. Obviously, the second game against England is going to be big from a competitive standpoint. But also, it’s U.S.-England on Black Friday. Everybody is going to be home, potentially the largest viewing audience from a television perspective in history for a soccer game when it comes to men. I’m a little excited about a lot of these things. I think that it’s worth your time and I think this team is worth your belief. After you get out of the group, then anything can happen.\"Lalas said that while the team is very young, they have a lot of \"swagger,\" which may carry the group into the knockout round\"This is a very young team, but they got swagger. They got a chip on their shoulder. I think they feel a responsibility to kind of set things right after the team didn’t make the World Cup four years ago,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"We got guys playing all over the world in some great leagues and teams. Christian Pulisic at Chelsea, Weston McKennie over at Juventus, Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams just going over to Leeds, who by the way is coached by American Jesse Marsch, Matt Turner, who was just playing for the New England Revolution, now has gone over to Arsenal. The list goes on and on.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_1>While their youth may help them at some points, Lalas said their inexperience on the big stage could end up being a weakness. Wales hasn’t qualified for the World Cup since 1958, but a world-class player like Gareth Bale on their roster makes up for the inexperience. England was runner-up in the Euro last year and have recently been shaky in the Nations League. Iran got huge wins earlier in the year over Lebanon, UAE and Iraq to propel them into the World Cup. Iran has made the last two World Cups, but failed to get out of the group stage.\"I guess a weakness would be the inexperience,\" Lalas said of the Americans. \"You’re going to have a lot of players, most of them, that are playing in their very first World Cup. There’s a chance that every singe player when we step on the field against Wales in that first game there’s going to be a player that’s never been to a World Cup. So, yes, there is some inexperience.\"There’s also the arrogance of youth, which at times can be a positive and at times it can be negative. I guarantee you, at some point, they’re going to do something stupid. That’s what we do when we’re young, right? You just hope that it’s not too much. But also there are going to be moments where they’re not going to give a crap about what people say or what’s written or how much money people make or what kind or how famous they are on the other side. They’re gonna go and say, ‘This is my time and I’m going to take it.’ And I love that about this team. and I think it starts at the top with Gregg Berhalter, who I think has used this last four years to really do something different. And a lot of young players like we talked about here but also foster a mentality that anything is possible.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_2>Lalas said it’s \"crucial\" for the U.S. to get off to a good start – and it begins with Bale and Wales.\"If you don’t get that win in that first game, or you lose – knock on wood you don’t – that second game against England, which we know is against a very, very good England, it becomes that much more important,\" he added.Lalas said there were a handful of Americans fans should pay attention to come November and December.\"We have the usual suspects to a certain extent because it’s still a young team like the Christian Pulisics. I do think a guy like Brenden Aaronson is going to really excite people with his work ethic and the guy will run through a wall, not in a moronic sense, but he’s just got a wonderful heart and grit that I think a lot of people will gravitate to. A guy like Yunus Moussa, a very young player playing in the midfield. That’s going to be something that’s going to be really interesting. You got a guy like Sergiño Dest over there on that right hand side who plays at Barcelona,\" he said.\"So again, all of these big clubs where these players play, and this is a whole generation now that’s kind of been groomed from a very early age to be soccer players – and whether that’s good or bad that’s for another time to discuss – but ultimately it has produced a generation that, first off, recognizes and feels they belong there, but also I think is equipped with the tools to deal with the pressure on and off the field. And ultimately, as I said, (has) accepted the responsibility to do big things. And for a lot of them, they will have grown up watching World Cups. And so this will be a moment, a moment just to say, ‘Ah, I’m here, I made it.’ Now, do what you’ve been doing since you were a kid and go out there and do some great things for the country.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_3>As for who wins, that’s a different story. France is coming in as the defending champions, having knocked off Croatia in the 2018 World Cup.\"That’s some good money right there because back when they won the World Cup four years ago, they were still very young and they’ve only gotten better,\" Lalas said. \"Problem is it’s very difficult to repeat when it comes to winning a World Cup. And it’s done very rarely in men’s or women’s, although from a U.S. perspective, going to our third when it comes to the women right now, it’s very, very difficult. People suss you out very quickly. But it wouldn’t surprise me in the very least you know with the (Kylian) Mbappes and Karim Benzema, who is just on fire, is probably the best goal scorer in the world right now in terms of form. There’s a lot to be excited about when it comes to France and it wouldn’t surprise me if they go on another run.\"The 2022 FIFA World Cup begins Nov. 20 and runs through Dec. 18.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/alexi-lalas-breaks-down-us-mens-soccer-teams-world-cup-chances-they-got-chip-their-shoulder", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Alexi Lalas of United States looks on during the FIFA World Cup 1994.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Alexi-Lalas2.jpg"}, {"caption": "Christian Pulisic with the ball during a game against Uruguay at Children's Mercy Park on June 5, 2022, in Kansas City, Kansas.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Christian-Pulisic.jpg"}, {"caption": "Weston McKennie stands for the national anthem before a match against Grenada at Q2 Stadium on June 10, 2022, in Austin, Texas.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Weston-McKennie.jpg"}, {"caption": "Fox Sports broadcaster Alexi Lalas works on the field before the match between the Nashville SC and the Atlanta United at Nissan Stadium on Feb. 29, 2020, in Nashville, Tennessee.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25167_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Alexi-Lalas.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Brighton hands Manchester United, new manager Erik ten Hag first loss", "body": "New manager, same old problems for Manchester United.United slumped to a 2-1 loss against Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday in Erik ten Hag’s first Premier League game in charge, dispelling any notion that the Dutch coach could provide an instant fix to the many issues that plagued the team last season.United looked vulnerable in defense — with Pascal Gross scoring twice in the first half to put Brighton in control — and toothless in attack until Cristiano Ronaldo came on early in the second half.\"Definitely a setback, a real disappointment,\" Ten Hag said. \"I knew from the start it will not be easy. And it’s a process, it takes time. But you don’t have time, we have to win games. We should have done better.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25171_News_0>And the questions about Ronaldo's future at the club remain.Ten Hag decided to leave Ronaldo out of his starting lineup after the Portugal star only played 45 minutes in preseason amid reports he wants to leave for a Champions League club.But it’s clear why Ten Hag wants to keep the 37-year-old forward as United looked much more dangerous with him on the field, although the hosts needed a goalkeeping error to pull a goal back.Robert Sanchez failed to punch away a corner and then got in the way of Alexis Mac Allister, who tried to clear the ball only to send it into his own net in the 68th.United continued to push forward but never came close to an equalizer as Brighton held on for a first win at Old Trafford in the club's history.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25171_News_1>\"It was obviously disappointing and the worst possible start at halftime to be 2-0 down at Old Trafford,\" United defender Harry Maguire said. \"Not good enough. We huffed and puffed and we got one back and we had chances to equalize, but it’s a bad start for us.\"While United improved in the second half, the first 45 minutes showed just how big a task Ten Hag is facing to turn around a club that finished sixth in the Premier League last season.While the hosts dominated possession, the only good chance they created came in the sixth minute when a cross was deflected into the path of Bruno Fernandes, who sent his shot well high of the bar.Brighton took the lead in the 30th when Danny Welbeck made a run into the area to collect a pass from Leandro Trossard near the byline and then squared the ball across goal for Gross to tap into an empty net.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25171_News_2>The second goal came after a quick counterattack, with Gross on hand to tap in the rebound after Solly March cut inside and saw his shot parried by David de Gea.\"I thought we had an idea of how to attack and when we could we tried to press and put them under pressure,\" Brighton manager Graham Potter said. \"We were positive, brave and the boys gave everything. Our performance in the first half was really strong.\"Ronaldo instantly gave United a jolt when he came on in the 52nd and set up Marcus Rashford for a one-on-one against Sanchez in the 60th but the goalkeeper blocked the forward’s shot. The offside flag was up against Ronaldo, but replays hinted he had stayed onside.That was the closest Ronaldo came to making an impact, though, and Ten Hag said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner remains short of match fitness after missing most of the team's preseason preparations.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25171_News_3>\"He has to do more to get fit. This game will help him,\" Ten Hag said. \"He will be better next week.\"Ten Hag, and United, better hope so.United’s players were booed off at halftime and at the final whistle, with Ten Hag looking grim-faced as he walked off the field.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/brighton-hands-manchester-united-new-manager-erik-ten-hag-first-loss", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25171_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Brighton's Pascal Gross, second from right, celebrates with his teammate Alexis Mac Allister after scoring his side's opening goal during the English Premier League soccer match between Manchester United and Brighton at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester, England, Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25171_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Brighton-2-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Manchester United's head coach Erik ten Hag stands during the English Premier League soccer match between Manchester United and Brighton at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester, England, Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25171_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Erik-ten-Hag-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo walks on the field at the end of the English Premier League soccer match between Manchester United and Brighton at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester, England, Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022.

{"title": "AC Milan team to beat in Serie A, rivals gear up to try and knock off defending champs", "body": "AC Milan started pre-season the same way it ended its title-winning campaign, with two goals from veteran forward Olivier Giroud.The goals in the 2-1 victory at Cologne in a friendly counted for a lot less than the double against Sassuolo that clinched Milan the Serie A title 55 days earlier, but it was a good sign for Giroud and his teammates.Title rivals Juventus and Inter Milan managed to get Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku back, respectively, making Milan's challenge of retaining the title all the harder.A successful run would be Milan's 20th Serie A title, earning it another star on its shirt because Italian teams are given a star for each 10 league titles.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_0>It would also see the team surpass local rival Inter, which has won the title 19 times.

And that has whet their appetite for more, with many cutting their vacation short and returning to pre-season training earlier than scheduled.That appears to have worked with some impressive results in friendlies, including a 5-0 drubbing of Wolfsburg and a convincing 2-0 victory over French league runner-up Marseille on Sunday.\"We have finally understood our worth and we have understood how important it is to prepare ourselves well, how difficult it is to win, what we need to stay at the highest levels, so I see the boys even readier for this season, even more prepared and with even more attention to detail,\" Milan coach Stefano Pioli said. \"I am convinced that this is a cycle that has just started and not one that is about to end.\"JUVENTUSMassimiliano Allegri returned as Juventus coach last year — two years after being fired — but the Bianconeri ended the season without a trophy for the first time in 11 years.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_2>The storied club won nine straight league titles until 2020 and even in Andrea Pirlo’s disappointing stint in charge the team still won the Italian Cup and Italian Super Cup.The Bianconeri were hoping Pogba could bring the glory days back after returning from Manchester United. But the France international continues to be plagued by injuries and could be out until the new year, missing the World Cup as well as a significant chunk of the season.Pogba sustained a knee injury during one of his first training sessions back at Juventus and now faces a decision on whether to opt for surgery which should fix the problem definitively but would see him out until 2023 or less invasive treatment with a shorter recovery time but which might not be as effective.Juventus has also signed midfielder Ángel Di María as a free agent after seven years at Paris Saint-Germain and defender Gleison Bremer from city rival Torino as it aims to improve on two straight fourth-place finishes.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_3>INTER MILANInter looks set to be Milan’s main challenger.After losing the title to its city rival, having ended its own lengthy wait the previous season, Inter moved swiftly in the transfer market to fulfil its aim of coach Simone Inzaghi having his squad ready for the start of pre-season.Inter signed midfielders Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Kristjan Asllani, and goalkeeper André Onana but most significantly it brought Lukaku back a year after his acrimonious departure to Chelsea.And Lukaku will be swiftly forgiven if he leads Inter to the title again.Lukaku scored 47 goals in 72 appearances in Serie A in his two previous seasons with Inter and formed a formidable partnership with Lautaro Martínez — dubbed \"LuLa\" by the Italian media — that helped the Nerazzurri win the league in 2021 for the first time in 11 years.OTHERSNapoli, Atalanta and Roma could also be dark horses for the title, although the trio boast only five scudetto wins between them, with the most recent being Roma’s Serie A victory in 2001.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_4>In Jose Mourinho’s first year in charge, he steered Roma to the Europa Conference League title — the club's first trophy in 14 years.Mourinho and Roma have even loftier ambitions this season. Having finished sixth last season in Serie A it will be targeting a top-four finish and a Champions League spot.But quietly the capital club could be hoping for even more, especially after the marquee signing of former Juventus forward Paulo Dybala.Napoli also can't be ruled out, if the team manages to keep up its title challenge for the whole season.It looked set to push the Milan teams all the way last campaign before a mid-season slump dented its title hopes. The team eventually finished third, seven points behind the Rossoneri.However, Napoli will also have to cope this year with the departure of players such as captain Lorenzo Insigne and all-time leading scorer Dries Mertens as well as defender Kalidou Koulibaly.After three straight third-place finishes, Atalanta’s eighth place last season will have been a disappointment to some. But it leaves the team coached by Gian Piero Gasperini free to focus on Serie A without the distraction of the Champions League — or any European soccer.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_5>Atalanta, which won Serie B in 2011, has never claimed Italian soccer’s top prize and a spot in the Champions League was already seen as an incredible achievement for the team from the small city of Bergamo, less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Milan.Beating its more illustrious neighbors to the Serie A title would be a feat beyond most fans’ wildest dreams.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/ac-milan-team-to-beat-serie-a-rivals-gear-up-knock-off-defending-champs", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Players of Milan pose for photo prior to the Friendly match between Marseille and Milan AC at Orange Velodrome on July 31, 2022 in Marseille, France.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AC-Milan-3-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Olivier Giroud of AC Milan #9 celebrates after scores the second goal during the Friendly match between Marseille and Milan AC at Orange Velodrome on July 31, 2022 in Marseille, France.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AC-Milan-2-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Two Teams Line-up during the Friendly match between Marseille and Milan AC at Orange Velodrome on July 31, 2022 in Marseille, France.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AC-Milan-1-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Tiémoué Bakayoko of AC Milan in action during the Friendly match between Marseille and Milan AC at Orange Velodrome on July 31, 2022 in Marseille, France.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AC-Milan-4-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Simon Kjaer of AC Milan in action during the Friendly match between Marseille and Milan AC at Orange Velodrome on July 31, 2022 in Marseille, France.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AC-Milan-5-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Theo Hernandez of AC Milan in action during the Friendly match between Marseille and Milan AC at Orange Velodrome on July 31, 2022 in Marseille, France.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25175_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/AC-Milan-6-copy.jpg"}]}
{"title": "Jamaica women's soccer qualifies for second straight World Cup amid tragedy", "body": "To borrow from native son Bob Marley, Jamaica is jammin'.Jamaica has qualified for the 2023 Women's World Cup as one of the top four finishers at the CONCACAF W Championship. The Reggae Girlz next face Canada on Thursday night in the tournament semifinals.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25195_News_0>Next summer's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will mark Jamaica's second appearance in soccer's premier tournament. They were the first-ever Caribbean team to make the field in 2019.The Reggae Girlz have made a dramatic climb onto the international stage. The team didn't exist just six years ago and it has had to constantly struggle for funding.\"There’s so much higher levels that we can reach with even more investment from back home,\" forward Kayla McCoy said. \"So we’re kind of excited to see what comes from us qualifying again, because not a lot of people thought we could do it again. I think it kind of solidified us into this position and now people know that that we’re for real and will begin to invest a bit more.\"The team was disbanded in 2008 after failing to qualify for the 2007 World Cup and the 2008 Olympics.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25195_News_1>In 2014, Bob and Rita Marley's eldest daughter, Cedella, made it her mission to resurrect the team. While Jamaica didn't qualify for the 2015 World Cup in Canada, the team attracted fans through its connection to the Marley family.Cedella Marley has been a tireless ambassador for the team, drumming up much-needed sponsors. A GoFundMe was once set up to help Jamaica train and players have held other fundraisers. But even with success, the Reggae Girlz struggle to get funding from the Jamaican federation.Jamaica has also overcome considerable turbulence at the helm in recent years. Coach Lorne Donaldson just took over at the beginning of June — he's had just a month with the team.After Hue Menzies resigned because of a pay dispute with the federation following the 2019 World Cup, he was replaced in 2020 by Hubert Busby Jr., who has been accused of sexual misconduct while coaching a women's club team in Canada. He has denied the allegations.Busby was dismissed late last year and Jamaica appointed Vin Blaine, who was forced to resign after 20 national team players sent a letter to the federation saying they could not support him.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25195_News_2>\"I think the important thing for us as a group is that we stuck together through everything and we overcame those challenges,\" McCoy said. \"The women on this team have had each other’s backs from the start and from the beginning, and I think the group that we have, and the family that we have is what has kept us going through all of this and what has kept us kind of overcoming those obstacles.\"There's also been personal tragedy during CONCACAF qualifying. A promising youth national team player, Jedine Carr, was killed in a shooting Friday while on her way to a club team practice in Jamaica.A moment of silence was used to honor Carr before the final group stage matches at the tournament. Khadija Shaw held up Carr's jersey when the team celebrated its victory over Haiti that secured its World Cup berth.Shaw, better known by her nickname Bunny, plays professionally for Manchester City and is Jamaica's biggest star. Just 25, she already has 38 goals in 56 appearances with the Reggae Girlz.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25195_News_3>Shaw scored a pair of goals in the 4-0 victory over Haiti. In celebration, Cedella Marley posted to Twitter: \"FIFA Women’s World Cup here we come. ... I am so proud, the entire country is so proud.\"And there's another Marley who has more recently taken up the cause. Skip Marley, Cedella's son, has allowed his song \"Lions\" to be used as the W Championship's official anthem.In addition to Jamaica's game against Canada on Thursday, the United States plays Costa Rica in the other semifinal.While those four teams have already locked up spots at the World Cup, there's another prize on the line for the winner of the tournament: a spot in the 2024 Olympics in France.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25195_News_4>Donaldson pointed out that the Jamaican team has already come a long way judging by its company in the semifinals. Canada won gold at the Tokyo Games and the United States is the two-time defending World Cup champion.\"Canada is the Olympic champion. So you have the Olympic champion and the world champion still in the tournament and we are with them.

{"title": "Gareth Bale ready to win with Los Angeles FC, not retire: 'I still have many years to come'", "body": "Gareth Bale wants the world to know Los Angeles FC is not the 18th hole of his soccer career.The golf-loving Welsh forward intends to keep playing for club and country for several more seasons, and he hopes to fill those years winning trophies with his new stateside team.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_0>\"I’m up for everything here,\" Bale said Monday. \"I still have many years to come. I haven’t come here to just be here for six months, 12 months. I’ve come here to try and be here for as long as possible. I want to do as well as I can. I want to try to make my mark on this league, on this team. I look forward to the future.\"Bale's declaration of his long-term intentions undoubtedly will please his new LAFC fans, who were hoping the longtime Real Madrid forward wasn't simply using the team atop the Major League Soccer standings as a place to get fit for Wales' landmark return to the World Cup in Qatar this fall after a 64-year absence.The 32-year-old Bale also gave a thrill to his home nation when he confirmed his intention to play in the 2024 European Championships, keeping his place among the greatest group of Welsh football talent in decades.\"It’s not just a short-term thing,\" Bale said. \"(LAFC) also gives me the best opportunity to go to the next Euros, maybe further. So my plan is to really work hard. ... We’ve got a great plan going forward to get me up to speed, and hopefully it lasts as long as possible.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_1>LAFC formally introduced Bale to an extensive media gathering inside Banc of California Stadium, but the club’s fans already met Bale outside on the field three days earlier. He got a standing ovation hours after getting off the plane from Europe last Friday, and he watched LAFC’s 3-2 victory over the archrival LA Galaxy from a suite before joining the on-field postgame celebrations with his new teammates.Bale went through his first training session with LAFC on Monday morning. While the club isn't projecting when he will suit up in their pursuit of the MLS title, the goal-scoring dynamo should be fresh: He played in only five matches for Madrid last season while battling injuries.After winning five Champions League titles while spending eight of the past nine seasons in Madrid, Bale explored playing options closer to home before choosing Los Angeles, where he can be a midseason addition to a trophy-contending team. Southern California’s ideal weather also puts him in the perfect spot to ramp up physically for Qatar.If LAFC makes it to the league title game, the MLS Cup Final is scheduled for Nov. 5, just 16 days before the start of the World Cup. While bigger clubs undoubtedly will come calling afterward, Bale insists he doesn't intend to leave after the MLS season.\"I haven’t come here for the short term,\" Bale said. \"I want to make my mark on this league, and I think being here gives me the best possible chance to make it to the Euros, and you never know, maybe one more (World Cup). That’s my goal.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_2>The expiration of his massive contract finally ended the love-hate relationship between the superstar and the Madrid fans and media. While Bale repeatedly showed off his big-game scoring ability, he was criticized for everything from his frequent injury absences to his passion for golf amid suggestions he wasn't fully committed to Madrid's success.Bale began his U.S. tenure by repeatedly reaffirming his desire to play regularly, even with the demanding travel schedule of the vast North American league.Bale is joining longtime Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini in making a midseason move to LAFC, and general manager John Thorrington hailed their decisions as evidence LAFC has become \"a destination of choice for star players.\"Bale said he spent a few weeks every summer in Los Angeles before the coronavirus pandemic, and his family is already comfortable in the city where soccer greats from David Beckham and Robbie Keane to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Carlos Vela have embraced the combination of sporting challenge and good living in the second halves of their careers.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_3>But as those superstars did before him, Bale rejects the concept of joining MLS and slowing down. LAFC has been the league's top team throughout its fifth season of existence, and a motivated Bale's addition to an already potent attack could be a nightmare for the competition between now and November.\"The standard here is really increasing,\" Bale said. \"I think it’s a lot better than people in Europe really think.\"", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/gareth-bale-win-los-angeles-fc-not-retire", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Gareth Bale poses for photos after being introduced as a new member of the Los Angeles FC MLS soccer club Monday, July 11, 2022, in Los Angeles.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Gareth-Bale-holding-the-scarf-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Gareth Bale poses for photos after being introduced as a new member of the Los Angeles FC MLS soccer club Monday, July 11, 2022, in Los Angeles.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Gareth-Bale-jersey-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Gareth Bale fields questions as he is introduced as a new member of the Los Angeles FC MLS soccer club Monday, July 11, 2022, in Los Angeles.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Gareth-Bale-talking-copy.jpg"}, {"caption": "Gareth Bale gives a thumbs-up as he is introduced as a new member of the Los Angeles FC MLS soccer club Monday, July 11, 2022, in Los Angeles.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_25199_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/Gareth-Bale-thumbs-up-copy.jpg"}]}

We thought we had a good plan and played well at the start. The last 85 minutes were horrible.\"<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25200_News_1>The size of the result did not reflect the status of the teams in the FIFA rankings with England at No. 8 and Norway at No. 11.England became the first team to score seven in a European Championship game when Russo headed in from Bronze's delivery in the 66th.\"We made it a little bit too easy for them,\" Sjögren said, \"losing the ball in dangerous places. We made some very, very bad mistakes.\"Mead scored twice in four minutes of the first half, and completed the hat trick in the second with a tap-in from close range after Kiera Walsh's shot was parried.\"What’s going on here?

{"title": "Madrid held at Villarreal before PSG; Bale makes rare start", "body": "The only positive that Real Madrid could take away from its scoreless draw with Villarreal on Saturday was Gareth Bale, whose good form belied his return to the pitch after more than five months on the sidelines.The stalemate left Madrid four points clear of second-placed Sevilla as the Spanish league leader continues to struggle without injured striker Karim Benzema, and with their Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain just three days away.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25336_News_0><IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25336_News_1>Bale had not played for Madrid since he made three appearances in August. Then a series of injuries and a COVID-19 infection ensured he fell out of Carlo Ancelotti’s rotation in favor of younger players such as Vinícius Júnior and Marco Asensio. During that period, however, he did play three World Cup qualifiers for Wales, twice in September and once in November.With Benzema recovering from a left hamstring pull, Ancelotti gave Bale the nod to play as his striker. Bale needed almost the entire first half to finally get involved, but once he did, he showed the same ability he always had to produce scoring chances.\"(Bale) had his opportunity and he made the most of it. He could have scored, he gave us a threat up front, he did all we asked of him,\" Ancelotti said about the former star who returned to Madrid last summer after his loan to Tottenham.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25336_News_2><IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25336_News_3>Only the goalkeeping of Gerónimo Rulli stopped Bale on three occasions, including one shot he pushed onto his bar in the 56th minute. Late substitute Luka Jovic almost grabbed a stoppage-time winner on the break when he sent his chipped shot onto the bar.Villarreal, which moved into fifth place, was also without its top striker as Gerard Moreno nursed a right leg injury.Villarreal, however, got the better of Madrid in an intense, and sometimes testy, first half.Besides his surprise choice of Bale, Ancelotti also started the sparingly used Marcelo on the left side of his defense. Marcelo, whose contract is up in June, was slow to keep up with winger Samuel Chukwueze, while new arrival Giovani Lo Celso cued Villarreal’s passing attack.A pass by Lo Celso set up Arnaut Danjuma in the heart of the area for back-to-back chances in the 18th. David Alaba blocked his first shot and the follow-up effort hit the post.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25336_News_4>But it was Chukwueze and right back Juan Foyth who repeatedly surged past Marcelo on Villareal’s right flank that forced Madrid’s defense to scramble into its box.Only Vinícius could respond for the pacesetters, but he spent as much time complaining about the rough treatment by defenders as he did tormenting the opponent.Tempers flared midway through the half when Dani Carvajal kicked the ball into the face of the prone Lo Celso.

Alex Callens converted on his attempt to clinch the shootout, 4-2.Afterward, a teammate filled the cup with champagne and handed it to Johnson, who took a drink. Johnson has been in MLS since 2010, first with the Chicago Fire. He joined the NYCFC in 2017.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25391_News_0>\"What a ride so far, this journey was crazy this year. So many up so many downs,\" Johnson said. \"We talked amongst ourselves before the game and just said it’s a massive opportunity to make it all worth it. And this is what we live for, these moments. To be to be the MVP of the finals, I mean it means the world, but it means so much more to lift the cup for this for this club.\"Golden Boot winner Valentin \"Taty\" Castellanos scored in the opening half and it appeared that NYCFC was on its way to the league championship in regulation, but Portland's Felipe Mora scored in stoppage time to give the Timbers hope.Johnson NYCFC's captain, stopped PKs from Mora and Diego Valeri in the shootout after the two teams went scoreless in extra time.\"I just wanted to make sure that we stayed level, we’ve been in that position before. I told the guys that we have the experience, not to panic, not to get down on ourselves, because there’s more of an opportunity to go forward and win the game,\" he said about guiding the team to the finish.NYCFC celebrated in front of the goal after Callens converted, while Valeri lay in the middle of the field in disbelief.

Coach Ronny Delia stripped down to his underwear and lifted the trophy.\"I don’t regret that, it was a big moment,\" Delia said. \"I will keep on doing that if we keep on winning trophies.\"NYCFC, which joined the league in 2015, had never advanced to the title game.Castellanos, who had 19 goals in the regular season, was back in the starting lineup after missing the Eastern Conference final against Philadelphia. The Argentine striker was handed a red card in the conference semifinals against the top-seeded New England Revolution, which NYCFC won on a penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw.New York's 2-1 victory over at Philadelphia secured NYCFC a place in the MLS Cup final. NYCFC was the fourth seed in the East after finishing the regular season 14-9-11.The Timbers were also seeded fourth after going 17-13-4 in the regular season.

Before we learn something from it, we need to feel and understand the emotions that we’re going to have after this match, not to achieve what was our goal, to lift the trophy at home,\" Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said. \"We couldn’t have thought about more beautiful situation for us than lifting that trophy. So the first thing is manage our emotions and come to the realization that it happened this way. The game can be cruel.\"The game was chippy at the start, with a brief skirmish breaking out in the 25th minute. Players also had to endure rather nasty weather conditions with temperatures in the 40s, steady rain and gusty winds.Castellanos scored on a header off a free kick from Maxi Moralez in the 40th minute, giving NYCFC the early lead. The goal celebration was marred when it appeared that New York's Jesus Medina was struck by an object thrown by a fan.It was the first set-piece goal that the Timbers had allowed in 20 games.The Timbers at times looked disorganized. Mora had one of the best chances in the second half, but his shot in the 81st minute fell directly in the hands Johnson. He had another in the 97th but his header sailed well over the net.Mora finally broke through in the final moments of four-minutes of stoppage time. It was the latest goal ever scored in regulation in an MLS Cup.But the goal was controversial. NYCFC players argued that it should be disallowed, claiming that Maxime Chanot was fouled by Portland's Larrys Mabiala in the run-up. In the end,<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25391_News_3>\"The first half was a little bit difficult, because New York tried to control the ball, control the game. They found a way to score on us, and made it more difficult on us,\" Portland's Diego Chara said. \"In the second half, we found a way to tie the game. I think after that it was different for us, getting confidence, playing with the ball, and we created a lot of opportunities.\"Valeri came in as a sub in the 89th minute as speculation about the 35-year-old forward's retirement swirls.Valeri was with the Timbers when they won the MLS Cup in 2015, scoring in the opening moments of the 2-1 victory over the Columbus Crew.

The future National Women’s Soccer League pro reflected on an incredible collegiate career with the Broncos in an interview with Fox News Thursday.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25395_News_0>\"It’s just been such an honor to play for such an incredible program. There’s so much history in the program and so much success. And our goal was to bring the program back to the College Cup and hopefully win a championship,\" Turnbow said. \"I’m really proud that we were able to do that this past year, within the past two seasons in 2021.\"Something I love so much about our program is that we are not only growing as soccer players but as overall people as well. I think that’s truly special and original. I couldn’t be more blessed for the past five years.\"Turnbow and the Broncos played two seasons in one year. The 2020-21 season was played between February and May, while the 2021-22 season was played from August to December.In the first half of the year, Turnbow scored an equalizing goal in the national championship to eventually force the game into penalty shots, and Santa Clara defeated No. 1-seeded Florida State. The win brought Santa Clara its first women’s soccer national title since 2001. The team finished 15-5-3 overall in the second half of the year and lost to BYU in the College Cup semifinal.  <IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25395_News_1>Over the course of the calendar year, she scored 21 goals and added 16 assists along with nine game-winners.Turnbow, who spoke to Fox News on behalf of ChiliSleep, a company for which she became a brand ambassador earlier this year, said winning the College Cup and being able to play the final match of her career in what amounted to a home game in Santa Clara were some of the top moments in her career.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25395_News_2>\"I have two actually and both are within in the College Cup,\" she said. \"Obviously the national championship, you can’t beat that. That was so special, especially during COVID. We overcame so much adversity during that season and for us to come away with a national championship under our belt it was absolutely huge.\"My second moment would be just the final four the other day playing against BYU in our home stadium. We felt so much love and support from our Bronco community, and we were playing in front of like 8,000 people, and it was basically a home game. It was a neutral site but basically a home game, and it made me feel just so proud to be a Santa Clara Bronco.\"The star forward will now turn her attention to preparing for her first National Women’s Soccer League season. She was initially selected by the Chicago Red Stars in the 2021 NWSL Draft but was traded to the expansion San Diego Wave FC earlier this month along with Katie Johnson and Makenzy Doniak.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_25395_News_3>She told Fox News she was ready for the next level.\"I could not be more excited to play pro soccer,\" she said. \"It’s been a dream of mine ever since I was a little girl. Becoming a college athlete and experiencing that, and now I’m making the next step of playing professional soccer in one of the best leagues in the entire world is just such a privilege. And it takes a village and I couldn’t have gotten to this position alone – my family, my coaches, my mentors, teammates, friends, you name it — have all played such a huge role in this journey.

Shim said she had a similar experience.The Thorns said last week Riley was placed on administrative leave during an investigation in 2015 but the probe yielded \"clear violations of our company policies\" and severed ties with him.

{"title": "Liverpool break 44-match undefeated streak after 3-0 defeat to Watford", "body": "Arsenal's class of 2003-04 can breathe easy: Liverpool will not be joining them as Premier League “Invincibles.”“Phew...” was the immediate reaction from Arsenal's Twitter account after Liverpool collapsed to its first league loss of the season on Saturday, a 3-0 defeat at Watford - a team languishing in the relegation zone.It marked the end of a 44-match undefeated streak and a record-tying 18-match winning run for Liverpool in the league.Juergen Klopp's team headed to Vicarage Road as the champions-in-waiting - with its record 22-point lead - and needing to get through 11 more matches to also become only the second side after Arsenal to complete a full season unbeaten since the start of the Premier League in 1992. Preston also went through the 1888-89 season undefeated.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26353_News_0>Liverpool was five games short of matching Arsenal's 49-match unbeaten streak in the Premier League from May 2003 to October 2004. That run ended when Arsenal lost 2-0 at Manchester United.Few could have foreseen the manner of Liverpool's meltdown against Watford, which scored all of its goals in the second half through Ismaila Sarr (two) and Troy Deeney.Thankfully for Liverpool fans desperate to see their team back on top of English soccer for the first time in 30 years, the loss is far from terminal.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26353_News_1>Four wins from their last 10 games will see the Reds become champions for the 19th time.“There is no reason for panic,” Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk said.“The (unbeaten) record, and the talk of the records, is all media. We just try to win every game ahead of us.”The performance will be a major concern, though, coming soon after a 1-0 loss to Atletico Madrid in their first leg in the Champions League's last 16.Indeed, Liverpool's players have been far below their usual high standards since returning from the Premier League's first midseason break, having edged past last-place Norwich 1-0 and coming from behind to beat another team fighting relegation, West Ham, 3-2 on Monday. The loss to Atletico was sandwiched between those league matches.The absence of captain Jordan Henderson, who sustained a hamstring injury against Atletico, has been significant, while the defense looked ragged against Watford with Dejan Lovren filling in at center back for Joe Gomez.Liverpool's next game is at Chelsea in the FA Cup on Tuesday.“We want to strike back, we want to show what we’ve been doing the whole season,” Van Dijk said. “That’s the only way forward.”<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26353_News_2>While Chelsea’s forwards continue to struggle to score, at least the team can rely on its left back to find the back of the net.Marcos Alonso made it three goals in two games since returning to the lineup after a two-month absence when he scored twice - including an 85th-minute equalizer - in a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth.\"Marcos Alonso has had a big week,” Chelsea manager Frank Lampard said, “but I don't want my left back top of the scoring charts. I want our attackers scoring goals and they haven't.”Alonso netted what proved to be the winning goal against Tottenham last weekend, only to get sent off in the 3-0 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League’s last 16 on Tuesday.The draw lifted fourth-place Chelsea four points ahead of fifth-place Manchester United having played a game more.United visits Everton on Sunday. They are two of the eight teams within nine points of Chelsea.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26353_News_3>Just when his team looked like being sucked into a relegation battle, former England manager Roy Hodgson has inspired Crystal Palace to back-to-back victories and most probably another season in the Premier League.The 72-year Hodgson is poised for talks with the Palace board about a contract extension next week, and can go into them feeling fairly content about another solid season’s work in the wake of a 1-0 win at Brighton.“If they go well,” Hodgson said about upcoming games against relegation candidates Watford and Bournemouth, “we can kiss relegation goodbye.”The same cannot be said for Brighton after being hit by the sucker-punch of a goal against the run of play by Jordan Ayew.Brighton is now only one point above the relegation zone.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26353_News_4>Can the signing of a player from the second-tier League Championship be the catalyst for West Ham in its bid to secure safety in the Premier League?Jarrod Bowen’s lively performance in the 3-1 win over Southampton suggested so.Handed his first start since joining from Hull in the January transfer window, Bowen opened the scoring with a deft chip over goalkeeper Alex McCarthy and was a constant danger with his movement and pace in behind.\"That's the way it went in my dreams last night,” Bowen said.West Ham manager David Moyes has eased Bowen into the team, despite the player’s superb scoring record - he struck 16 goals for Hull this season - and the team’s lack of potency of late.Sebastian Haller and Michail Antonio also scored for West Ham, which moved out of the bottom three and above Bournemouth and Aston Villa in the standings with its first win since Jan. 1.Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuettl described the goals his team conceded as “an absolute joke.”If only Hasenhuettl had a defense boasting the tenacity of Newcastle and Burnley.

{"title": "Bulgarian goalie claims England players ‘overreacted’ to racist taunts, praises home fans", "body": "Bulgaria's national team goalie claims that the home fans “behaved well” when his side played England on Monday – in a match that had to be paused at least twice because of an onslaught of racist abuse and Nazi salutes targeting the away team’s black players.Plamen Iliev – who allowed in six goals – praised the home fans during the Euro 2020 qualifier and suggested that the English players “overreacted a bit.”<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26475_News_0>“If I am honest, I believe they [the fans] behaved well today,” he told reporters after the match, according to the Guardian. “There wasn’t any abuse [as far as I could hear] and I think they [the England players] overreacted a bit. The public was on a good level – I didn’t hear any bad language used towards their or our players.”<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26475_News_1>The match was twice halted in the first half because of fans directing monkey chants at English players, doing Nazi salutes and holding up shirts with the UEFA logo and the text “No Respect” – a reference to the European governing body’s “Respect” campaign aimed at curbing racism in the sport.The English FA issued a statement saying that England players “were subjected to abhorrent racist chanting,” which seemed to be aimed mainly at black players like Raheem Sterling and Tyrone Mings.\"As we are sadly aware, this is not the first time our players have been subjected to this level of abuse and there is no place for this kind of behavior in society, let alone in football. We will be asking UEFA to investigate as a matter of urgency,\" the FA said.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26475_News_2>Despite this, Bulgaria’s manager, Krasimir Balakov, claimed that he did not personally hear the chanting.“I saw the referee stopped the game but I also have to say the behavior was also not only on behalf of the Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgarian national anthem,” he told reporters after the game.Iliev and Balakov’s comments contrasted heavily from those of Bulgarian captain, Ivelin Popov, who tried to calm things down during the match.“We’re all suffering from that kind of behavior,” he said. “Do you think a foreign player would like to come and play in Bulgaria after what happened tonight? Racism is a world problem that needs to be eradicated. We’re all people regardless of the skin color.”On Tuesday, Borislav Mikhailov, the president of Bulgaria’s soccer federation resigned amid the controversy. The soccer body said in a statement that he will present his resignation to the federation’s executive committee on Friday.A few hours later, Bulgarian special police forces raided the federation offices. It was unclear what they were looking for.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26475_News_3>Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov condemned the racist behavior.\"It is unacceptable that Bulgaria, one of the most tolerant countries in the world where people of different ethnicities live in peace, to be associated with racism and xenophobia,\" Borissov wrote in a post on Facebook.FIFA has rules protecting soccer federations from government interference, including suspension as a possible punishment.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/bulgaria-england-racism-taunts-goalie-overreacted", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_26475_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Plamen Iliev of Bulgaria during the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifier between Bulgaria and England on October 14, 2019 in Sofia, Bulgaria.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_26475_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Plamen-Iliev-Getty.jpg"}, {"caption": "England manager Gareth Southgate, right, speaks with Referee Ivan Bebek during the Euro 2020 group A qualifying soccer match between Bulgaria and England, at the Vasil Levski national stadium, in Sofia, Bulgaria, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.

It was the U.S. team’s first goal of the tournament and their only allowed goal since their 5-3 win against Australia on April 4.It’s not just fans looking forward to Friday’s matchup. Rapinoe said she hopes in a “complete spectacle” and “an absolute media circus.”“I hope it’s huge and crazy. That’s what it should be. This is the best game, this is what everybody wanted,” she said after the match was set. “I think we want it. Seems like they’re up for it. [The media] of course are up for it, and all the fans. Maybe it’ll be a pretty even split between the fans in the stadium. We’ve been traveling pretty deep in this World Cup.”She added: “I hope it’s just a total s--t show circus. It’s gonna be totally awesome. I think this is what everybody wants and these are the biggest games that you dream about as a kid.”Coach Jill Ellis was a bit more subdued when talking about the upcoming match.“So many times when we play in big games, it’s actually where I get more excited,” Ellis said, according to Sports Illustrated. “So when we have our pregame meetings, it’s more. Because it means more, it matters more, there’s more at stake, and that’s why you do this. You don’t go into one, professional sports, or two, coaching, if you’re not in it for those purposes and those reasons.”The U.S. and France last played on Jan. 19 in an international friendly. France got the better of the U.S., winning 3-1 at Stade Oceane Le Havre. Mallory Pugh was the only American to score in the match.

She said they were pre-planned changes that showed the team’s depth and versatility.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_26814_News_2>“It’s always good to have (and) try players who can adapt and adjust and play any position needed,” she added.The substitutes in the second half made quite the impact with Carli Lloyd, 36, teeing up Mallory Pugh, 21, to double the lead in the 76th minute.

{"title": "2018 World Cup stadiums hosting matches in Russia: A guide", "body": "<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_0>The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be here before you know it.Some of soccer’s biggest names will compete in the 64-game tournament, which will be held in 12 different stadiums across Russia over the next few weeks.These spaces, spread across 11 different cities, can hold tens of thousands of people. (The “anticipated gross capacity” for each of the venues in a “finished state” is listed below and comes from FIFA.)Read on to see where the matches will take place and what else you should know.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_1> 35,000Kaliningrad Stadium is located in Kaliningrad, which is the capital of a sliver of Russian land cut off from the rest of the country and nestled between Poland and Lithuania.FIFA says the venue was constructed “on Oktyabrsky Island, right in the heart of Kaliningrad.”“The selection of Kaliningrad as a host city has prompted the local authorities to develop the island, which for many centuries has been a wilderness, left largely untouched,\" FIFA added.The stadium is a compact, modest design which has been built quickly. There have been repeated allegations of corruption involving the stadium, including several arrests.Fans can expect to see four group stage games unfold there.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_2> 67,000Saint Petersburg Stadium is located in the northern Russian city of the same name - and its design is out of this world.“The architect's vision for Saint Petersburg Stadium was of a spaceship that has landed on the shores of the Gulf of Finland,” according to FIFA.The stadium also has other features.“Equipped with a retractable roof and a sliding pitch, it’s able to host any type of event at any time of year - even in winter, the temperature inside the stadium is 15 degrees Celsius,” the association says.Saint Petersburg Stadium hasn't been without issues.Severe delays and soaring costs were just the start for a project which became notorious for employing North Korean laborers, one of whom was among at least eight people to die on the stadium and 17 across all World Cup construction sites, according to the trade union Building and Wood Workers’ International.A deputy governor of St. Petersburg has also admitted his role in a $850,000 scheme to siphon off the stadium’s budget, though officials say the true picture of corruption was much larger.The arena remains plagued by a leaking roof and a pitch which had to be replaced repeatedly. Confederations Cup games, however, passed largely without incident and Russia says it’s working to iron out any remaining problems.During the World Cup, the stadium will host the third-place match after hosting a semi-final and four group stage matches.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_3>80,000Originally built in 1956 to showcase the sporting might of the Soviet Union, this Moscow stadium has been transformed to host the World Cup final, which will take place on July 15.“Work to rebuild Luzhniki Stadium for Russia 2018 began in 2013,” FIFA says online. “One of the crucial aspects of the project was preserving the historical façade of the stadium, which has become one of Moscow’s true landmarks.” The stadium reopened in November.Aside from the final, the stadium will host four group stage matches, a knockout match and a semi-final.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_4> 45,000This stadium, which opened in 2014, is also located in Moscow and serves as the home of the Spartak Moscow soccer team. It is usually known as the Otkritie Arena, but FIFA rules on sponsorship mean a temporary name change for the tournament.FIFA explains the stadium’s design features online.“Its façade takes the form of chain mail consisting of hundreds of little diamonds representing the Spartak logo,” FIFA says. “The façade can be changed depending on which team is playing. For Spartak matches, the arena is bathed in red-and-white; when the national team is in town, it switches to the colours of the Russian flag.”The towering statue of a gladiator outside is a nod to Spartak being named after the Roman slave rebel Spartacus.Four group stage games will unfold at the stadium, as well as a knockout game.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_5> 45,000Rostov Arena is located in Rostov-on-Don.“Rostov Arena’s original design blends harmoniously into the picturesque landscape. The shape of the arena’s roof imitates the meanderings of the Don River,\" FIFA explains.The stadium is supposed to become the center of a vast new housing and leisure development after the World Cup, and will also be the new home of the soccer team FC Rostov.Four group stage matches and a knockout match will happen at this venue.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_6>48,000Nestled by the Black Sea, Fisht Stadium in Sochi hosted the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2014 Winter Olympics.“Fisht Stadium was originally named after Mount Fisht, a peak in the Caucasus range of mountains,” FIFA says online. “In the local language, Adygeyan, 'fisht' means 'white head.'”After four group stage matches, fans can expect to see a knockout match and a quarterfinal happen here.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27016_News_7> 45,000Volgograd Arena is located in Volgograd, which was once known as Stalingrad.“The design for the façade supports and the windbreaks embody aspects of a Victory Day firework display,” FIFA says. “The special way in which the stadium’s roof has been constructed, with cables reminiscent of the spokes of the wheel on a bicycle, lends the arena an extra element of airiness.”Workers during construction had to deal with finding unexploded munitions and soldiers’ corpses from the Battle of Stalingrad.The stadium sits at the foot of Russia’s best-known World War II memorial.

{"title": "World Cup 2018 teams to watch, from Germany to Iceland", "body": "Thirty-two teams are competing in Russia for the 2018 World Cup, including defending champion Germany.Brazil is favored to win the World Cup, but France came ready to play with a team loaded with talent, and Portugal fans are confident Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo will lead them to victory. Iceland, too, has emerged as a 2018 fan favorite as the tiny Nordic nation qualified for the tournament for the first time in its history.From the teams that could win it all to those that barely made the tournament, read on for a look at the teams to watch.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_0>Defending World Cup champion Germany is trying to be the first team since Brazil in 1962 to win back-to-back trophies. Germany is ranked No. 1 by FIFA.Coached by Joachim Löw, Germany finished third at the 2010 World Cup and made it to the semifinals at the Euro 2012 before winning the 2014 World Cup. Captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer had missed much of this season with a foot fracture but said he feels “very good” ahead of the World Cup.Germany has made 18 World Cup appearances and has won four titles. Germany plays Mexico in its first match and is based in Moscow for the tournament.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_1>Brazil hosted the 2014 World Cup and lost to Germany, the eventual winner, in a devastating semifinal that ended 1-7. The country is ranked No. 2 by FIFA ahead of the tournament and favored to win the championship.Captain Neymar da Silva Santos Junior -- or Neymar -- is one of the tournament’s biggest stars. At 26 years old, Neymar recently suffered from a broken foot -- putting him out of the game for about three months -- but the forward’s readmittance on the team has made Brazil an even greater force to be reckoned with.Brazil has made 20 World Cup appearances and has won five titles. It will have its base in Sochi despite playing no games near the Black Sea resort. Coached by Adenor Leonardo Bachi, nicknamed “Tite,” its first match will be played against Switzerland.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_2>Fans of Egypt’s team have their fingers crossed for Mohamed Salah’s return from a shoulder injury. On Monday, the team doctor said a final decision on Salah’s return has not yet been reached and floated the possibility of him starting from the bench.Ranked No. 45, Egypt has only made two World Cup appearances, winning none of them. This year’s World Cup is the first in 28 years that Egypt even qualified for. In 1934 and 1990, Egypt didn’t advance past the opening round.Based in Grozny, Egypt will take on Uruguay for its first match of the 2018 tournament. The team is expected to make history, however, with its goalkeeper; at 45 years old, Essam el-Hadary could become the oldest player to ever compete at a World Cup<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_3>For the first time in 36 years, Peru is back to the World Cup, this time with Argentine coach Ricardo Gareca, who has history with the team. In 1986, Gareca played for Argentina and scored a goal that ended Peru’s qualification chances.Ranked No. 11, Peru has won no World Cup titles but has made four appearances. Peru’s first match will be against Denmark.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_4>For Argentina fans, it’s all about Lionel Messi, the 30-year-old star Barcelona forward. And this year’s tournament could be Messi’s last chance to secure that coveted FIFA trophy.Coached by Jorge Sampaoli, Argentina is ranked fifth by FIFA. The team has made it to the World Cup 16 times, winning two titles, the last of which was in 1986. For the 2018 tournament, Argentina is based in Moscow and will play Iceland for its first match.Argentina has faced a series of setbacks that could hinder its bid for glory. Usual goalkeeper Sergio Romero was left off the squad due to a knee injury and midfielder Manuel Lanzini was dropped from the roster after rupturing his ACL during team training in Russia. Likewise, midfielder Lucas Biglia and striker Sergio Aguero have suffered recent injuries, and defender Javier Mascherano, 34, is coming to the end of his career.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_5>In the lead up to the 2018 World Cup, Uruguay, coached by Oscar Tabarez, finished second behind Brazil and automatically qualifying for the tournament.Fans are also hoping striker Luiz Suarez can keep his mouth closed -- literally. In 2014, Suarez was expelled from the tournament after he bit an Italian player. Suarez has said he knows he has “a debt to repay” to his country and wants to “try to show a good image” at this year’s tournament.Ranked No. 14, Uruguay has appeared in 12 World Cups and won two titles. Uruguay is based in Nizhny Novgorod and plays Egypt in its first match of this year’s tournament. According to Sporting News, it has made it past the group round in four of the last five tournaments.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_6>Ranked No. 7, coach Didier Deschamps has a bevy of talented players with the France team, especially when it comes to forwards.Because of all that talent, fans are hoping France will at least make it to the semi-finals this year. It has Raphael Varane on defense, Paul Pogba in midfield and Hugo Lloris at the goal. And Deschamps’ contract doesn’t expire until 2020.France has won one World Cup and has appeared in the tournament 14 times. In 1998, France both hosted and won the World Cup.Based in Moscow, France takes on Australia for its first match of the 2018 contest.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_7>Coming into the tournament at No. 4, Portugal won the Euro in 2016 and has Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, a five-time FIFA world player of the year, in its corner. And by sitting out some less meaningful matches, Ronaldo has had plenty of rest in preparation of the World Cup.Coached by Fernando Santos, Portugal will play Spain in its first match of tournament. In all, the team has made six appearances at the World Cup, winning none. In Russia this year, Portugal is based in Moscow.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_8>It’s the 2018 World Cup Cinderella team as the Nordic nation heads to the tournament. Iceland has never been to the World Cup and is the smallest nation ever to qualify for the tournament with a population of just 330,000. Its fans are passionate and celebrate the team with gigantic Viking thunderclaps.Iceland made its first appearance at the European Championship two years ago where it made it all the way to the quarterfinals. At the tournament, Iceland shocked fans with its defeat of England. Coach Heimar Hallgrimsson is a fan favorite, too, as coaching isn’t his only job; back in Iceland, Hallgrimsson also runs a dental surgery clinic in a small town.Ranked No. 22 by FIFA, Iceland will meet Argentina for its first World Cup match ever. The team is based in Krasnodar.<IMG Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_9>The last time a host nation won the World Cup was in 1998 with France coming out victorious. This year, don’t expect Russia to have the same luck. The team only has 30-1 odds of winning, according to Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.Because Russia is hosting the tournament, it’s also the first team to play, matching up with Saudi Arabia for the only match on June 14. Coached by Stanislav Cherchesov, Russia is ranked 70th and has won zero World Cup titles. It has made 10 appearances.Russia is going into the World Cup without a win in its past seven games after drawing 1-1 with an under-strength Turkey team just a week before the tournament.", "page_url": "http://foxnews.com//sports/world-cup-2018-teams-to-watch-from-germany-to-iceland", "page_id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News", "imgs": [{"caption": "Defending World Cup champion Germany is hoping to win back-to-back trophies and become the first team to do so since Brazil in 1962.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_0", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18163479008965.jpg"}, {"caption": "Brazil has won five World Cup titles overall.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_1", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18163382242789.jpg"}, {"caption": "Egypt has never won a World Cup and has only made it to the tournament twice before, with the last time being in 1990.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_2", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18161600974384.jpg"}, {"caption": "Peru is ranked No. 11 ahead of the tournament.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_3", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18161601481162.jpg"}, {"caption": "Argentina has won two World Cup titles and fans are hoping forward Lionel Messi can bring that to three in the 2018 tournament.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_4", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18163479830379.jpg"}, {"caption": "Uruguay's Luiz Suarez got himself banned from soccer for several months after he bit Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini in the 2014 World Cup.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_5", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18159020719744.jpg"}, {"caption": "Coached by Didier Deschamps, France is hoping to bring home its second World Cup.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_6", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18163585564291.jpg"}, {"caption": "Portugal fans are hoping Cristiano Ronaldo, a five-time world player of the year, can earn his country's first World Cup.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_7", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18161595356656.jpg"}, {"caption": "Iceland is a fan favorite as this is the first time its gone to the World Cup.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_8", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18161600897111.jpg"}, {"caption": "Russia, the host team, only has a 30-1 odds of winning the tournament.", "id": "Fox_Sports_Soccer_27022_News_9", "src": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18150449465040.jpg"}]}
